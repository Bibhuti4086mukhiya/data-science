Janata Samajwadi Party (JSP) Chairman Upendra Yadav, who lost to Janamat Party Chairman CK Raut in the House of Representatives (HoR) constituency of Saptari-2 in November 2022, may again have to suffer at the hands of Raut.
This by-election in Bara-2 will be a battle between the waning pre-eminent force in Madhes, JSP, and the rising force, Janamat Party, that hopes to one day overtake JSP as the strongest party in the plains.
Raut recognizing that his party will have to directly compete with JSP if it wishes to become a major force in Madhes ushered Shiv Chandra Kushwaha into Janamat Party from CPN (Maoist Center) to defeat Yadav in the by-election in Bara-2.
Many say JSP Chairman Yadav made his confidant Ram Sahay Prasad Yadav, who was elected from Bara-2, vice-president to contest the by-election from that constituency with a big population of Yadavs where JSP has very strong organization.
Setopati reached all the wards in the constituency, which includes three municipalities and two rural municipalities, and talked with 560 voters about the upcoming by-election, their preferred parties/candidates, the reasons for their preference, and the most important issues for them, among other things.
The constituency includes the whole of Mahagadhimai and Pachrauta municipalities; Suvarna, Devtal and Karaiyamai rural municipalities; and Ward Number 8 of Kolhabi Municipality.
Just 3,000-4,000 of around 125,000 voters in the constituency are of hill origin while the Yadavs constitute the biggest community here. The Pachpaunia community, which also includes Janamat Party candidate Kushwaha, is the second biggest community while the constituency also includes Madhesi Dalits, Tharus and Muslims.

A whopping 199 (35.5%) of the 560 voters Setopati talked to said that they would vote for Kushwaha—who had secured 13,823 votes contesting as the common coalition candidate on a Maoist ticket and lost to Ram Sahay Prasad Yadav by just 355 votes in the November election—while 161 (28.7) said that they would vote for Upendra Yadav.
Sixty-two (11%) of them said that they would vote for Ramesh Kharel of Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) while 59 (10.5%) pledged to vote for Purushottam Paudel of CPN-UML meaning the two would have a close fight for the third position.
Thirty-one (5.5%) of them said that they would vote for Arun Gyawali of Janata Party led by Prabhu Sah while 48 (8.5%) of the voters said that they had yet to decide who to vote for.
Janamat Party seems set to attract most votes from JSP in the constituency.
Fifty-eight of the 199 who pledged to vote for Kushwaha said that they had voted for JSP in November, 27 said that they had voted for CPN (Maoist Center), 18 for independent candidates, and 11 had not voted in November due to different reasons. Similarly, 16 pledged to vote for Janamat Party despite being affiliated to Nepali Congress (NC).
Ninety-four of the 161 who pledged to vote for Upendra Yadav said that they had voted for JSP also in November and 17 said that they had voted for independent candidates. Twenty-eight said that they supported NC and would vote for Yadav as he was the common coalition candidate, and nine said that they supported Maoist Center and would vote for Yadav for the same reason. Four said that they would vote for Yadav despite supporting UML while six said that they had not voted in November due to different reasons.
JSP also seems to be leaking votes to RSP that has fielded Ramesh Kharel, who had resigned from the post of DIG of Nepal Police and made a name for himself serving as SP in Parsa district in the past. Kharel himself has been campaigning as SP Kharel to capitalize on that goodwill while some voters also said they would vote for him due to RSP President Rabi Lamichhane.
Sixteen of the 62 who pledged to vote for RSP’s Kharel said that they had voted for JSP in November while six are first-time voters. Nine said they would vote for Kharel despite being NC supporters while three UML supporters also pledged to vote for him.
All the 59 voters who pledged to vote for UML candidate Paudel said they would vote for him as they support UML. This shows that it will be hard for UML, which had supported Ram Sahay Prasad Yadav in the constituency in November, to attract voters from other parties even as it looks set to leak votes to Janamat Party, RSP and even JSP.
This does not mean Upendra Yadav will definitely lose or Kushwaha will be elected as voting takes place more than a week later and voters may swing during the intervening period. But the fact that Yadav looks behind in the race in Bara-2 that remains a JSP stronghold to the party with no organization in the constituency should be a matter of grave concern for Yadav.
JSP’s Ram Sahay Prasad Yadav had not just defeated common coalition candidate Kushwaha, who was supported by NC, but JSP was also the largest party in the constituency on the basis of Proportional Representation (PR) electoral system votes securing 13,242 votes. NC was second with 11,179, followed by UML 9,193, Janamat Party 8,846, Loktantrik Samajwadi Party (LSP) 4,225 and Maoist Center 3,256.
Upendra Yadav also has the support of NC, LSP and Maoist Center as the common candidate of the ruling coalition which together secured 31,902 PR votes in November. He also has the support of Ram Kishore Yadav, who secured 11,043 votes contesting as an independent candidate after quitting JSP in Bara-2, and Rabindra Prasad Yadav, who secured 10,750 votes contesting as a rebel NC candidate.
But Upendra Yadav seems to be trailing Kushwaha despite all that. The main reason for that is that Upendra Yadav is not contesting Kushwaha but Raut, who had defeated him in Saptari, in what appears to be a rematch of that November contest.
Many of the voters Setopati talked to said that Raut and Upendra Yadav are set for a close fight despite Raut not contesting the election. Raut’s magic seems to work the most on youths, women, impoverished people and Dalits.
Aware that defeating Upendra Yadav again in Bara-2 will establish him as the most prominent leader in Madhes, Raut has been staying in Bara in recent times. He has visited all the wards in the constituency, had tea with the voters and talked with them sharing their woes and happiness.
Upendra Yadav has also been based in the constituency but the contrast between him and Raut cannot be starker. Yadav visits with a motorcade and communicating directly with the voters has never been the forte of Yadav, who can neither talk with his eyes or laugh with gay abandon. Many voters complain that he does not listen to their grievances.
Yadav also suffers from the disadvantage of trying to again become HoR member through the backdoor just five months after that resounding defeat in Saptari by engineering the election of his confidant Ram Sahay Prasad Yadav as the country’s vice-president. Many point that he should have exercised patience and waited for five years.
He has always faced the accusation of continuously changing his constituency.
Yadav—who had lost to NC’s Girija Prasad Koirala in Sunsari-5 on a UML ticket in the first parliamentary election after restoration of democracy in 1990 and later joined the Maoist party—rose as the messiah of Madhes following the Madhes Movement triggered by him torching the Interim Constitution at the Maitighar Mandala just a day after it was promulgated on January 15, 2007, as founder of a political advocacy movement named Madhesi Janadhikar Forum.
The next Madhes Movement forced Koirala to sign an agreement accepting federalism. Yadav turned his organization into a political party and emerged as the fourth largest party after Maoists, NC and UML following the First Constituent Assembly (CA) Election in 2008. He was elected to the First Constituent Assembly (CA) Election in 2008 from both Morang and Sunsari districts.
He lost from Morang and won in Sunsari in the Second CA Election in 2013. He contested from Saptari-2, which includes Mahadeva Rural Municipality where he was born, in 2017 in search of a safe seat. But he lost to Raut even in that safe constituency in the recent election.
He has now taken his caravan to Bara-2 and suffers from the same malaise that took him down in Saptari. Many voters complain that he has not done anything for the people of Madhes despite continuously becoming lawmaker and minister in the past 15 years and used politics as a means to get into the government.
The fact that Raut roped in Kushwaha from Maoist Center to defeat Upendra Yadav also seems to be working against Yadav with the Janamat Party candidate looking set to add a few votes on his own on top of all those he looks set to amass owing to the charisma and popularity of Raut.
Upendra Yadav also looks set to struggle to attract all the votes from the second largest party in the constituency, NC, despite the grand old party officially supporting him. He will have to attract as many NC votes as he can if he were to register a narrow win over Kushwaha.

The Cabinet has revoked the decision to hand over the contract of authenticating personal and biological details of citizens acquiring the national identity card to a foreign company.
Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) President Rabi Lamichhane had awarded the contract to Advantage International through fast track when he was the home minister. The Cabinet meeting on Monday has revoked the decision, according to a minister.
The decision has been revoked as the Home Ministry did not consult and seek permission from the Law Ministry and the Finance Ministry while awarding the contract, and it was not awarded as per the laws and regulations, according to the minister.
“Everything should be considered while handing over responsibility for a sensitive issue related to the national security to a foreign company but that was not found to have been done. That decision has been revoked as the Law Ministry and the Finance Ministry were not consulted and the laws were not followed apart from that.”
The minister added that the issued would also be investigated.
Lamichhane had issued a working procedure allowing invitation of bids for the contract giving a seven-day deadline just two days after being sworn in as home minister which is against Clause 14 of the Public Procurement Act which requires a 45-day deadline while inviting bids for an international tender. The law requires 15-day extension at first and then a seven-day extension if no bids are received during the period.
The company was awarded the contract on January 26. The Supreme Court (SC) the next day had ruled that Lamichhane was ineligible to become a lawmaker as he did not complete the process to re-acquire his citizenship certificate that became invalid after he acquired US citizenship. Lamichhane had resigned as deputy prime minister and home minister the same day.

Hearing on the writ petition filed against the Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC)’s refusal to collect garbage from the Singha Durbar, President’s Office, ministers’ quarters and other places could not be held Tuesday.
A single bench of Justice Hari Krishna Karki was assigned to conduct a preliminary hearing on the petition filed by advocate Padam Shrestha at the Supreme Court (SC). But the bench did not find time to hear the petition.
The petition, which was registered on Monday, has demanded that the Supreme Court order KMC to collect garbage from the Singha Durbar and other places. It says that KMC cannot shirk its responsibility of collecting garbage.
The petition has also made Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and the Council of Ministers defendants, stating that the central and local governments have not worked in coordination with each other as they should.
It has already been 10 days since KMC stopped collecting garbage from the Singha Durbar and other places.
KMC spokesperson Navin Manandhar said that the garbage will be collected only after talks with the government.
According to a KMC officer, Mayor Balen Shah is ready to hold talks on the issue only at the prime minister’s level.
“Meetings and talks have been held with different ministers for nine months, he [Shah] is insisting on holding talks with the prime minister himself rather than with ministers now,” the officer said. “He is adamant that the issues should be decided at the prime minister’s level as ministers keep changing and it would be no use talking only to them.”

He lost from Morang and won in Sunsari in the Second CA Election in 2013. He contested from Saptari-2, which includes Mahadeva Rural Municipality where he was born, in 2017 in search of a safe seat. But he lost to Raut even in that safe constituency in the recent election.
He has now taken his caravan to Bara-2 and suffers from the same malaise that took him down in Saptari. Many voters complain that he has not done anything for the people of Madhes despite continuously becoming lawmaker and minister in the past 15 years and used politics as a means to get into the government.
The fact that Raut roped in Kushwaha from Maoist Center to defeat Upendra Yadav also seems to be working against Yadav with the Janamat Party candidate looking set to add a few votes on his own on top of all those he looks set to amass owing to the charisma and popularity of Raut.
Upendra Yadav also looks set to struggle to attract all the votes from the second largest party in the constituency, NC, despite the grand old party officially supporting him. He will have to attract as many NC votes as he can if he were to register a narrow win over Kushwaha.

Garbage at the Singha Durbar, the Shital Niwas and residence of the prime minister remain unpicked for the sixth day on instruction of Mayor of Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) Balen Shah.
Manager of Paribartan Nepal, that picks garbage from the Singha Durbar, Mitra Ghimire told Setopati that garbage remained unpicked even on Friday due to instruction of Mayor Shah. “We cannot pick garbage until instructed by the KMC to do so,” Ghimire stated.
“Garbage of Singha Durbar will not be picked from today. Leaders there will have to be dumped at Sisdole if the country really has to be cleaned,” Shah had posted on Facebook Saturday to inform about stopping garbage collection.
Taking to Facebook again on Monday Shah blamed the federal government for lack of coordination with the local government despite his continuous efforts for nine months. “The conclusion until now of the disregard, irresponsibility and negligence toward the repeated efforts made is the decision to not collect garbage from the Singha Durbar,” Shah has posted.
KMC Spokesperson Navin Manandhar told Setopati that garbage would not be picked from the Singha Durbar until the federal government summons the KMC for dialogue.
The federal government took exception to Shah’s expression to ‘dump at Sisdole’ and act of stopping garbage collection from the Singha Durbar, and decided to seriously draw his attention to that.
Taking to the social media again on Thursday, Shah stated that Kathmanduites would not have any problem even if the federal capital or the Singha Durbar were shifted from Kathmandu.
“Either you work for the interest of Kathmandu or shift Singha Durbar to another local body. We Kathmanduites don’t have any problem whether you shift Singha Durbar or capital,” Shah posted.

Govinda Raj Joshi and his son Deepak Raj have held talks with Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) President Rabi Lamichhane and other leaders.
Joshi’s father-son duo met with Lamichhane and other RSP leaders at Siddhartha Hotel along the Prithvi Highway in Chumlingtar, Chitwan on Thursday morning.
An RSP central member told Setopati that they held talks on the April 23 by-election and other matters with Joshi’s group.
“They have given word for unconditional support to our candidate Swarnim Wagle in Tanahun-1 in the by-election,” the RSP central member said.
Joshi is a former joint general secretary of Nepali Congress (NC). The party had taken disciplinary action against him four years ago after he was accused of playing a role in NC candidate Ram Chandra Paudel’s defeat in Tanahun-1 in the 2017 general election. NC, however, withdrew its disciplinary action against Joshi on April 2.
NC President Sher Bahadur Deuba then held talks with Joshi’s son Deepak Raj at Dhumbarahi and suggested that they should join hands and move ahead together.
But Joshi, issuing a statement on Wednesday, announced that talks with NC have ended for this phase. He accused NC of dillydallying and ambiguous talk.
Joshi’s meeting with RSP leaders comes on the heels of failed talks with NC.
RSP has fielded Wagle as its candidate for the April 23 by-election in Tanahun-1.
Joshi himself had contested the November 20 general election from Tanahun-1. He received 6,878 votes but lost to Ram Chandra Paudel.
Joshi’s group has not fielded any candidate for the by-election. Expelled NC leaders are still active in politics in Tanahun calling themselves NC (Independent Group) and NC (BP Society), and still use the flag of NC.
Deepak Raj had run for mayor of Vyas Municipality in last year’s local election. CPN-UML had also supported him. He received 11,826 votes.
Deepak Raj claimed that they did not talk about the by-election during the meeting with the RSP group led by Lamichhane.
“Swarnim is a friend, we met as friends,” Deepak Raj said. “There wasn’t really much talk about the by-election.”
He said that they have even issued a statement urging Tanahun’s voters to use their discretion when casting their ballots.
“We haven’t fielded our official candidate. We are independent in Tanahun as we are not members of any particular party,” the statement says. “We also urge our well-wishers to vote and elect a candidate who is capable, intellectual and who can uphold Tanahun’s prestige in Nepali politics.”
NC has fielded Govinda Bhattarai in Tanahun-1 while UML has fielded Sarbendra Khanal.

Taking to Facebook a day after he unilaterally stopped collection of garbage from the Singha Durbar, Shah blamed the federal government for lack of coordination with the local government despite his continuous efforts for nine months. “The conclusion until now of the disregard, irresponsibility and negligence toward the repeated efforts made is the decision to not collect garbage from the Singha Durbar,” Shah posted.
He urged the federal government to untie the knots for resolution of the local problems at the local level.
“How can we say that the government that does not listen to the another government and people’s representatives, and understand and prioritize (their problems) accept the existence of one another? How can we say that the federal government is for strengthening federalism?”
He also listed how the efforts he has made to coordinate with 14 different federal ministries to resolve problems including management of squatters, traffic lights, footpath encroached by diplomatic missions, hospitals, expansion of the Ring Road, street lights and others have failed to yield results due to apathy of the federal government.
Garbage was not collected even from the residence of the president, the prime minister and the federal ministers on Sunday.
Shah did not discuss the issue with other elected representatives or KMC staffers and took the decision unilaterally.
An organization named Paribartan Nepal collects garbage from the Singha Durbar and Manager of the organization Mitra Ghimire told Setopati that Mayor Shah instructed the body to not collect garbage.

The decision of Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) to replace Dhaka Kumar Shrestha, who was elected to the House of Representatives (HoR) through the Proportional Representation electoral system, with Bindabasini Kansakar has created grievances in the party.
Central member Megh Ale has expressed disappointment pointing that his name is below that of Shrestha in the indigenous male cluster of the closed list for PR lawmakers sent by the party to the Election Commission before the general election.
The party formed by Rabi Lamichhane just before the election had held voting among its central members to determine ranking of the leaders in the PR list.
“I will struggle within the party. But the party appears to be doing good in the mindset of the people. We will move forward in agreement in the election environment,” Ale told Setopati.
When asked if he will lodge a complaint with the Election Commission he stated, “I will try to understand what the issue is. But there is no talk about complaining.”
The party’s central committee meeting held on Wednesday decided to punish Shrestha after audio recording of him purportedly demanding Rs 20 million from promoter of B&C Medical College Durga Prasai was made public and send acid attack victim Bindabasini Kansakar as HoR member through the PR electoral system to replace Shrestha.
Kapurbot Media on Sunday had published audio recording of what it claims is the deal between Shrestha and Prasai.
Shrestha can be heard telling Prasai that the amount was needed to give to RSP President Rabi Lamichhane’s men for Shrestha to become health minister.
The conversation took place at the start of January, as Prasai informs in the audio, when RSP was negotiating in the then ruling coalition also including CPN-UML to get the Health Ministry. Shrestha can be heard telling Prasai that Lamichhane would make him heath minister only if he hands over Rs 20-25 million to Lamichhane's men.

The party’s central committee meeting held on Wednesday has decided to punish Shrestha after audio recording of him purportedly demanding Rs 20 million from promoter of B&C Medical College Durga Prasai was made public.
Talking to reporters after the meeting RSP President Lamichhane said that Shrestha was removed after finding enough grounds to punish him despite him denying that the voice on the audio was not his.

Shrestha can be heard telling Prasai that Lamichhane would make him heath minister only if he hands over Rs 20-25 million to Lamichhane's men.
Lamichhane also revealed that Shrestha threatened the party’s discipline committee to finish RSP if he were punished. “He has been repeatedly changing his version. His guilt was proven also because the audio was recorded in January. He was allowed to present his version (in the party) repeatedly,” Lamichhane stated. “He also wished that he were not removed but also warned that he would show the party if he were punished.”
He claimed that he did not know who Shrestha was referring to as his men in the ‘core team’ in the audio recording. “Why not punish if facts are uncovered about the core team? He has now come to one level of bargaining. What should be known is we will assist the CIAA,” Lamichhane stressed.
Lamichhane added that Shrestha had the option of appealing with the party if he were not satisfied with the decision to punish him.
The party had suspended Shrestha immediately after the audio recording was made public and instructed the central discipline and conduct committee to investigate facts about the telephone conversation and submit the report to the central committee within three days.

The Home Ministry has increased surveillance of activities of medical entrepreneur Durga Prasai.
Prasai—who has recently started a campaign to save nation, nationalism, religion, culture, and citizens—has also been organizing different programs accusing banks and financial institutions of excesses.
“We have been observing activities of Durga Prasai. All the bodies routinely carry out political and economic analysis and not just observe him. We will bring to book of there is obstruction in public service, and citizens are hassled,” Information Officer with the Home Ministry Dil Kumar Tamang told Setopati.
The Prasai-led campaign has started the campaign of smearing soot on staffers of banks and financial institutions for their ‘excesses’ from Chitwan. Coordinator of the campaign Shambhu Thapa was arrested by Chitwan Police Wednesday morning for vitiating public environment by spreading rumors in the society through unnatural and demeaning remarks.
Thapa, former Chitwan chief of the Maoist youth wing Young Communist League (YCL), is under investigation and the police will decide on the type of case to be filed against him after investigation.
Different organizations of commercial and development banks, and financial and micro-finance institutions had handed over memorandum letter to the Home Ministry demanding security guarantee after Prasai started the campaign of smearing soot. The Home Ministry on March 3 then instructed all 77 district police offices to provide security to staffers of banks and financial institutions, and stop such incidents of misbehavior.
“Those violating laws, taking the laws into hands and carrying out prohibited activities in the name of campaign will be arrested. They won’t be arrested for merely joining the campaign though,” Tamang stated.
He said Thapa may have been arrested as per the Home Ministry’s instruction, and added that case can be filed against Thapa by the police itself if there are no complaints against him.
Prasai, who is close to CPN-UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli who has nominated him as central member of the party, was expelled from the party on February 25 after he started a political campaign along with former king Gyanendra Shah and his son Paras on February 13.

The girl had not been able to tell anyone about her rape by Chataut for a long time. She had fled from the home she was living in seeking protection from the state. But she appeared to have turned hostile, changing her statement while testifying in court, after the police, the National Child Rights Council, the DGAO and the court did not give her protection.

Summit Hotel and Apartment has been found to have started construction without passing its design map and completing environmental impact assessment (EIA).
The project caught attention when surrounding houses subsided early Saturday morning due to construction works at the project site.
The project is constructing a 16-story building in the name of The Summit Hotel and Residences that will have a five-star hotel with 130 rooms and 160 units of luxury apartments with investment of over Rs 6 billion, according to the management.
Three business houses jointly own the project with Amrit Raj Shakya, owner of the old Summit Hotel, owning 40 percent stake, Chaudhary Group owned by Nepali Congress (NC) lawmaker Binod Chaudhary 30 percent, and NE Group led by former chairman of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry and former minister Ravi Bhakta Shrestha the remaining 30 percent.
Ravi Bhakta Shrestha is chairman of the project while Sanchit Shrestha is the project director. The Shresthas refused to talk with Setopati despite repeated efforts.
The project issued a statement in the name of project director Shrestha on Monday and promised that ‘further works would be done as per the agreement with the locals in presence of the people’s representatives’ while the Chaudhary Group also issued a separate statement pointing that it only had less than one-third stake in the project and was not involved in project management.
Commissioner for Lalitpur district of the Kathmandu Valley Development Authority (KVDA) Safal Shrestha confirmed with Setopati that the project had started construction without passing the map and completing EIA.
He revealed that the project had applied for passing the map on February 22, 2022 but it was delayed in lack of adequate documents. “They apparently had started construction works without receiving permission.”
He stressed that the KVDA had even written to the project in September 2022 to stop construction after complaints that it started construction. He added that the documents have been provided now by the project but decision to grant permission can be taken only by the board meeting and has yet to be taken.
The Lalitpur Metropolitan City (LMC), meanwhile, has said that Summit Hotel and Apartment will face stringent punishment for violating the laws. Construction at the site has already been stopped. “We will stop construction of the hotel if a hotel cannot be constructed there,” Deputy Mayor Manjali Shakya Bajracharya told Setopati.
She pointed that a probe committee had already been formed and the process to take action against the developers would start only after the committee submits its report.
Another committee under Deputy Mayor Bajracharya, and including chairs of Wards 1 and 2 and officer from the Lalitpur District Administration Office, representatives from the developers and the affected persons, has also been formed to resolve the problems of the affected individuals.
She revealed that the affected persons were shifted from there and Summit will have to bear all the expenses for relocating them, providing accommodation to them and reconstruction of the damaged houses.
A meeting at the LMC on Sunday had also decided to immediately form a fund of Rs 10 million to address the problems faced by the affected persons.

The Kathmandu District Court has ordered two government witnesses to appear in court to testify in the rape case against Sandeep Lamichhane.
A bench of Judge Shankar Raj Baral on Sunday issued an order to produce two government witnesses in the case.
According to Lamichhane’s lawyer Murari Sapkota, the court issued the order as the prosecution had applied for an order to produce two witnesses in court stating that their statements had not been recorded.
The case against Lamichhane is set for a final hearing as per the Supreme Court order on February 27 to conclude the case through fast track.
On September 6, 2022, a girl had lodged a rape complaint against Lamichhane with the Gaushal Police Circle.
Lamichhane, then captain of the national cricket team, was in the West Indies to play the Caribbean Premier League when the rape complaint was filed.
Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) had suspended Lamichhane after a case was filed against him.
Nepal Police had issued a diffusion notice through Interpol on September 26 when Lamichhane did not return to Nepal from the West Indies.
Lamichhane eventually returned to Nepal on October 6 and was arrested upon landing at the Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu.
After the preliminary hearing on the case, the Kathmandu District Court on November 4 had issued an order to send Lamichhane to judicial custody.
Lamichhane had appealed against the order at the Patan High Court. On January 12, the Patan High Court had ordered Lamichhane’s release on a bail of Rs 2 million and on certain conditions.
As per the conditions set by the court, Lamichhane could not travel abroad, was required to inform the police if he had to travel outside the Kathmandu Valley, and could not contact the girl directly or indirectly.
Lamichhane and the Office of the Auditor General (OAG) had then moved the Supreme Court against the High Court’s order. Lamichhane had filed a writ petition at the apex court demanding that he be allowed to travel abroad to play cricket, while the OAG had filed a separate petition demanding that Lamichhane be kept in judicial custody during his trial.
Hearing both petitions on February 27, the Supreme Court had upheld the Patan High Court’s order to release Lamichhane on bail and also allowed Lamichhane to travel abroad to play cricket. The court had also ordered that the case be decided through fast track.

The Kathmandu District Court will hear the rape case of cricketer Sandeep Lamichhane on Sunday.
The bench of Judge Shankar Raj Baral is scheduled to hear the case on Sunday. The bench of Judge Keshav Prasad Ghimire was scheduled to hear the case on April 5 but it did not find time to hear it that day.
The previous hearing on the case scheduled for March 27 was also stopped after Lamichhane applied for stopping the hearing.
Judge Madhav Ghimire, who had refused to grant bail to Lamichhane and sent him to judicial custody, was scheduled to hear the case that day.
The Patan High Court later had granted bail to Lamichhane.
The joint bench of Judges Dhruba Raj Nanda and Ramesh Dhakal hearing on the appeal against the Kathmandu District Court’s order to send Lamichhane to judicial custody in the case of raping a minor on January 12 decided to revoke the Kathmandu District Court’s order citing lack of grounds to keep him in custody. He was released on a bail of Rs 2 million the next day.
The Patan High Court while granting Lamichhane bail had put five conditions including prohibiting him from going abroad.
The Office of the Attorney General (OAG) had appealed with the Supreme Court (SC) against the Patan High Court’s order to release him on a bail of Rs 2 million. The OAG in its appeal has argued that the Patan High Court’s order to release Lamichhane on bail is against legal provisions and the SC’s interpretation during bail hearing in cases of similar nature.
Clause 27 of the National Criminal Procedure (Code) Act, 2017 has clear provision for holding the accused of any offense which is punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding three years in detention if based on the evidence available the accused appears to be guilty of the offense or there is any reasonable ground, based on such evidence, to believe that such person is guilty of the offense.
But Lamichhane was released on bail despite sub-section 3 (d) of Section 219 of the National Penal (Code) Act, 2017 stating that a person who commits rape shall be liable to imprisonment for a term of 10 to 12 years if the woman is 16 or above 16 years of age but below 18 years of age. The victim in the case is 17 years.
Lamichhane had also moved the SC demanding he be allowed to travel with the national team going to the UAE to play ICC Men's Cricket World Cup League 2 matches against the UAE and Papua New Guinea at the end of February.
The joint bench of Justices Sapana Pradhan Malla and Kumar Chudal after conducting a joint hearing of the petition by Lamichhane and the OAG’s appeal had ordered on February 27 to allow Lamichhane to go to the UAE.
The District Government Attorney’s Office (DGAO), Kathmandu had registered a case against Lamichhane charging him with raping a minor.
The District Police Range, Kathmandu and the Metropolitan Police Circle, Gaushala had submitted the investigation report at the DGAO on October 21 after completing their joint investigation against Lamichhane. However, a case could not be filed against him then due to the Tihar holidays.
Police had investigated against Lamichhane under Section 219 of the National Penal (Code) Act, 2017 after a 17-year-old girl filed a rape complaint against him.
The Kathmandu DGAO has demanded a prison sentence of up to 12 years against Lamichhane as per sub-section 3 (d) of Section 219, which states that a person who commits rape shall be liable to imprisonment for a term of 10 to 12 years if the woman is 16 or above 16 years of age but below 18 years of age. It has also sought compensation for the victim.
Lamichhane has denied the rape allegation in his statements to the DGAO and police. He has admitted to staying with the girl in the same room of a hotel in Kathmandu on August 21. But he has said that the girl had slept on the bed and he had slept on a chair that night.
Lamichhane, who is the former captain of the Nepal cricket team, has been accused of raping a minor multiple times in a hotel room in Kathmandu on August 21.
A 17-year-old girl filed a rape complaint against Lamichhane at the Gaushala Police Circle on September 6.
The girl has complained that Lamichhane took her out to different places of Bhaktapur and Kathmandu on August 21, a day before Lamichhane left for the bilateral series with Kenya.
She has accused Lamichhane of raping her multiple times in room number 305 of a hotel in Kathmandu Metropolitan City Ward Number 9 that night.
Police have also collected CCTV footage of the night from the hotel. The footage shows that Lamichhane had stayed at the hotel for seven hours.
The girl has claimed in her complaint that she had gone to Nagarkot with Lamichhane on August 17 after being introduced to him through a friend.
Lamichhane left to play in the Caribbean Premier League on August 22 after leading the team to a 3-2 victory in the five-match Twenty20 series against Kenya. Rohit Kumar Paudel then led the Nepali team in the one-dayers in his absence.
An arrest warrant was issued against Lamichhane on September 8 and the Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) suspended him from the national team the same day after issuance of the arrest warrant.
Nepal Police later also issued a diffusion notice against him through Interpol on September 26.
Section 219 (2) of the National Penal (Code) Act, 2017 states: “Where a man has sexual intercourse with a woman without her consent or with a girl child below eighteen years of age even with her consent, the man shall be considered to commit rape on such woman or girl child.”

                            The government has stepped back from the decision to host the International Indian Film Academy (IIFA) Awards in Kathmandu.
Deepak Raj Joshi, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Nepal Tourism Board (NTB) that has been handed responsibility to coordinate the hosting of event, told Setopati that it has decided to immediately stop all preparations.
The International Relations Committee of the parliament has already instructed the government to not host the event. CEO Joshi said preparations will be stopped due to that instruction and in respect of public sentiments. ""We had taken the event as an opportunity for tourism promotion and branding. But we have decided to stop it feeling it is not the appropriate time to host the event due to the instruction of parliamentary committee and other political and social reasons,"" he added.
Minister for Communication and Information Technology Gokul Baskota during the weekly press conference on Thursday had said the event will be hosted in a way that the NTB and the Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) are joint co-organizers. The event was scheduled for the last week of August.
The government had formed a high level committee under Minister of State for Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation Dhan Bahadur Buda.
The event would have cost the government almost Rs 1 billion. The organizers had demanded US$ 4 million from Nepal for getting to organize the event while Nepal would also have to provide air fares, accommodation and local transportation for the guests and participants, the majority of whom demanded business class tickets and five-star accommodation.
The government's decision was widely criticized after revelation that the event will be hosted with taxpayers' money.

The organizers have demanded US$ 4 million from Nepal for getting to organize the event, according to Nepal Tourism Board (NTB) CEO Deepak Raj Joshi.
The Cabinet has decided to organize the event in Nepal with NTB and Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) the joint co-organizers.
Coordinator of the Visit Nepal Year Suraj Vaidya and Joshi have been handed the responsibility to negotiate with the organizers about the event fee. ""We are in course of discussion. We have only held discussions on the venue and guests but have yet to sign agreement. We have yet to finalize event fee as well,"" Joshi told Setopati.
Joshi revealed that the organizers have demanded the amount for technical preparations including event management to fees for the artistes. But both the NTB and KMC do not have working procedure to pay a foreign company in such manner.
A member of the high-level committee formed by the government to organize the event confided that additional Rs 200 million will be needed for air fares, accommodation and local transportation for the guests and participants. ""The majority of them have demanded business class tickets while they will also want five-star hotels. Another Rs 200 million will have to be spent in that,"" the member told Setopati.
Millions will also have to be spent on security for the guests and awards taking the expenditure to almost Rs 1 billion.
NTB CEO Joshi, however, claimed that the money will be well-spent providing unprecedented promotion for Nepal. ""This is an event with a viewership greater than that of Oscars. This will create a brand for the city. We can also send a message that we are capable and safe to organize such huge events,"" he reasoned. ""They will name the event Nepal IIFA and many television channels will promote the event as Nepal IIFA.""
He said the event will also provide an opportunity to bring multiple stars. ""We have to spend around Rs 50 million to bring one star now. Around 100 stars of that level will arrive for the event. Videos about Nepali destinations will also be played during the event. We have almost agreed on that. Such videos will be useful for us even in the future.""

Video shows the former California governor standing and filming children at a sporting event in Johannesburg when a man makes a flying kick into his back. Schwarzenegger stumbles forward. The man is quickly grabbed by security. Off camera a man shouts several times “Help me!”

The video shortly afterward shows Schwarzenegger smiling and shaking hands with bystanders before walking out ringed by security.

Schwarzenegger later posted on Twitter: “Thanks for your concerns, but there is nothing to worry about. I thought I was just jostled by the crowd, which happens a lot. I only realized I was kicked when I saw the video like all of you. I’m just glad the idiot didn’t interrupt my Snapchat.”

Schwarzenegger also tweeted a second video of the incident “without whatever he was yelling so he doesn’t get the spotlight.”

“By the way...” he joked, “block or charge?”

Schwarzenegger had been attending his Arnold Classic Africa event, which features dozens of sports and fitness activities. In a separate Twitter post, the event blamed a “crazed fan” for the assault.

The statement cited organizer Wayne Price as saying the assailant was “known to the police for orchestrating similar incidents in the past” and that Schwarzenegger was “fine and still in good spirits.”

The actor confirmed he had no intention of pursuing charges and would continue with another appearance on Sunday as planned, the statement said.

                            Mother’s Day is in a couple weeks, but Drake gave his mom an early gift with a heartfelt speech at the 2019 Billboard Music Awards, where the rap star also broke Taylor Swift’s record for most wins.

Drake turned up the love for his mom when he picked up top artist, besting Cardi B, Ariana Grande, Post Malone and Travis Scott. He won 12 awards Wednesday in Las Vegas, making his career total 27 (Swift has 23 wins).

He looked up to the ceiling as he held the trophy, then said: “I just want to thank my mom for her relentless effort in my life.

“I want to thank my mom for all the times you drove me to piano. All the times you drove me to basketball and hockey — that clearly didn’t work out. All the times you drove me to ‘Degrassi.’ No matter how long it took me to figure out what I wanted to do, you were always there to give me a ride, and now we’re on one hell of ride,” Drake said.

Family bonding was a theme at the three-hour show, which aired live on NBC and was hosted by Kelly Clarkson

Ciara’s young son and husband, NFL player Russell Wilson, danced along while she worked the stage, and Nick and Joe Jonas gave kisses to Priyanka Chopra and Sophie Turner of “Game of Thrones” fame when they sang in the audience before hitting the stage. Brendon Urie of Panic! at the Disco looked to his parents as he accepted top rock song, quoting the name of his current hit: “Hey look Ma, I made it!”

Mariah Carey’s twins cheered her on as she sang a medley of her hits and accepted the Icon award. She was in diva form before taking the award from Jennifer Hudson, throwing her napkin on the floor after dabbing her face with it.

“Without getting into all the drama, all the ups and downs of my career ... I guess I always felt like an outsider, someone who doesn’t quite belong anywhere, and I still feel like that lost interracial child who had a lot of nerve to believe I could succeed at anything at all in this world. But, and this is the truth, I did believe because I had to,” she said. “The truth is I dedicated my life to my music — my saving grace — and to my fans.”

Cardi B, the night’s top nominee with 21, locked lips with husband Offset on the red carpet and the couple sat closely inside the venue. She won six awards, including top Hot 100 song for “Girls Like You” with Maroon 5.

“I remember when Maroon 5 hit me up to do this song. I was like, ‘Bro I’m five months pregnant. I can’t even breathe.’ But this record to me was so amazing. I was like, ‘Oh this is going to be a hit.’ And now I sing this song to my daughter because she’s the girl that I need,” she said.

Drake and Cardi B — who both won multiple awards during the live telecast — used their speeches to promote love and appreciation for their peers in the music industry.

Others, too, brought on the positive energy when onstage. Imagine Dragons’ band leader Dan Reynolds used his speech to highlight the dangers of conversion therapy on LGBTQ youth. He earned rousing applause. Florida Georgia Line’s Tyler Hubbard followed suit, telling the audience after winning top country song: “In the spirit of so much truth being spoken tonight by so many talented artists, I think we should speak some truth.”

“As artists we all get to experience so many unbelievable things, but in our opinion, at the end of the day, it’s all for nothing if you’re not using your platform for better ... to spread love, to help those in needs, to be a light to your community,” he said.

Swift kicked off the show when she brought her new music video to life with a colorful, eye-popping performance of her song “ME!” Dancers wearing bright, pastel colors spun in the air holding umbrellas and a marching band kicked off Swift’s performance — like most of the world, maybe she was inspired by Beyonce’s new Coachella film?

Madonna, wearing an eye-patch, teamed up with Colombian singer Maluma for a performance, but it was Grammy-winning Christian artist Lauren Daigle who had the night’s best performance. She sang “You Say,” giving the audience a calm, yet strong and powerful performance. She was backed by three awesome background singers and a pianist.

BTS, who performed alongside Halsey, also had a major night. At the Billboard Awards and American Music Awards, the K-pop band had only previously won “social” awards based off their fanatic fan base, but on Wednesday BTS picked up top duo/group, besting Grammy-winning groups like Maroon 5, Imagine Dragons and Dan + Shay.

“I still can’t believe we’re here on this stage with so many great artists,” RM said as fans screamed loudly. “We’re still the same boys from six years ago, we still have the same dreams ... we still have the same thoughts. Let us keep dreaming.”

An unlikely winner at the Billboard Awards? “Game of Thrones” actress Maisie Williams, whose plays Arya Stark on the HBO series and shined brightly on last week’s episode.

“Shout-out to Arya Stark for putting in that work last week,” Drake said onstage after winning his first award of the evening.

                            Adele and her husband Simon Konecki have separated.

The pop singer’s representatives Benny Tarantini and Carl Fysh confirmed the news Friday in a statement to The Associated Press.

“Adele and her partner have separated,” the emailed statement said. “They are committed to raising their son together lovingly. As always they ask for privacy. There will be no further comment.”

Adele gave birth to their son, Angelo, in 2012.

The Grammy-winning British superstar has been private about her relationship, but confirmed she married Konecki when she won album of the year at the 2017 Grammys. In her acceptance speech, she said: “Grammys, I appreciate it. The Academy, I love you. My manager, my husband and my son — you’re the only reason I do it.”

Konecki co-founded Life Water, an eco-friendly brand of bottled water in the U.K. Funds from the company assists the charity that Konecki runs, Drop4Drop, which provides clean water to countries in need.

A representative for Konecki could not be reached.

                            Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt are officially single, though more work is left before the terms of their divorce are final.

Los Angeles Superior Court documents show that Judge John W. Ouderkirk entered a judgment Friday, saying the couple is no longer married. Her name was also restored to just Jolie, not Jolie Pitt.

The couple’s lawyers had asked for a bifurcated judgment, meaning that two married people can be declared single before all issues in the divorce are agreed upon.

It’s not clear what issues remain unresolved in the divorce, but Jolie has filed papers saying Pitt wasn’t paying sufficient child support, which his attorneys disputed.

The 43-year-old Jolie and the 55-year-old Pitt have six children. They were married in 2014, and Jolie filed for divorce in 2016.

                            Actress Amber Heard asked a judge Thursday to dismiss a $50 million defamation lawsuit her ex-husband Johnny Depp filed over an op-ed about domestic violence she wrote in The Washington Post, and provided new evidence toward her allegations of abuse.

In the motion filed in the Circuit Court of Fairfax, Virginia, Heard describes in new detail more than a dozen instances before and during their marriage when she says Depp slapped her, shoved her, pulled her hair or choked her. Depp has denied any such abuse. The allegations have appeared in the couple’s divorce and other legal fights.

Heard includes exhibits such as photos of her with bruises on her face and scars on her arms, images of damage she says Depp did to their home, and newly revealed screenshots of text messages describing the incidents at the time, and excerpts of her divorce deposition describing domestic abuse.

“Johnny Depp physically and verbally abused Amber Heard,” her attorney Eric George said in a statement. “Since their divorce, Mr. Depp has continued to publically harass Ms. Heard, and attempted to gaslight the world by denying his abuse. It is long past time for Mr. Depp’s despicable conduct to end.”

Depp’s lawsuit, filed last month, called the ongoing allegations of domestic abuse “categorically and demonstrably false.”

“They were part of an elaborate hoax to generate positive publicity for Ms. Heard and advance her career,” the lawsuit states, claiming that “she is the perpetrator.”

Depp’s attorney, Adam Waldman, said he was reviewing the new filing. He said previously that he and Depp looked forward to providing evidence that would clear Depp’s name.

The Post piece by Heard, published in December, does not mention Depp by name or describe any incidents, but it discusses the societal plight of those who speak up about domestic abuse.

“I spoke up against sexual violence — and faced our culture’s wrath,” the 32-year-old actress wrote, adding that she felt as though she was “on trial in the court of public opinion.”

But Depp’s lawsuit says it was clear Heard was talking about him, and that it worsened the damage the allegations had already done to his career.

The lawsuit states Depp, 55, has suffered financial losses because of the accusations, including being dropped from his role as Capt. Jack Sparrow in the “Pirates of the Caribbean” films.

Heard’s lawyers also argued that the lawsuit should be moved to Los Angeles because that’s where the relevant events took place and the court would be in a position to subpoena witnesses and find facts.

Heard first accused Depp of domestic violence in May 2016, the year after they were married. They were divorced in 2017.

The actress, whose credits include “Aquaman” and “Justice League,” met Depp on the set of their 2011 film “The Rum Diary.”

The couple posted an Instagram photo of their hands with a massive engagement ring on Lopez’s ring finger. The former Yankees shortstop captioned his photo with “she said yes” and a heart emoji.

The couple has been dating since early 2017 and later that year landed on the cover of Vanity Fair magazine with their celebrity couple nickname, J-Rod.

In January, Rodriguez told The Associated Press that he and Lopez had similar backgrounds and her latest film “Second Act” reflected the ties that drew them together.

“It really resembles a lot of the arc that Jennifer and I lived in our life: Both born in New York, both come from immigrant parents, both have two children, both Latino Americano — her from Puerto Rico, me from Dominican Republic. We’ve been through our ups and downs, but here we are in our 40s and trying to live the best lives possible and, at the same time, give back and pay it forward,” Rodriguez said.

It will be Lopez’s fourth marriage and Rodriguez’s second. Each has two children from previous marriages.

                            Actor Johnny Depp is suing his ex-wife, actress Amber Heard, in a $50 million defamation lawsuit, citing a piece she wrote for The Washington Post about domestic abuse.

The complaint, filed Friday in the Circuit Court of Fairfax, Virginia, said that, while Depp was not named in the Post article, it was clear Heard was talking about him. The lawsuit called her ongoing allegations of domestic abuse “categorically and demonstrably false.”

“They were part of an elaborate hoax to generate positive publicity for Ms. Heard and advance her career,” the lawsuit said, claiming that “she is the perpetrator.”

The suit said Depp, 55, has suffered financial losses because of the accusations, including being dropped from his role as Capt. Jack Sparrow in the “Pirates of the Caribbean” films.

In her article, published in the Post in December, Heard also said she lost an acting role and contract with a major fashion brand because went public with her claims of abuse.

“I spoke up against sexual violence — and faced our culture’s wrath,” the 32-year-old actress wrote, adding that she felt as those she was “on trial in the court of public opinion.”

Heard’s publicists and attorney did not return phone calls or emails from The Associated Press seeking comment on Saturday.

In a statement to People magazine, her attorney Eric M. George called the lawsuit “frivolous” and “just the latest of Johnny Depp’s repeated efforts to silence Amber Heard.”

                            Billy Porter, speaking to Vogue before he walked the Oscars red carpet, knew what he was in for among some social media users:

“People are going to be really uncomfortable with my black ass in a ball gown, but it’s not anybody’s business but mine.”

The remark from the Tony-winning stage performer, actor and singer was both prescient and disproven. There was mega-praise for his velvet custom tuxedo look by Christian Siriano and outrage over the notion that an African American man in a dress was a threat to black masculinity.

It was just the conversation Porter had hoped to provoke, not to collect virulent hate but to help move along the idea that we all deserve respect, across racial lines and the gender divide.

“I was ready to create the conversation,” Porter told The Associated Press in a phone interview Monday the day after the Oscars. “We have to teach people how to treat us, we have to teach people how to love us, we have to teach people how to respect us, and the only way we do that is to respect ourselves.”

Porter, the black and gay breakout star of the boundary-expanding FX series “Pose,” spent awards season using fashion as political art, as he describes it. There were previous dresses, and there was help from powerhouses Tom Ford and Michael Kors in the later weeks, along with smaller designers who embrace a greater gender fluidity in their collections and were thrilled early on to dress him.

As a nominee at the Golden Globes, Porter’s custom trouser look by Randi Rahm, including a huge, hot pink-lined cape and floral embellishments, grabbed attention, but social media support and disdain after the 49-year-old took to the Oscars carpet took the debate into the stratosphere.

Porter understands where established notions of black masculinity originated, and he understands how toxic they can be. He and his stylist, Sam Ratelle, also realize how rigid gender-driven taboos can be and want to help the walls come down.

“It goes all the way back to the earliest of emasculations, which is slavery, so the only way to sort of overcome that is to be the strongest and the most masculine and the most powerful and now, what has become toxic,” Porter said. “And I don’t think it’s just black people. I think it’s men in general. Every ethnicity has their version of it.”

Porter couldn’t care less about negative comments.

“The comments are not my business. What people think about what I’m doing is not my business. I lived that already,” he said. “I’m inside of my authenticity and the whole point is that you have to respect me as much as I respect you. If you don’t like it, go somewhere else. You don’t have to look. It’s not about you. I don’t understand why my putting on a dress causes this much strife in your life.”

Ratelle said he began working with Porter about a year ago.

“He said, ‘I want to be a piece of walking art,’ and we just went from there,” Ratelle said. “It’s been really awesome to work with a bunch of great designers. Randi Rahm was certainly completely open. Issey Miyake was fantastic for the Radio City show (Porter was a study in white). Christian Siriano, the fact that he did this custom gown in one week, was incredible after saying, ‘Absolutely. There’s no question we’ll do this.’ Michael Kors has been the most gracious human. So has Tom Ford.”

Porter said he’s just getting started in terms of pushing along the conversation.

“People are actually listening,” he said. “I hope it opens up a dialogue of healing. I will always continue to do me. If there’s anything I’ve learned in the 49 years that I’ve lived on this planet, is that being authentic is the only version of the story that anybody should be.”

Porter has always been a fashion lover. This year, he was an ambassador for the Council of Fashion Designers of America for men’s fashion week in New York and attended a variety of shows featuring a variety of looks, from traditional to gender fluid.

Now that awards season is over, and the fashion week cycle is finishing up in Paris, Porter said he’ll continue to wear whatever he likes, with a great number of designers on board to help with pulls from their lines and custom outfits.

“Pre-Golden Globes it was difficult,” he said of options available to him, considering that he’s not sample size. “After the Golden Globes it has not been difficult. You work with the people who work with you. You walk through the doors that are open. I’m never a beggar.”

In real life, or at least on live TV during the Oscars, Helen Mirren appeared ready for change, noting that both she and her co-presenter, Jason Momoa, were dressed in pink.

“It just goes to show, doesn’t it, that these days a Hawaiian god and a very mature Englishwoman can actually wear the same color. We can both wear pink,” she said to claps.

Momoa agreed: “Finally. The times are changin’.”

Pelé was simply “The King.” He embraced “the beautiful game” of soccer in his 1958 World Cup debut for Brazil and never really let go.
He won a record three World Cups and was widely regarded as one of his sport’s greatest players. His majestic and galvanizing presence set him among the most recognizable figures in the world.
Pelé died Thursday at 82. He had undergone treatment for colon cancer since 2021.
Pelé was among the game’s most prolific scorers and spent nearly two decades enchanting fans and dazzling opponents. His grace, athleticism and moves on soccer’s highest stage transfixed all. He orchestrated a fast, fluid style of play that revolutionized the sport — a flair that personified Brazilian elegance on the field.
He carried his country to soccer’s heights and became a global ambassador for his sport in a journey that began on the streets of Sao Paulo state, where he would kick a sock stuffed with newspapers or rags.
“Pelé changed everything. He transformed football into art, entertainment,” Neymar, a fellow Brazilian soccer player, said on Instagram. “Football and Brazil elevated their standing thanks to the King! He is gone, but his magic will endure. Pelé is eternal!”
In the conversation about soccer’s greatest player, only the late Diego Maradona, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are mentioned alongside him.
Different sources, counting different sets of games, list Pelé’s goal totals anywhere between 650 (league matches) to 1,281 (all senior matches, some against low-level competition). When Maradona once interviewed Pelé, he playfully asked the Brazilian how he accumulated so many goals.
The player who would be dubbed “The King” was introduced to the world at 17 at the 1958 World Cup in Sweden, the youngest player ever at the tournament.
Pelé was the emblem of his country’s World Cup triumph of 1970 in Mexico. He scored in the final and set up Carlos Alberto with a nonchalant pass for the last goal in a 4-1 victory over Italy.
The image of Pelé in a bright-yellow Brazil jersey, with the No. 10 stamped on the back, remains alive with soccer fans everywhere. As does his trademark goal celebration — a leap with a right fist thrust high above his head.
Pelé’s fame was such that in 1967 factions of a civil war in Nigeria agreed to a brief cease-fire so he could play an exhibition match in the country. He was knighted by Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II in 1997. When Pelé visited Washington to help popularize the game in North America, it was the U.S. president who stuck out his hand first.
“You don’t need to introduce yourself because everyone knows who Pelé is,” Ronald Reagan said.
Pelé was Brazil’s first modern Black national hero but rarely spoke about racism in a country where the rich and powerful tend to hail from the white minority.
Opposing fans taunted Pelé with monkey chants at home and all over the world.
“He said that he would never play if he had to stop every time he heard those chants,” said Angelica Basthi, one of Pelé’s biographers. “He is key for Black people’s pride in Brazil, but never wanted to be a flagbearer.”
Pelé’s life after soccer took many forms. He was a politician — Brazil’s Extraordinary Minister for Sport — a wealthy businessman, and an ambassador for UNESCO and the United Nations.
He had roles in movies, soap operas and even composed songs and recorded CDs of popular Brazilian music.
Pelé was an ambassador for his sport until his final years but as his health deteriorated his travels and appearances became less frequent. After needing a hip replacement, he started using a cane.
He was often seen in a wheelchair during his final years and did not attend a ceremony to unveil a statue of him representing Brazil’s 1970 World Cup team.
“He gets very shy, he gets very embarrassed,” his son Edinho told Globoesporte.com. “He doesn’t want to go out.”
Pelé spent his 80th birthday with a few relatives.
Pelé spent a month hospitalized in 2021 after surgery to remove a tumor from his colon. Pelé said he was ready “to play 90 minutes, plus extra time,” but soon started chemotherapy.
Born Edson Arantes do Nascimento, in the small city of Tres Coracoes in the interior of Minas Gerais state on Oct. 23, 1940, Pelé grew up shining shoes to buy his modest soccer gear. His father was also a player.
Pelé’s talent drew notice when he was 11, and a local professional player brought him to Santos’ youth squads. Despite his youth and 5-foot-8 frame Pelé’ scored against grown men with the same ease he displayed against friends back home. He debuted with the Brazilian club at 15 in 1956, and the club quickly gained worldwide recognition.
The name Pelé came from him mispronouncing the name of a player called Bilé. He later became known simply as ‘O Rei’ – The King.
Pelé went to the 1958 World Cup as a reserve but became a key part for his country’s championship team. His first goal, in which he flicked the ball over the head of a defender and raced around him to volley it home, was voted as one of the best in World Cup history.
“When Pelé scored,” veteran Swedish midfielder Sigge Parling said, “I have to be honest and say I felt like applauding.”
The 1966 World Cup in England — won by the hosts — was a bitter one for Pelé, by then already considered the world’s top player. Brazil was knocked out at the group stage and Pelé, angry at fouls and hard tackles by Portugal, swore it was his last World Cup.
He changed his mind and was rejuvenated in the 1970 World Cup. In a game against England, he struck a header for a certain score, but the great goalkeeper Gordon Banks flipped the ball over the bar in an astonishing move. Pelé likened the save — one of the best in World Cup history — to a “salmon climbing up a waterfall.” Later, he scored the opening goal in the final against Italy, his last World Cup match.
In all, Pelé played 114 matches with Brazil, scoring a record 95 goals — including 77 in official matches. Most of his goals came with Santos, which he led to five national titles, two Copa Libertadores trophies and two club world championships — all in the 1960s.
His run with Santos stretched over three decades until he went into semi-retirement after the 1972 season. Wealthy European clubs tried to sign him, but the Brazilian government intervened to keep him from being sold, declaring him a national treasure.
On the field, Pelé’s energy, vision and imagination drove a gifted Brazilian national team, with intricate passing combinations slicing defenses while leaving room for players to showcase flashy skills.
The fast, fluid style of play exemplified “O Jogo Bonito” — Portuguese for “The Beautiful Game.” And at the center of it all, like a maestro in command of his orchestra, was Pelé. It was his 1977 autobiography, “My Life and the Beautiful Game,” that made the phrase part of soccer’s lexicon.
In 1975, he joined the New York Cosmos of the North American Soccer League. Although he was past his prime at 34 years old, Pelé briefly gave soccer a higher profile in North America before ending his career on Oct. 1, 1977, in an exhibition between the Cosmos and Santos. Among the dignitaries on hand was perhaps the only other athlete whose renown spanned the globe — Muhammad Ali.
Pelé had two daughters out of wedlock and five children from his first two marriages, to Rosemeri dos Reis Cholbi and Assiria Seixas Lemos. He later married businesswoman Marcia Cibele Aoki.

Pelé was simply “The King.” He embraced “the beautiful game” of soccer in his 1958 World Cup debut for Brazil and never really let go.
He won a record three World Cups and was widely regarded as one of his sport’s greatest players. His majestic and galvanizing presence set him among the most recognizable figures in the world.
Pelé died Thursday at 82. He had undergone treatment for colon cancer since 2021.
Pelé was among the game’s most prolific scorers and spent nearly two decades enchanting fans and dazzling opponents. His grace, athleticism and moves on soccer’s highest stage transfixed all. He orchestrated a fast, fluid style of play that revolutionized the sport — a flair that personified Brazilian elegance on the field.
He carried his country to soccer’s heights and became a global ambassador for his sport in a journey that began on the streets of Sao Paulo state, where he would kick a sock stuffed with newspapers or rags.
“Pelé changed everything. He transformed football into art, entertainment,” Neymar, a fellow Brazilian soccer player, said on Instagram. “Football and Brazil elevated their standing thanks to the King! He is gone, but his magic will endure. Pelé is eternal!”
In the conversation about soccer’s greatest player, only the late Diego Maradona, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are mentioned alongside him.
Different sources, counting different sets of games, list Pelé’s goal totals anywhere between 650 (league matches) to 1,281 (all senior matches, some against low-level competition). When Maradona once interviewed Pelé, he playfully asked the Brazilian how he accumulated so many goals.
The player who would be dubbed “The King” was introduced to the world at 17 at the 1958 World Cup in Sweden, the youngest player ever at the tournament.
Pelé was the emblem of his country’s World Cup triumph of 1970 in Mexico. He scored in the final and set up Carlos Alberto with a nonchalant pass for the last goal in a 4-1 victory over Italy.
The image of Pelé in a bright-yellow Brazil jersey, with the No. 10 stamped on the back, remains alive with soccer fans everywhere. As does his trademark goal celebration — a leap with a right fist thrust high above his head.
Pelé’s fame was such that in 1967 factions of a civil war in Nigeria agreed to a brief cease-fire so he could play an exhibition match in the country. He was knighted by Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II in 1997. When Pelé visited Washington to help popularize the game in North America, it was the U.S. president who stuck out his hand first.
“You don’t need to introduce yourself because everyone knows who Pelé is,” Ronald Reagan said.
Pelé was Brazil’s first modern Black national hero but rarely spoke about racism in a country where the rich and powerful tend to hail from the white minority.
Opposing fans taunted Pelé with monkey chants at home and all over the world.
“He said that he would never play if he had to stop every time he heard those chants,” said Angelica Basthi, one of Pelé’s biographers. “He is key for Black people’s pride in Brazil, but never wanted to be a flagbearer.”
Pelé’s life after soccer took many forms. He was a politician — Brazil’s Extraordinary Minister for Sport — a wealthy businessman, and an ambassador for UNESCO and the United Nations.
He had roles in movies, soap operas and even composed songs and recorded CDs of popular Brazilian music.
Pelé was an ambassador for his sport until his final years but as his health deteriorated his travels and appearances became less frequent. After needing a hip replacement, he started using a cane.
He was often seen in a wheelchair during his final years and did not attend a ceremony to unveil a statue of him representing Brazil’s 1970 World Cup team.
“He gets very shy, he gets very embarrassed,” his son Edinho told Globoesporte.com. “He doesn’t want to go out.”
Pelé spent his 80th birthday with a few relatives.
Pelé spent a month hospitalized in 2021 after surgery to remove a tumor from his colon. Pelé said he was ready “to play 90 minutes, plus extra time,” but soon started chemotherapy.
Born Edson Arantes do Nascimento, in the small city of Tres Coracoes in the interior of Minas Gerais state on Oct. 23, 1940, Pelé grew up shining shoes to buy his modest soccer gear. His father was also a player.
Pelé’s talent drew notice when he was 11, and a local professional player brought him to Santos’ youth squads. Despite his youth and 5-foot-8 frame Pelé’ scored against grown men with the same ease he displayed against friends back home. He debuted with the Brazilian club at 15 in 1956, and the club quickly gained worldwide recognition.
The name Pelé came from him mispronouncing the name of a player called Bilé. He later became known simply as ‘O Rei’ – The King.
Pelé went to the 1958 World Cup as a reserve but became a key part for his country’s championship team. His first goal, in which he flicked the ball over the head of a defender and raced around him to volley it home, was voted as one of the best in World Cup history.
“When Pelé scored,” veteran Swedish midfielder Sigge Parling said, “I have to be honest and say I felt like applauding.”
The 1966 World Cup in England — won by the hosts — was a bitter one for Pelé, by then already considered the world’s top player. Brazil was knocked out at the group stage and Pelé, angry at fouls and hard tackles by Portugal, swore it was his last World Cup.
He changed his mind and was rejuvenated in the 1970 World Cup. In a game against England, he struck a header for a certain score, but the great goalkeeper Gordon Banks flipped the ball over the bar in an astonishing move. Pelé likened the save — one of the best in World Cup history — to a “salmon climbing up a waterfall.” Later, he scored the opening goal in the final against Italy, his last World Cup match.
In all, Pelé played 114 matches with Brazil, scoring a record 95 goals — including 77 in official matches. Most of his goals came with Santos, which he led to five national titles, two Copa Libertadores trophies and two club world championships — all in the 1960s.
His run with Santos stretched over three decades until he went into semi-retirement after the 1972 season. Wealthy European clubs tried to sign him, but the Brazilian government intervened to keep him from being sold, declaring him a national treasure.
On the field, Pelé’s energy, vision and imagination drove a gifted Brazilian national team, with intricate passing combinations slicing defenses while leaving room for players to showcase flashy skills.
The fast, fluid style of play exemplified “O Jogo Bonito” — Portuguese for “The Beautiful Game.” And at the center of it all, like a maestro in command of his orchestra, was Pelé. It was his 1977 autobiography, “My Life and the Beautiful Game,” that made the phrase part of soccer’s lexicon.
In 1975, he joined the New York Cosmos of the North American Soccer League. Although he was past his prime at 34 years old, Pelé briefly gave soccer a higher profile in North America before ending his career on Oct. 1, 1977, in an exhibition between the Cosmos and Santos. Among the dignitaries on hand was perhaps the only other athlete whose renown spanned the globe — Muhammad Ali.
Pelé had two daughters out of wedlock and five children from his first two marriages, to Rosemeri dos Reis Cholbi and Assiria Seixas Lemos. He later married businesswoman Marcia Cibele Aoki.

Sri Lanka’s inexperienced cricket team overcame a poor start with bat and ball to put on an impressive all-round show Sunday and win the Asia Cup for the sixth time with a 23-run victory over Pakistan.
Bhanuka Rajapaksa hit an unbeaten 71 off 45 balls in Dubai and led Sri Lanka as it recovered from 58-5 to reach 170-6 in the final after Pakistan won the toss and elected to field.
Pakistan crashed to 147 all out off the last balls as its top order continued to struggle against the pace with fast bowler Pramod Madushan claiming 4-34 in only his second T20 international.
Leg-spinner Wanindu Hasaranga then baffled the lower order with his sharp googlies to accelerate Pakistan’s collapse.
Hasaranga, who earlier scored 36 off 21 balls, had Pakistan’s top-scorer Mohammad Rizwan (55) caught in the deep in his last over before claiming the wickets of Asif Ali and Khushdil Shah in the same over to finish with 3-27.
“It was all about nerves, I knew the youngsters can always deliver,” Sri Lanka skipper Dasun Shanaka said. “We have players with good caliber, and they stood up well.”
Sri Lanka had an awful bowling start when left-arm fast bowler Dilshan Madushanka conceded nine runs through a no ball and several wides before the 21-year-old’s first legitimate delivery at the sixth attempt.
Madushan, who made his T20 debut in the last Super 4 match against Pakistan on Friday, settled his team’s nerves quickly by claiming the wickets of Babar Azam (5) and Fakhar Azam (0) off successive deliveries inside the powerplay.
Babar was brilliantly snapped up by Madushanka over his head at short fine leg off a hard flick and Fakhar went for a golden duck by dragging the first ball onto his stumps.
Babar, the second-ranked T20 batter, ended the tournament with only 68 runs in six games.
“As a batting unit we didn’t perform according to our potential,” Babar said. “We didn’t finish the way we would have wanted to and gave away 15-20 extra runs … the more you learn from these ups-and-downs is good, but you need to reduce your mistakes.”
Rizwan and Iftikhar Ahmed (32) added 71 runs for the third wicket in almost 10 overs as Sri Lanka kept mounting the pressure by bowling tidily in the middle overs.
Madushan broke the stand in his return spell as Pakistan collapsed from 102-3 to lose its last seven wickets for 45 runs with Sri Lanka fielders holding onto all their catches.
Earlier, Pakistan’s fearsome pace attack, led by Haris Rauf (3-29), had Sri Lanka in trouble inside the first nine overs before Rajapaksa and Hasaranga led the recovery.
Rajapaksa hit six fours and three sixes in his innings.
Fast bowler Naseem Shah (1-40) had Kusal Mendis clean bowled off the first ball with a stunning inswinging delivery while Rauf dismissed Pathum Nissanka and Danushka Gunathilaka.
But Rajapaksa and Hasaranga counterattacked after having negotiated the spin threat of Shadab Khan (1-28). Surprisingly Babar used his premium left-arm spinner Mohammad Nawaz for only one over which went for three runs as both Sri Lanka batters cut loose against the pace of Shah and Mohammad Hasnain (0-41).
Pakistan was scrappy in the field as Rajapaksa was dropped either side of his half century by Shadab in the deep. Rauf had Hasaranga caught behind in the 15th over, but Rajapaksa added a further 54 runs in the last five overs with Chamika Karunaratne, who made 14 not out.
Rajapaksa provided Sri Lanka with a late flourish when he smashed Shah for a boundary off the penultimate ball and then smashed a six over extra cover to give Sri Lanka a strong total to defend.
Sri Lanka made a stunning comeback with five successive wins in the tournament after getting beaten by Afghanistan in its opening game. Sri Lanka also beat Pakistan in the last Super 4 game.

Mislav Oršić must wish he could play English teams every week.
The Croatia forward ran from the halfway line and produced a deft finish in the 13th minute to lead Dinamo Zagreb to a surprising 1-0 win over Chelsea in their opening Group E match in the Champions League on Tuesday.
Add that goal to Oršić’s feats against English clubs in the Europa League: a winner against West Ham last season and a hat trick to eliminate Jose Mourinho’s Tottenham in 2020-21.
It marked a memorable start by Dinamo to its first group-stage campaign in Europe’s top competition since 2019-20, having reached this point by coming through three qualifying rounds.
As for Chelsea, it was the latest disappointing result in an unconvincing start to the season for a club that spent nearly $300 million on refreshing its squad in the summer transfer window.
The two-time European champions dominated the match in the Croatian capital but were let down by poor finishing, which dovetailed with scrambling defense and some great saves by Dominik Livaković for the hosts.
“We are clearly not where we need to be, or where we can be,” said Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel, whose team has already lost to Leeds and Southampton in the Premier League.
Asked specifically what he didn’t like about Chelsea’s performance, Tuchel said: “At the moment, everything is missing.”
In the second half, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang — making his debut for Chelsea after a deadline-day move from Barcelona and wearing a mask to protect his injured cheek — had a goal disallowed for a narrow offside against Ben Chilwell in the build-up. Then, in a frantic finish, Reece James smashed a shot against the post before Livaković made a stunning double stop to deny Mason Mount then Hakim Ziyech.
Ultimately, the smash-and-grab win was earned thanks to the early goal by Oršić, who met a headed flick-on by Bruno Petković in midfield by chesting the ball forward inside his own half past Chelsea defender Wesley Fofana and racing clear of the newly signed French defender toward goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga.
As he approached Kepa, Oršić lifted the ball over the keeper and it bobbled into the net.
Dinamo looked dangerous in the rare attacks it had in a performance underpinned by defensive discipline and, from one counterattack, Stefan Ristovski powered in a rising shot that was tipped onto the crossbar by Kepa, who was selected ahead of Edouard Mendy.
“It’s an underperformance from us,” Tuchel said. “We have the same story as always — we have an OK start, we don’t finish our half-chances, we don’t feel it when the game is already there to put to bed in the first 15-20 minutes, then we concede one counter-attack which is far too easy.
“And from there, we struggled.”

Remember that time, not so long ago, when there was a crisis at Manchester United?
After four straight wins, it seems like a dim and distant memory.
The latest sign that United is well on the road to recovery came on Sunday with a 3-1 win over Arsenal, whose 100% start to the season came crashing to an end.
There were still anti-Glazer chants inside and outside Old Trafford — it feels like they are here to stay, whether the team wins or loses — but they are now accompanied by frequent and jubilant roars for goals.
Two of them were scored in the second half by Marcus Rashford to sweep United to victory after Arsenal pulled it back to 1-1 through Bukayo Saka, but the opening goal felt the most significant.
Antony, United’s latest big signing from Ajax for $95 million, marked his first match in English soccer with a goal from a curling, first-time finish in the 35th minute, crowning a performance that featured a slew of jinks, feints and exaggerated stepovers that thrilled home fans. He came off in the 58th to a standing ovation to be replaced by Cristiano Ronaldo, who again had to settle for a starting spot on the bench.
Since that humiliating 4-0 loss at Brentford that sparked a crisis and some doubts around the wisdom of hiring Erik ten Hag as manager, United has beaten Liverpool, Southampton, Leicester and now Arsenal, the league leader.
After six games, United is only three points behind Arsenal and two behind Manchester City, the title favorite.
How quickly things have turned around.

Manchester United secured its third straight win in the Premier League by beating Leicester 1-0 on Thursday, with Cristiano Ronaldo again only making a late appearance off the bench.
Jadon Sancho finished off a flowing move on the break for the only goal of the game in the 23rd minute as United’s players backed up victories over Liverpool and Southampton to put their early-season crisis behind them.
“It is another step forward,” United manager Erik ten Hag said.
It was only 10 days ago that United went into its home game against Liverpool on the back of back-to-back defeats to open the season with doubts swirling around the suitability of Ten Hag — its recently hired coach from Ajax — and his new signings.
Those doubts have pretty much disappeared, with United playing with more confidence and the additions of Casemiro — a second-half substitute like Ronaldo — and Antony — who wasn’t available after completing his move from Ajax on Thursday — strengthening the team. Back-to-back clean sheets is a big positive, too.
Ronaldo might yet play a significant part this season after failing to secure a move away in the transfer market that shut soon after the full-time whistle. He came on in the 68th minute and looked lively, an acrobatic bicycle kick flying just wide.
“Once we have Cristiano Ronaldo and Casemiro getting fitter, it will get better still,” Ten Hag said. “We need not only a team, we need a squad.”
In the end, Sancho’s goal separated the teams and it came after United claimed possession following a Leicester goal kick. Bruno Fernandes found Marcus Rashford in a central position and he slipped in Sancho, who rounded goalkeeper Danny Ward and slotted the ball into an empty net.
Leicester is now the Premier League’s crisis club, with just one point from its first five games and two points adrift in last place. The pressure is rising on its manager, Brendan Rodgers, who grumbled after the match about the club’s failure to strengthen the squad in the summer transfer.
Leicester only signed one outfield player, unheralded defender Wout Faes from French club Reims, and he only arrived on deadline day to fill the gap left by the departure of Wesley Fofana to Chelsea.
“With the greatest respect,” Rodgers said, “we have not had the help in the market this team needed.”
The hosts only seriously threatened United goalkeeper David De Gea once and that was from a free kick, which James Maddison whipped over the defensive wall and brought out a fine one-handed save. James Justin blazed over in stoppage time with Leicester’s other good chance.
United will face a bigger challenge on Sunday, when Arsenal — with its 100% record — visits Old Trafford.
“It is a good test to see where we are,” Ten Hag said.

Erling Haaland is taking English soccer by storm.
Back-to-back hat tricks. Nine goals in five games. No player has ever made as good a start to the Premier League as the towering Norway striker.
Haaland’s latest three-goal haul came in the first half of City’s 6-0 thrashing of Nottingham Forest on Tuesday, three days after achieving the same feat in the second half against Crystal Palace.
City was banking on Haaland being the heir to long-time striker Sergio Aguero and it’s already looking as if that is the case.
Aguero previously held the record for most goals in a player’s first five Premier League appearances, with eight along with former Coventry striker Mick Quinn (from the early 1990s). Haaland has bettered that, and surely more scoring records will fall if he continues like this.
For example, can he become the first player to score 40 goals in a single top-flight campaign in England since Tottenham’s Jimmy Greaves in 1960-61?
“What Haaland wants is to win titles,” Guardiola said of the striker who scored with his left foot, right foot and head against Forest. “Knowing him, he would not be happy to break records if we don’t win titles.
“Sergio is a legend — no one can break his position in the hearts of Man City fans. But Erling has the quality to be there.”
City is the red-hot favorite to win the Premier League again with Haaland leading the line and is unbeaten with four wins from five games.
Even its back-up striker is scoring, with Julian Alvarez — an offseason arrival from River Plate — marking his first start with two goals in the second half. Joao Cancelo also scored with a blast from outside the box.
Still, the champions aren’t top. That honor remains with Arsenal.
PERFECT START
Arsenal has matched its best ever start to a Premier League season after securing a fifth straight win to open the season by beating Aston Villa 2-1.
Gabriel Martinelli’s 77th-minute goal clinched victory at Emirates Stadium after Arsenal was pegged back by conceding a goal straight from a corner by Douglas Luiz, who did the same in an English League Cup match last week, too.
That came against the run of play, with Arsenal dominating the game but only having Gabriel Jesus’ 30th-minute goal — his third of the season — to show for it.
“That is the spirit we need to keep for the whole season,” Martinelli said.
Villa has lost four of its five games, leaving manager Steven Gerrard under pressure.
LATE, LATE GOAL
Liverpool is battling hard to keep up with the fierce pace set by Arsenal and City, needing a goal in the eighth minute of stoppage time by Fábio Carvalho to claim a dramatic 2-1 win over Newcastle.
Alexander Isak gave Newcastle the lead in the 38th on his debut following a move from Real Sociedad on Friday for a club-record fee and was denied a second goal by narrow offside call.
Roberto Firmino swept in a finish from Mohamed Salah’s cross to equalize before a penalty-box melee following a corner saw the ball pop up off the shoulder of Salah, and Carvalho — a summer signing from Fulham — reacted quickest to smash into the roof of the net.
“I am not sure everyone in the stadium kept believing but from now on we have to,” Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp said. “What a wonderful goal from the little one.”
It was a second straight victory for Liverpool, which opened the season without winning any of its first three games.
SPURS UNBEATEN
Tottenham remained unbeaten after a 1-1 draw at West Ham, for whom club-record signing Lucas Paqueta missed a chance to score a late winner on his debut.
West Ham manager David Moyes said before kickoff that Paqueta had not so much as passed a ball to his new teammates after only completing his 52 million pound ($61.6 million) switch from Lyon on Monday.
With four minutes remaining, Vladimir Coufal pulled the ball back and Paqueta — on as a 67th-minute substitute — got in a mix-up with fellow new signing Emerson Palmieri as they left the ball to each other, 10 meters from goal, instead of taking a shot. Moyes fell to his knees on the touchline.
An own-goal from Thilo Kehrer gave Tottenham the lead before Tomas Soucek equalized.
In the other game, Bournemouth drew 0-0 at home to Wolverhampton, two days after firing manager Scott Parker.

Erling Haaland scored his first Premier League hat-trick as Manchester City came from two goals down to beat Crystal Palace 4-2 on Saturday.
City trailed 2-0 after just 21 minutes against a clinical Palace side — which was looking to its 2-0 win at the Etihad Stadium last season — after an own-goal by John Stones and a header by Joachim Andersen.
It was the fourth Premier League game out of the last six in which City had fallen two goals behind, but Pep Guardiola’s team had not lost any of the previous three and went on to win this one in style.
After Bernardo Silva pulled one back eight minutes into the second half, Haaland took over as his first home goals for City came in a hurry. He netted three in the space of 20 minutes to make it six in his first four Premier League matches.
Patrick Vieira was forced to name a starting 11 without Wilfried Zaha due to injury, but the absence of the star forward did not prevent Palace from storming into an early lead as Eberechi Eze’s free kick struck both Kyle Walker and Stones as it spun into the net.
Things got worse for City in the 22nd minute from another set piece. It was Eze again with a corner from which Andersen was left unmarked to power in a header.
Guardiola had been planning two substitutions early in the second half with Ilkay Gundogan and Julian Alvarez both stripped and ready to go, but they sat back down after Silva got City back into it in the 53rd minute.
The Portugal international cut in from the right before hitting a low shot which deflected off Jeffrey Schlupp on its way in.
Gundogan and Alvarez did come on just after the hour and Alvarez quickly made an impact as City leveled in the 62nd. He flicked on a deep cross to Phil Foden, who chipped the ball back in for Haaland, who got across Marc Guehi to head in his first Etihad goal.
Eight minutes later he had his second. From a short corner, Alvarez fed Silva who pulled the ball back for Stones and he rolled it across for Haaland to poke home from a yard out.
Haaland sealed his hat-trick with 10 minutes to go. Silva’s through ball found his run perfectly, and the Norwegian had the strength to hold off Joel Ward before firing into the bottom corner.
City now has 10 points from four games, with Palace left on four points.

Raheem Sterling’s first goals for Chelsea gave the 10-man Blues a 2-1 victory over winless Leicester in the English Premier League on Saturday.
Sterling’s second half double proved decisive at Stamford Bridge as the hosts overcame the early sending off of England midfielder Conor Gallagher.
Manager Thomas Tuchel was also absent as he was serving a touchline ban following his confrontation with Antonio Conte in the opening home match against Tottenham, while Gallagher was dismissed in the 28th minute after getting two yellow cards.
Chelsea was awarded an early penalty when Ruben Loftus-Cheek went down in the box, but referee Paul Tierney overturned his decision after Kai Havertz was adjudged to have been offside in the buildup.
Seven minutes before the break, the visitors thought they took the lead when Harvey Barnes headed home, but the effort was ruled out for a foul on Blues goalkeeper Edouard Mendy.
The hosts came close to breaking the deadlock four minutes later when Reece James struck the post with an effort from Sterling’s cross, then Jamie Vardy shot wide at the other end after good work by Youri Tielemans.
A little more than a minute after the restart, Sterling broke the deadlock with a shot from the edge of the area, after being found by Marc Cucurella.
The Blues, who introduced Cesar Azpilicueta at halftime, went from four at the back to three and looked more threatening.
They doubled their lead in the 63rd minute when Sterling tapped in James’ cross at the far post. However, the Foxes pulled one back three minutes later when Barnes beat Mendy at his near post.
Vardy fired a shot into the side-netting and Ayoze Perez came close as the visitors sought an equalizer. However, Chelsea held on for its first home win.
Leicester defender Wesley Fofana was left out of Brendan Rodgers’ squad amid reports he is close to finalizing a transfer to Chelsea.

Liverpool equaled the biggest win in English Premier League history after a 9-0 hammering of promoted Bournemouth on Saturday.
Jurgen Klopp’s side started the campaign slowly, with surprise draws against Fulham and Crystal Palace compounded by Monday’s loss at rival Manchester United. But Liverpool’s fearsome attack looked back to its best at Anfield as the team recorded its first league win and Roberto Firmino and Luis Diaz both grabbed two goals.
It’s only the fifth time a team scored nine goals in the league, with Man United (twice) and Leicester the only previous teams to win 9-0.
Firmino, starting in place of suspended summer signing Darwin Nunez, produced a stunning first-half display, which began with Diaz heading home his clipped cross within three minutes of the kickoff.
Firmino then provided the assist for Harvey Elliott’s first league goal — a fizzing strike from distance that would have been goal of the day were it not for the Trent Alexander-Arnold stunner that followed.
The Brazil forward set up that goal and celebrated one of his own soon after when turning in a deflected cross -- his first league goal at Anfield since December 2020.
Virgil van Dijk powered home Liverpool’s fifth on the stroke of halftime, while the onslaught continued just after the break in the form of Chris Mepham’s own-goal.
Firmino grabbed a second of the afternoon before leaving to a standing ovation.
The goals did not stop there, though, as Fabio Carvalho scored his first for the club and Diaz grabbed his second.

Manchester United’s stand-in captain Bruno Fernandes made it back-to-back wins for Erik ten Hag’s team by scoring the only goal in a 1-0 victory over Southampton in the Premier League on Saturday.
Wearing the captain’s armband in place of the still-benched Harry Maguire, Fernandes steered in a cross from Diogo Dalot in the 55th minute as United followed up Monday’s win over Liverpool with another morale-boosting performance.
Having started the season with two straight losses — including a 4-0 drubbing at Brentford — United has now won consecutive league matches for the first time since February.
It was also the team’s first clean sheet of the season, thanks in part to David de Gea’s reflex save to keep out a header from Joe Aribo in the 66th.
It’s a result that will give a bit more breathing space to Ten Hag, the Dutch manager who faced a torrent of criticism and skepticism after the team’s dismal start to the campaign.
Ten Hag’s decisions to leave Maguire and star forward Cristiano Ronaldo on the bench were vindicated once again, with center-back pairing Lisandro Martinez and Raphael Varane looking solid in defense.
United did struggle to create quality chances in the first half, although Ten Hag was shaking his head in disbelief that his team didn’t go ahead in the 20th minute when they had three shots on goal from close range in the span of a few seconds.
Anthony Elanga’s effort from a tight angle was saved by goalkeeper Gavin Bazunu before Fernandes and Christian Eriksen both had their follow-up shots blocked by diving defenders.
Southampton had its best first-half chance on the half-hour mark when a corner fell to Armel Bella-Kotchap at the back post, but he lifted it over the crossbar.
United started stronger in the second half and got the goal after a well-worked move down the right flank. Dalot lifted a cross into the area and Fernandes was on hand to sidefoot it inside the far post.
Ronaldo and United’s new signing Casemiro — the Portugal star’s former teammate at Real Madrid — both came on in the second half.
Substitute Sekou Mara had two chances to equalize for Southampton in injury time, but his spectacular overhead kick was blocked by Dalot and he sidefooted another effort wide of the post a minute later.

Finally, there are signs of life at Manchester United.
Against a backdrop of protests against the club’s ownership, United delivered a performance of intensity and spirit to beat fierce rival Liverpool 2-1 on Monday and claim its first points in the Premier League this season.
Composed finishes by Jadon Sancho in the 16th minute and Marcus Rashford in the 53rd earned a victory at Old Trafford that will bring some respite for under-pressure manager Erik ten Hag, who made a huge statement in his team selection by dropping star striker Cristiano Ronaldo and club captain Harry Maguire and was validated.
“I wanted a different attitude and that is what I saw them bring on the pitch,” said Ten Hag, who has started his tenure at United amid something of a crisis at England’s biggest club. “But it’s only the start.”
Suddenly, the heat is on Liverpool — widely expected to be a title contender again this season — with Jürgen Klopp’s team still waiting for a win after three games and now languishing behind United in the standings on just two points.
Mohamed Salah scored an 81st-minute consolation but it was another below-par display from Liverpool after draws with Fulham and Crystal Palace, even if this was a first league loss in 2022.
“In the warm-up, it was the quietest I have heard this stadium and they wanted something to lift them,” Liverpool defender Andrew Robertson said. “And we gave them it.”
What is historically the biggest game in English soccer was preceded by a pre-match protest by thousands of United fans angry at the direction and state of the club under its owners of 17 years, the Glazer family.
The supporters called for the U.S-based Glazers to sell the club as they walked to Old Trafford then gathered on the concourse outside the storied stadium, in front of a large police presence. Many lingered as the match began.
The pressure was on United after losses to Brighton (2-1) and Brentford (4-0) to open the season, and the players fed off a frenzied atmosphere that seemed to affect Liverpool early on.
“The start of the game was exactly what everyone expected, what United fans expected. They were after us,” Klopp said. “They started slightly more aggressive than us.”
Lisandro Martinez, an offseason signing at center back who has come under enormous criticism in recent days, was particularly impressive and set the tone by clattering into Salah in the first minute, then barging into the Liverpool forward after getting up off the ground. Later in the first half, Raphael Varane, who replaced Maguire, virtually rugby-tackled Luis Diaz to the ground, to roars of approval from United’s fans even if it earned him a booking.
Sancho’s goal came in United’s best spell of the game, the winger showing great composure to trick James Milner by feigning to shoot, cut back inside and place a shot into the corner as Virgil van Dijk bizarrely stood motionless in front of him. It was the seventh straight Premier League match that Liverpool had fallen behind.
The stadium erupted again when Anthony Martial, a halftime substitute, played through Rashford and the striker sprinted toward the area before placing a calm finish inside the near post.
United had to defend stoutly at times but hung on to end an eight-match winless run against Liverpool and a losing streak of four matches in the league stretching back to the end of last season.
It’s down to United to string a run of similar battling performances together, starting at Southampton next weekend. Ten Hag will have Casemiro, whose $60 million signing from Real Madrid was completed Monday, available for that game and the Brazil midfielder was presented on the field before kickoff.
With more signings potentially arriving before the end of the transfer window, things might be looking up for the record 20-time English champions.
“We just have to produce like today in every single game,” Sancho said.

Manchester City was given a major scare by Newcastle before coming from behind to draw 3-3 in a thrilling Premier League game on Sunday.
City needed goals in the space of four minutes after the hour mark from Erling Haaland and Bernardo Silva to salvage a point at St. James’ Park and maintain the unbeaten start to its title defense.
Newcastle battered City for much of the first half and just after halftime, responding to going behind to Ilkay Gundogan’s fifth-minute strike with goals from Miguel Almiron, Callum Wilson and then a stunning free kick from Kieran Trippier in the 54th.
Rather than opt for damage limitation, Newcastle — inspired by the individual brilliance of Allan Saint-Maximin — decided attack was the best form of defense and it nearly paid off.
Ultimately it was a goal by Silva, starting for the first time in the league this season after being linked with a move to Barcelona in the summer, that saved City and it came off a brilliant through-ball from Kevin De Bruyne that took out three Newcastle players — going through the legs of one of them.
Newcastle also stayed unbeaten after three games and, funded by the riches of Saudi Arabia, will be proud of a statement display against the champions.
City started strongly, and Silva and Haaland had already combined ominously to allow Rodri to whistle a long-range strike over Nick Pope’s crossbar when the midfielder was allowed time and space to deliver a cross for Gundogan to control and fire past Pope.
The England goalkeeper had to save with his legs from De Bruyne and Phil Foden in quick succession with the visitors utterly dominant, although the home side should have leveled when Saint-Maximin cut the ball back for Almiron, who skied his shot.
Then Newcastle took over. Ederson had to save at full stretch to keep out Saint-Maximin before substitute Ruben Dias — on for the injured Nathan Ake — deflected Wilson’s attempt wide.
The respite proved temporary. Saint-Maximin tricked his way past Kyle Walker and Rodri down the left to cross to the far post where Almiron slid in to turn the ball home. The goal was ruled offside but it was overturned on review.
That Almiron was the scorer was poignant, given he was mocked by City midfielder Jack Grealish in post-title celebrations in May.
Joao Cancelo had to come to Ederson’s rescue after he had rashly raced from his line to confront Almiron and was easily rounded, but the Brazil goalkeeper was picking the ball out of his net once again six minutes before the break. Saint-Maximin cut inside and fed Wilson, who touched the ball back inside past Dias before dispatching it into the net with the outside of his right foot.
Haaland was unfortunate not to drag the visitors back level within seven minutes of the restart when his shot was tipped onto the foot of a post by Pope, and his misery was compounded two minutes later when the home side extended their lead.
John Stones was penalized for bringing down the flying Saint-Maximin 22 meters out and Trippier’s free kick gave Ederson little chance.
Haaland blasted City back into it from close range from Rodri’s flick back into the area and should have helped himself to a second three minutes later, but was denied by Pope’s legs.
City was level, however, seconds later when De Bruyne picked out Silva’s run.
Trippier was shown a straight red card by referee Jarred Gillett for a cynical trip on De Bruyne, but the official was advised to review the incident and reduced the punishment to a yellow.

A bad error by goalkeeper Edouard Mendy prompted a collapse by Chelsea in a 3-0 loss at Leeds on Sunday featuring a first Premier League goal by American winger Brenden Aaronson.
The late sending-off of center back Kalidou Koulibaly completed a miserable afternoon at a lively Elland Road for Chelsea, which fell to a first loss of the season.
It was Aaronson who applied pressure on Mendy after the Senegal international received a back pass in the 33rd minute. Mendy took a slightly heavy touch and tried to go around Aaronson, who dispossessed him and walked the ball into the net to make it 1-0.
Rodrigo glanced home a header from Jack Harrison’s free kick in the 37th minute and the roles were reversed for the third goal in the 69th, when Rodrigo arrived in the area to meet a cross with a mis-hit shot that was turned in from close range by Harrison.
Koulibaly, one of Chelsea’s offseason signings, received his second yellow card in the 84th for pulling back the jersey of substitute Joe Gelhardt.
Chelsea’s poor performance contrasted sharply with its impressive display in a 2-2 draw with Tottenham last weekend and highlighted a number of weaknesses in its squad.
Notably in attack, where manager Thomas Tuchel looks to be short after letting go Romelu Lukaku and Timo Werner and only bringing in Raheem Sterling from Manchester City. Sterling had a goal disallowed in the first half and also missed a great early chance.
Chelsea also has a shortage of center backs — the suspension of Koulibaly won’t help — as well as issues in midfield, with N’Golo Kante and Mateo Kovacic injured.
Leeds has opened with two wins and a draw in manager Jesse Marsch’s first full season in charge.
Spain striker Rodrigo has four goals, making him the top scorer in the league.

Two glaring misses then a red card for a reckless headbutt.
It was a home debut to forget for Liverpool’s big offseason signing, Darwin Núñez.
Fortunately for the Reds, another South American came to the rescue at Anfield as a dazzling individual goal by Luis Díaz salvaged a 1-1 draw against Crystal Palace in the Premier League on Monday.
In his first competitive start for Liverpool, Núñez lost control after jostling with Joachim Andersen off the ball and thrust his head into the face of the Palace defender, with referee Paul Tierney watching on close by in the 57th minute.
The red card was immediately brandished and Núñez had to be calmed down by his teammates as he attempted to confront Tierney. Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp blanked Núñez as the Uruguay striker headed down the tunnel.
“It’s a red card,” Klopp said. “He was provoked all the time but that is not how to behave.”
Núñez, an offseason signing from Benfica, earned his first start after a couple of impressive, goalscoring displays off the bench in the Community Shield against Manchester City and then against Fulham, and also because Roberto Firmino was missing through injury.
He missed a very presentable early chance against Palace by miscuing a close-range volley at the back post, and then hit the post from a similar range in the final minute of the first half.
Maybe some frustration had set by the time he was red-carded. As they jostled at the edge of Palace’s penalty area, Núñez threw his head back at Andersen and missed. Then, when confronted moments later by the aggrieved defender, Núñez turned into Andersen and butted him square in the face.
Already trailing because of Wilfried Zaha’s 32nd-minute goal, Liverpool was really up against it. But even down to 10 men, Klopp’s team still dominated possession and Díaz earned his team a point by cutting in from the left, slipping between two defenders, and curling a shot into the far corner in front of the Kop. The Colombia international’s goal came four minutes after the red card.
“Sometimes you need a moment of brilliance,” Liverpool midfielder James Milner said, “and when you have players like Luis on the pitch, he can create something out of nothing. It was an incredible goal.”
Palace relied almost exclusively on the counterattack throughout the match and it was from that means that Zaha opened the scoring, breaking the offside trap to latch onto Eberechi Eze’s through-ball and curl a finish into the far corner.
Zaha missed a great chance to snatch a win when he stretched to meet a cross late in the game and hit the post.
Liverpool has now drawn its first two games — Klopp’s team was held 2-2 by Fulham in the opening weekend — and is already four points behind Manchester City and Arsenal, the early pacesetters.
Its third match will be at Old Trafford next Monday against a beleaguered Manchester United team that has lost both of its games.
Núñez will be suspended for that, while Klopp is set to be without a slew of key players, with the likes of Thiago Alcantara, Diogo Jota, Ibrahima Konaté and Joel Matip currently out injured. Firmino missed the game as a precaution, according to Liverpool, so could be fit in a week’s time.
“Everything went against us during the week,” Klopp said. “It was crazy — it was like a witch was in the building. Every time somebody else had problems and then putting in such a performance, especially in the circumstances, I’m really proud.”

Antonio Conte and Thomas Tuchel were both sent off after clashing following the final whistle of a feisty 2-2 draw between Chelsea and Tottenham featuring an equalizer in the sixth minute of stoppage time by Spurs striker Harry Kane on Sunday.
As they shook hands on the field, Tuchel seemed to not let go of his grip and intimated that Conte look him in the eyes. Pushing and shoving ensued, just as there had been between the two managers in the technical area during the match at Stamford Bridge. They were then shown red cards.
Conte celebrated Tottenham’s first equalizer, by Pierre-Emile Højbjerg in the 68th minute, by barging into the chest of Tuchel, sparking a melee among the two sets of coaching staff.
Then, after Reece James put Chelsea back in front in the 77th, Tuchel set off on a sprint past Conte and down the touchline, clenching his fist in pure delight.
Kane’s goal came in the sixth of seven added-on minutes, the striker glancing in a header that took a touch off the thigh of James before going into the net.
Kalidou Koulibaly had put Chelsea ahead in the 19th minute by meeting a deep corner from Marc Cucurella with a stunning volley that flew high into the net for his first goal since joining in the offseason from Napoli.
Tottenham, which only came to life after the introduction of Richarlison, ended a run of five straight losses to Chelsea in all competitions but remained stuck on just one victory at Stamford Bridge since the Premier League started in 1992.
Both teams have four points from two games.

Manchester United plumbed new depths with a 4-0 loss at Brentford on Saturday to send Erik ten Hag’s team into meltdown after just two games of the Premier League season.
Through a mixture of defensive ineptitude and Brentford’s opportunism, United was 4-0 down at halftime for the first time in a Premier League game.
Mistakes by goalkeeper David De Gea gifted the first two goals to Josh Dasilva and Mathias Jensen, Ben Mee nodded in the third at a corner and Bryan Mbeumo hit a slick fourth on the counterattack on a chastening afternoon for the visitors.
Ten Hag, who joined from Ajax in the offseason, had insisted before the game that he was not panicking despite United’s lack of new signings but the Dutchman must be worried about this humiliating result, coming a week after a 2-1 home loss to Brighton.
It was a defeat largely of United’s own making.
Ten Hag had turned to Cristiano Ronaldo to lead the attack, having started the Portugal star on the bench against Brighton.
But the problems were all at the other end, as United imploded after only 10 minutes thanks to the first mistake from De Gea.
The Spaniard allowed Dasilva’s weak long-range shot to squirm through his hands and roll into the net.
De Gea was at fault again eight minutes later, passing to the under-pressure Christian Eriksen as United attempted to play out from the back.
Jensen was alive to the unravelling situation in the United defense and nipped in to rob Eriksen, cut inside and double the lead.
It was a sweet moment for the Bees fans, with Eriksen having spent the second half of last season with Brentford following his recovery from cardiac arrest, only to opt for supposed bigger and better things at United.
It certainly does not look like panning out that way for the Denmark international just yet.
The drinks break in sweltering conditions gave Ten Hag the chance to try to sort out the mess unfolding in front of him, while Bees boss Thomas Frank brought out a tactics board.
There was no change and on the half hour, Mee, an offseason signing from Burnley, bundled in a header at the far post after United failed to deal with a corner headed back into the danger area by Ivan Toney.
Five minutes later, Toney was given space to race forward down the left and tee up strike partner Mbeumo, who beat Luke Shaw before firing home.
With the heat undoubtedly a factor, United got some respite in the second half and Eriksen managed a couple of attempts on goal — a header held by goalkeeper David Raya and a volley skewed wide — both to loud cheers from the partying Brentford fans.

Gabriel Jesus didn’t take long to make an impression at the Emirates stadium.
The Brazil striker marked his home debut for Arsenal with two goals and two assists in a 4-2 win against Leicester in the Premier League on Saturday.
Jesus, who joined from Manchester City as Arsenal’s marquee summer signing so far, opened his account for the Gunners in the 23rd minute with a brilliant, curling finish. He got his second in the 35th from a header and had several chances to finish the game at Emirates Stadium with a hat trick.
The two times Leicester found itself back in the match, Arsenal responded right away.
The visitors made it 2-1 from an own goal by William Saliba in the 53rd, but Arsenal midfielder Granit Xhaka restored the home side’s two-goal cushion two minutes later. Xhaka scored after Jesus poked a loose ball into his path after Leicester goalkeeper Danny Ward failed to hold on to a routine cross into the box and collided with defender Wesley Fofana.
Leicester attacking midfielder James Maddison made it 3-2 in the 74th when he sent a low shot through the legs of Arsenal goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale.
A nervous murmur went through the crowd, but the Arsenal team didn’t panic as it did in similar situations in recent seasons. Jesus drove forward just a minute later and squared the ball to forward Gabriel Martinelli, who fired a left-footed shot from just outside the area to beat Ward at the back post to make it 4-2.
Leicester also had a penalty decision overturned just before halftime after the referee first pointed to the spot and then was asked to review a coming together of Ramsdale and Leicester forward Jamie Vardy in the box.
On a hot day when the mercury hit around 33 C (91 F), six goals and the pace of the game took a lot out of the players and water breaks were needed in each half. The result means that Arsenal has won both of its opening league games, with Leicester drawing its first match.
Jesus was the focus of Arsenal’s attack throughout the match, with teammates trying to get him the ball at every opportunity. For his first goal, he took one touch after receiving a pass from Xhaka, set himself and then bent a shot that took a slight deflection to sail in past Ward.
Jesus got a bit of help for his second from Vardy. The Leicester forward flicked the ball backward across the face of goal from a corner, and Jesus headed into an empty net at the back post.
The striker nearly scored a hat trick before halftime when he dominated Leicester defender Jonny Evans with his back to goal, spun around him into the box and fired a low shot saved by Ward. He had multiple chances in the second half as well.
Unlike Arsenal, Leicester has been very quiet in the transfer market. The team only announced its first signing of the transfer window on the eve of Saturday’s match. Alex Smithies, a 32-year-old backup goalkeeper who most recently played for Cardiff, signed with the Foxes on a two-year deal.

Erling Haaland might not hog all of Manchester City’s goals this season, after all.
Ilkay Gundogan, Kevin De Bruyne and Phil Foden were City’s scorers — along with an own-goal — in a 4-0 win over Bournemouth in the Premier League on Saturday, with Haaland barely getting a sight on goal at Etihad Stadium.
The Norway striker scored both of City’s goals in its opening-weekend 2-0 win at West Ham but was mostly crowded out a week later as Bournemouth sat deep with plenty of men behind the ball in a match that resembled an attack vs defense training exercise.
City’s midfielders reaped the benefits of the extra focus on Haaland.
Gundogan’s goal did involve City’s new star striker, with Haaland holding off his marker with his back to goal and clipping a ball through to the Germany midfielder. Gundogan’s left-footed finish found the bottom corner in the 19th for his 50th goal for City.
De Bruyne scored the pick of the goals, the playmaker cutting inside on a counterattack led by Foden in the 31st, beating a defender and bending his shot with the outside of his right foot into the far corner.
De Bruyne returned the favor for Foden six minutes later, slipping a brilliant pass through the legs of a defender and into the path of his teammate, who took a touch and fired in a deflected shot that beat goalkeeper Mark Travers.
Haaland’s best chance fell in the 73rd when he mishit a first-time shot wide from Jack Grealish’s cut-back. The striker was substituted moments later.
The scoring was completed by Jefferson Lerma, who unwittingly turned a cross from Joao Cancelo into his own net from inside Bournemouth’s six-yard box.
It was a wake-up call for Bournemouth after the promoted team started the season with a surprisingly comfortable 2-0 win over Aston Villa last weekend.
City manager Pep Guardiola again chose to start with Bernardo Silva on the bench. The Portugal midfielder has been linked with a move to Barcelona and didn’t start against West Ham, either.

Industry Minister Gajendra Hamal has resigned 40 hours after appointment. Hamal has said he has resigned listening to his conscience after widespread criticism of the appointment. Baluwatar has tried to spin the resignation by Hamal of his own volition to save its face. The press note issued by Baluwatar mentions that Hamal has resigned on request of Prime Minister (PM) Sher Bahadur Deuba even as audio recording of Hamal requesting to broadcast/publish the issue through the media pointing that Deuba may reject his resignation has been made public.
One fact has been irrefutably established despite all the efforts of damage control by Baluwatar. The democracy in Nepal has been attacked in an unimaginable manner last week.
Politicians and people in the judiciary can some time commit mistakes in course of work and do work that should not be done. But the deed of PM Deuba and Chief Justice (CJ) Cholendra Shumsher Rana with consent of the top leaders of ruling coalition is an unthinkable crime in democracy. CJ seeking share of spoils in the government and the ruling parties accepting that is unimaginable in democracy.
The main source of this misdeed is CJ Rana, and his unconstitutional aspirations. Rana had the temerity to seek a share in power violating the sanctity of judiciary believing he can do anything he wishes.
The ruling coalition should have strongly resisted this impudence by CJ Rana. But the coalition easily accepted his demand reflecting at once the gratitude of the coalition toward some of the past verdicts by CJ and fear that he may put the government in another crisis.
Rana has been enjoying the fallout of the havoc he has wreaked from the sacred chair of CJ and making mockery of democracy. It is not hard to see that Rana has been influencing the court’s verdicts in a way that benefits one party or another, and reaping political benefits for that.
Two major verdicts by the Supreme Court (SC) in cases related to political parties are now under suspicion. The SC verdict to revoke unification of CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Center) restoring the two parties to the state before unification in a case related to the unified party using name of another registered party was against the Constitution, laws and jurisdiction of the judiciary. That verdict was unimaginable.  
The refusal by the SC to issue an interim order in the case against the ordinance making splitting of parties easier issued hastily by the Deuba government after suddenly ending the House session, and subsequent delay in issuing final verdict in the case have also raised suspicions. Every government has undermined the parliament by bringing ordinance and tampered with laws for its vested interests. There will be no meaning of democratic norms of the people’s representatives formulating laws and the rule of law if that is not controlled.
The SC recently had revoked the ordinance brought by the KP Oli government to amend the act related to citizenship immediately after dissolving the House. The court had done a commendable job of curbing the autocratic tendency of the executive to rule through ordinances by avoiding the parliament. The final verdict in that case would have set a good precedent and curbed abuse of powers bolstering democracy and rule of law.
But the SC has again treaded the wrong path in the case related to the ordinance about splitting of parties. The SC has blatantly ignored the precedent it established in the ordinance related to citizenship. The double standard of the Apex Court in cases related to two similar ordinances has not just hit the credibility of the judiciary but raised suspicions that CJ Rana influences court verdicts to serve his immoral interests in connivance with political parties. CJ Rana has himself proved the suspicions to be true by accepting his share in Cabinet expansion.
Opposing such immoral acts of CJ is not opposing the judiciary or attacking the dignity of the court. The judiciary is not an individual justice or CJ, for that matter, who does not remain within the limits and disregards the sanctity of the judiciary.
Condemning such justices rather saves the judiciary and all those honest justices who continuously work with constitutional integrity and cannot even think about treading the path Rana has taken. Slamming Rana will save the justices who twice revived the House dissolved unconstitutionally by Oli going against Rana’s wishes. Criticizing Rana will safeguard the public trust over those very justices who have not participated in the political dealmaking of Rana.
We should not forget here that CJ Rana agreed to reinstate the House for the first time only after three justices in the five-strong constitutional bench stood for House reinstatement. Two justices refused to stay in the constitutional bench formed by CJ Rana in the case against the second dissolution by Oli. The rest of the justices then forced Rana to constitute the bench on the basis of seniority. The constitutional bench formed on the basis of seniority then reinstated the House.  
The current transgression by Rana has provided an opportunity to UML leaders to claim that the verdict for House reinstatement was also given on the basis of political machination. Rana in this way has not just dragged other SC justices working with honesty and integrity into suspicion but also gravely reduced the credibility of the judiciary.
CJ Rana would have deserved impeachment if politicians at the top were not complicit in such grave crimes. Merely demanding share in government would be sufficient to impeach a CJ in a well-functioning democracy. But our politicians are so lowly and decadent that they are condemned to fulfilling the quota demanded by CJ in appointments in the government and constitutional bodies. Oli gave Rana share in appointments in constitutional bodies when he was PM. Deuba gave Rana a share even in the Cabinet this time.
Our politicians will not muster moral courage to impeach Rana due to this background. The responsibility to resist the immoral deeds of Rana is now on the judiciary itself. The SC justices, the Nepal Bar Association, and the SC Bar Association must seriously carry out consultations. Such incidents erode the legitimacy of democracy and undermine rule of law, and the courageous stand of people with integrity and honesty at such times will instill life in democracy and save democracy.
Nepali Congress (NC) that considers itself to be the mother of parliamentary democracy in Nepal and its leaders and cadres also have a huge responsibility. Maoist Center Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who does not respect or believe in parliamentary democracy a bit, defending Hamal’ appointment is not surprising because he believes all the means toward climbing to power and staying are fair. But NC leaders and cadres should seriously contemplate whether corruption of the executive by an immoral and whimsical CJ is acceptable in parliamentary democracy or not? Whether the party president who has committed such a grave attack and crime against democracy is acceptable or not? Whether the party president can continue to lead the party and government in the coming days or not? Why should the Nepali people bear with Deuba who undermines democracy, Constitution and the party ideals every time he reaches power even if the party leaders and cadres consider him fit to be party president? Why should NC under Deuba again be sent to the government?
The coming days will show how people in the judiciary retaliate against CJ’s arbitrariness or those in NC will resist Deuba. But one thing is absolutely clear. Deuba and Rana, and not Hamal, are the ones who should be punished in this episode. The attack on democracy by PM Deuba and CJ Rana, who have repeatedly failed to maintain clean image even in the past, this time has plummeted their image to the nadir of ignominy. History will not absolve them of this ignominy.

But the deed of PM Deuba and Chief Justice (CJ) Cholendra Shumsher Rana with consent of the top leaders of ruling coalition is an unthinkable crime in democracy. CJ seeking share of spoils in the government and the ruling parties accepting that is unimaginable in democracy.
The main source of this misdeed is CJ Rana, and his unconstitutional aspirations. Rana had the temerity to seek a share in power violating the sanctity of judiciary believing he can do anything he wishes.
The ruling coalition should have strongly resisted this impudence by CJ Rana. But the coalition easily accepted his demand reflecting at once the gratitude of the coalition toward some of the past verdicts by CJ and fear that he may put the government in another crisis.
Rana has been enjoying the fallout of the havoc he has wreaked from the sacred chair of CJ and making mockery of democracy. It is not hard to see that Rana has been influencing the court’s verdicts in a way that benefits one party or another, and reaping political benefits for that.
Two major verdicts by the Supreme Court (SC) in cases related to political parties are now under suspicion. The SC verdict to revoke unification of CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Center) restoring the two parties to the state before unification in a case related to the unified party using name of another registered party was against the Constitution, laws and jurisdiction of the judiciary. That verdict was unimaginable.  
The refusal by the SC to issue an interim order in the case against the ordinance making splitting of parties easier issued hastily by the Deuba government after suddenly ending the House session, and subsequent delay in issuing final verdict in the case have also raised suspicions. Every government has undermined the parliament by bringing ordinance and tampered with laws for its vested interests. There will be no meaning of democratic norms of the people’s representatives formulating laws and the rule of law if that is not controlled.
The SC recently had revoked the ordinance brought by the KP Oli government to amend the act related to citizenship immediately after dissolving the House. The court had done a commendable job of curbing the autocratic tendency of the executive to rule through ordinances by avoiding the parliament. The final verdict in that case would have set a good precedent and curbed abuse of powers bolstering democracy and rule of law.
But the SC has again treaded the wrong path in the case related to the ordinance about splitting of parties. The SC has blatantly ignored the precedent it established in the ordinance related to citizenship. The double standard of the Apex Court in cases related to two similar ordinances has not just hit the credibility of the judiciary but raised suspicions that CJ Rana influences court verdicts to serve his immoral interests in connivance with political parties. CJ Rana has himself proved the suspicions to be true by accepting his share in Cabinet expansion.
Opposing such immoral acts of CJ is not opposing the judiciary or attacking the dignity of the court. The judiciary is not an individual justice or CJ, for that matter, who does not remain within the limits and disregards the sanctity of the judiciary.
Condemning such justices rather saves the judiciary and all those honest justices who continuously work with constitutional integrity and cannot even think about treading the path Rana has taken. Slamming Rana will save the justices who twice revived the House dissolved unconstitutionally by Oli going against Rana’s wishes. Criticizing Rana will safeguard the public trust over those very justices who have not participated in the political dealmaking of Rana.
We should not forget here that CJ Rana agreed to reinstate the House for the first time only after three justices in the five-strong constitutional bench stood for House reinstatement. Two justices refused to stay in the constitutional bench formed by CJ Rana in the case against the second dissolution by Oli. The rest of the justices then forced Rana to constitute the bench on the basis of seniority. The constitutional bench formed on the basis of seniority then reinstated the House.  
The current transgression by Rana has provided an opportunity to UML leaders to claim that the verdict for House reinstatement was also given on the basis of political machination. Rana in this way has not just dragged other SC justices working with honesty and integrity into suspicion but also gravely reduced the credibility of the judiciary.
CJ Rana would have deserved impeachment if politicians at the top were not complicit in such grave crimes. Merely demanding share in government would be sufficient to impeach a CJ in a well-functioning democracy. But our politicians are so lowly and decadent that they are condemned to fulfilling the quota demanded by CJ in appointments in the government and constitutional bodies. Oli gave Rana share in appointments in constitutional bodies when he was PM. Deuba gave Rana a share even in the Cabinet this time.
Our politicians will not muster moral courage to impeach Rana due to this background. The responsibility to resist the immoral deeds of Rana is now on the judiciary itself. The SC justices, the Nepal Bar Association, and the SC Bar Association must seriously carry out consultations. Such incidents erode the legitimacy of democracy and undermine rule of law, and the courageous stand of people with integrity and honesty at such times will instill life in democracy and save democracy.
Nepali Congress (NC) that considers itself to be the mother of parliamentary democracy in Nepal and its leaders and cadres also have a huge responsibility. Maoist Center Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who does not respect or believe in parliamentary democracy a bit, defending Hamal’ appointment is not surprising because he believes all the means toward climbing to power and staying are fair. But NC leaders and cadres should seriously contemplate whether corruption of the executive by an immoral and whimsical CJ is acceptable in parliamentary democracy or not? Whether the party president who has committed such a grave attack and crime against democracy is acceptable or not? Whether the party president can continue to lead the party and government in the coming days or not? Why should the Nepali people bear with Deuba who undermines democracy, Constitution and the party ideals every time he reaches power even if the party leaders and cadres consider him fit to be party president? Why should NC under Deuba again be sent to the government?
The coming days will show how people in the judiciary retaliate against CJ’s arbitrariness or those in NC will resist Deuba. But one thing is absolutely clear. Deuba and Rana, and not Hamal, are the ones who should be punished in this episode. The attack on democracy by PM Deuba and CJ Rana, who have repeatedly failed to maintain clean image even in the past, this time has plummeted their image to the nadir of ignominy. History will not absolve them of this ignominy.

Kathmandu Mayor Balen Shah has issued instruction to not pick garbage from the Singha Durbar and the Shital Niwas from Saturday. Waste materials are starting to pile up at the country’s administrative center and other sensitive areas of the state after his instruction to Paribartan Nepal, a private company that has been collecting garbage.  
“Garbage of Singha Durbar will not be picked from today. Leaders there will have to be dumped at Sisdole if the country really has to be cleaned,” Shah had posted on Facebook Saturday to inform about stopping garbage collection.
Both the expression and the deed of Shah are irresponsible and anarchic.
Those in public position should not just fulfill their responsibilities but also maintain decorum of their post. They should also think about dignity of others. What does he actually mean by ‘leaders from Singha Durbar will have to be dumped at Sisdole if the country really has to be cleaned’? This is absolutely anarchic and apolitical expression in itself. This says more about Shah himself than other leaders.
Leaders, whether seated at the Singha Durbar or the Bag Durbar, have both strengths and weaknesses. People have elected them to their respective posts expecting them to resolve the country’s problems remaining within their limits and maintaining dignity.
Shah seems to suffer from this mental illness that only he is right and all the others deserve to be dumped at Sisdole. He can criticize the works of others and also recommend to work in a certain manner. He can offer support but cannot run away from his responsibilities by abusing and blaming others.
He posted a defense of his decision to not pick garbage from the Singha Durbar on Monday listing the works in which 14 ministries of the federal government did not cooperate with him. The majority of the issues he has raised are beyond his jurisdiction. He has stake in them in capacity of a citizen and a mayor, and can also speak about them or provide suggestion. But he cannot stop picking of garbage from the Prime Minister’s Office and the President’s Office citing lack of cooperation by others in issues not in his jurisdiction.  
Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) not picking garbage from the Prime Minister’s Office and the President’s Office is as unimaginable and irresponsible as the federal government stopping budget allocated for the KMC or not sending staffers citing lack of support from mayor.
Let us look at some of the issues he says that the federal government has not cooperated on. He has said that he met different ministers once or twice and talked about issues ranging from the program of bringing Melamchi water round the year to Kathmandu by connecting Yangri and Larke rivers to Melamchi to management of Melamchi water and pipeline, appropriate management of the Kathmandu Upatyaka Khanepani Limited (KUKL), procurement of fertilizers for the farmers, cooperative regulations and laws, expansion of the Ring Road, sanitation of public hospitals, insurance, implementation of the Supreme Court (SC) order to demolish the top story of the Health Ministry, and even passing the map of airport.
He has stated that he reached the conclusion to not pick garbage from the Singha Durbar as the problems have not been resolved and there was no appropriate coordination despite his efforts for nine months.
Some of the issues and works he has raised may be of concern for him but definitely not in his jurisdiction. Those problems will not be resolved merely after him meeting the ministers and talking with them. The line ministries and government bodies work in their own manner and there may be dalliance and lack of appropriate coordination in some of those works. There may even be corruption in some of those works. But that all comes down to the capacity of our overall state system. That is precisely why we are in the current state.
If a mere meeting of the mayor with the ministers were to resolve those problems, they would not have remained unresolved until now in the first place. There is an error in the thinking that problems remain only because nobody wants them resolved. To think all seated at the Singha Durbar are crooks and say that they deserve to be dumped at Sisdole is his hubris and madness. 
Why many problems that the KMC can resolve on its own remain as they were if the problems facing the country could be resolved magically as he seems to think or if mere good intentions were to suffice? Has the KMC completed all the works that it can do on its own?
The KMC has not been able to resolve many problems that many other metropolitan cities have resolved.
Let us look at a small example. There is problem of squatters in almost all the metropolitan cities of the country. There are genuine and fake squatters in all metropolitan cities. It is necessary to first ascertain who out of them are genuine squatters and who are not to resolve the problem. Record must be collected by going to the squatter settlements for that. It is the responsibility of the metropolitan cities to do that. The state has formulated a policy to address those identified as genuine squatters in that manner. The state accepts that it has responsibility toward them. It is basic responsibility of the state even from the perspective of social justice. Many metropolitan cities have moved forward toward resolving the problem after collecting record of squatters but the KMC is not ready to collect record of squatters. It contends that all of them are encroachers and their record, therefore, should not be collected. Shah stresses on removing them even at the cost of a bloody clash deploying excavators and the police. He has made many attempts to that regard. The KMC has been forced to take a step back after clash with the squatters on each occasion.
His main gripe with the Singha Durbar is lack of mobilization of police to exercise force on the squatters. A civilized state that believes in social justice never can, and should, support him in this wrong objective.  
Mayor Balen Shah suffers from this attitude that all he thinks and believes in is right, and all others think and believe in is wrong, and only he is right and all others are wrong. His prescription of dumping all others at Sisdole to develop the country is manifestation of that attitude.
KMC is not just Balen Shah. It also has other elected representatives. He seems to have unilaterally taken the decision to not pick garbage from the Singha Durbar and the Shital Niwas without consulting anyone.  Deputy mayor and the ward chair concerned have confirmed that the mayor’s decision was made without informing them. The other elected people’s representatives of KMC also cannot evade this issue now. They must speak clearly whether what he has done is right or wrong. They must form a position as to whether to do so in the pretext of cooperation from the federal government is right or not.
Let us assume that the Prime Minister’s Office and the ministries actually did not cooperate. Why drag the office of the constitutional president in this? How is the office of the head of state connected to this? Why was the prestige of that office not considered even a bit?
 Let the other elected representatives of KMC and the federal government speak clearly to Mayor Shah. Let the federal government immediately provide support and coordination it can in the works of KMC. Not just the KMC but even other local bodies and provincial government have been facing obstruction in their works in lack of necessary laws and downward delegation of the rights. Let the federal government work for resolving that as soon as possible.
Let everyone remind Mayor Balen Shah of his limits, the dignity and responsibilities of mayoralty; tell him that federal, provincial and local governments must move forward with mutual support, coordination and cooperation; and remind him that problems cannot be resolved by blaming and abusing one another.

Who are the 4,000 or so persons that CPN (Maoist Center) wants to pay Rs 200,000 each to from the state coffers?
The Maoists claim that these 4,000 persons are combatants who participated in the armed conflict. They were due financial package as per the spirit of the peace agreement. But they were not provided the package by labeling them disqualified on different pretexts and they suffered injustice. They could neither be integrated in the Nepal Army (NA) nor were paid by the state. It is, therefore, necessary to pay them even 15 years after the peace agreement as per the spirit of the peace process.
The Cabinet meeting on March 20 decided to provide Rs 200,000 each to them and has sent the decision to the Home Ministry. Home Secretary Binod Prakash Singh has told the Rastriya Samachar Samiti that the ministry is preparing a working procedure for distributing the money.
Some of the Nepali Congress (NC) leaders say that they have been told by Prime Minister (PM) Pushpa Kamal Dahal that such a decision has not been taken. PM Dahal himself, however, has not spoken publicly about the issue. It can, therefore, be understood that the process of distributing relief has moved forward.
Are the 4,000 persons that the Maoists want to pay with the taxpayers’ money really combatants? We have to look at the background of the peace process to understand that.
The seven political parties and the Maoists on November 8, 2006 had agreed to keep Maoist combatants in the main cantonments at Kailali, Surkhet, Rolpa, Palpa, Kavre, Sindhuli and Ilam districts, and that the combatants would be verified and monitored by the UN to hold peaceful and fair Constituent Assembly Election without any fear, and democratization and restructuring of the Nepal Army as per the spirit of the 12-point agreement, 8-point agreement, 25-point code of conduct, and the five-point letter sent to the UN on August 9, 2006.
The peace agreement signed on November 21, 2006 after that had agreed to keep the Maoist combatants and their weapons in the cantonments.
The agreement for monitoring of management of the weapons and combatants on December 6, 2006 then set standards for Maoist combatants. A person must have joined the Maoists before May 25, 2006, and be born before May 25, 1988 to qualify as a combatant during the verification process.
The cut-off date of birth was kept to be prior to May 25, 1988 to ensure that they would have completed at least 18 years on the cut-off date for joining the Maoist army.  An agreement, in other words, was reached that a minor younger than 18 years would not be recognized as a combatant. Using child soldiers in war is a crime even under international laws which deem those leading such wars to have committed a crime.
The Maoists sent a total of 32,350 persons to seven main cantonments and 21 sub-cantonments spread across the country saying they were combatants after the agreement for monitoring of management of the weapons and combatants on December 6, 2006.
The United Nations Mission in Nepal (UNMIN) then started the verification process to determine who out of them were combatants, and who were not. Most of them were not combatants and had left the cantonments even before verification.    
A total of 8,640 of those in the cantonments did not even turn up for the second stage of interview for verification of combatants.
UNMIN finally verified 19,602 of them to be combatants. Only 17,076 of them were present in the first stage of reclassification.
A total of 15,630 Maoist combatants then opted for voluntary retirement and returned home with Rs 500,000-800,000 while 1,422 were integrated in the Nepal Army. The 4,008 persons who UNMIN verified were not combatants left the cantonments without any payment. Because no agreement said that they would be paid after being found that they were not combatants.
How had they reached the cantonments then?
The number of combatants who had fought in the Maoist armed conflict was actually very low. A video of Maoist supremo Dahal talking about the numbers during a speech in the Shaktikhor cantonment had become public back then. Dahal had conceded in Shaktikhor that the Maoists actually had only around 7,000 combatants and taken pride in having been able to keep 30,000-35,000 persons in the cantonments fooling the state.   
The 4,008 expelled by UNMIN included their thousands of cadres and their children who were sent to the cantonments by the Maoists saying they would get relief package from the state.
Many of those 4,008 expelled by UNMIN saying they were not combatants had not completed 18 years until May 25, 2006. A total of 1,973 were below 18 years while 1,035 others could not prove that they had joined the Maoist army before the cut-off date of May 25, 2006 for joining the Maoist army even though they had completed 18.
UNMIN did not even investigate whether the 1,973 minors had joined the Maoist army or not. It first investigated age, and said that those who were underage were not eligible to become combatants without checking when they had been recruited.
It was difficult to go there even for UNMIN because verifying that child soldiers were recruited by the Maoists would have meant that the Maoist leadership had committed the crime of using child soldiers. That would have attracted international laws. UNMIN, therefore, did not venture there, and the Maoist leadership was freed from the accusation of using child soldiers for then.
If the Maoist leadership now insists that they were indeed combatants and participated in the armed conflict and hence should be compensated, that would establish that the Maoists had used child soldiers in the conflict. Is the Maoist leadership ready to face the consequences of accepting to have used child soldiers in the conflict?
UNMIN had not strictly investigated even the adult combatants then. Those who could answer a few simple questions were verified to be combatants. Over 19,000 were, therefore, verified to be combatants even though Dahal had conceded in the Shaktikhor video that the Maoists actually had only around 7,000 combatants. The state spent around Rs 20 billion in their management and integration. There was embezzlement of billions in the name of running the Maoist cantonments. The advance of Rs 460 million taken by Maoist leader Krishna Bahadur Mahara for the combatants at cantonments was never reimbursed.
Everyone turned a blind eye to that to establish peace in the country and bring the Maoists into the mainstream. How necessary that was would perhaps be evaluated by history.
But the way the Maoists have continued their efforts to dole out taxpayers’ money to their cadres even after joining mainstream politics and 16 years after the peace deal is condemnable.
This is not the first time that attempts have ben made to give those 4,000 persons Rs 200,000 each. The Maoists had first made the attempt in 2012 when its leader Baburam Bhattarai was PM. It was made again when there was a coalition government including CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Center) in 2016.
Finance Minister Bishnu Paudel in the then KP Sharma Oli government had allocated Rs 840 million to pay Rs 200,000 each to the disqualified combatants and to those who had opted for voluntary retirement but had not received the lump sum in the budget for the fiscal year 2073/74.
That distribution was stopped when a few NC cadres and conflict victims moved the Supreme Court (SC) against the decision.
Dahal has now become PM for the third time. It has already been 15 years since he first became PM. It may not have been unnatural for him to have more rebellious attitude and less responsibility toward the state. But the determination showed by Dahal to try to pay his cadres from the state coffers when he has become PM for the third time is irresponsible. It shows that he has failed to understand the sensitivity of current times and his responsibility toward the general public.
The country is currently in a difficult economic situation. Not only Nepal, the whole world is affected by recession. In South Asia, all countries except India are going through a difficult economic situation. Those countries, including Nepal, have taken assistance from the International Monetary Fund to sustain the economy.
The recession has also affected the market and the general public. Many businesses have not been able to pay salaries on time. Many have furloughed their staff. The businesses themselves are in a tight spot as they are not able to pay the bank’s interest. Then there’s the mental stress of those with fixed income who have to pay installments to banks. The government has not been able to collect revenues due to the recession. If the situation worsens further, a situation could arise where it would be difficult to provide salaries to employees and to service debts.
What message will it send to the general public when the PM wants to dole out nearly a billion rupees from the state coffers to his cadres in the name of combatants at a time when he should be leading the job of extricating the country from this economic challenge?
What do coalition partner NC and NC leaders who are ironing their daura-suruwals to join the government say about it? On what basis will NC, which was against it when it was in the opposition in the past, support it now? Maybe it will now be opposed by UML, which had tried to provide Rs 200,000 each to these 4,000 people to appease the Maoists by including it in the budget itself. Trust in parties has deteriorated almost to a point of no return because of this double standard.
Let’s call a spade a spade, whether in the government or in the opposition.
The Maoists won’t be able to justify in any way the rationale behind their plan to distribute the tax money collected from the public’s hard work to their cadres. There has been no agreement in the past to provide money from the state coffers to those who were not combatants. The Maoists should put a stop to such attempts at recklessly imposing a burden on the state coffers and splurging on its cadres in the name of peace agreement.

Parliamentary system, they say, gives two governments to the voters at one go: one is the government that takes over the reins of power and the other the government-in-waiting.
The government that takes over power performs in accordance with the commitments made to the people. The parliamentary system expects that the government works for the people and their benefits.
But the parties that assume powers do not necessarily always abide by these democratic ideals. They often don't do so going by our own experience. The government has its own interests and compulsions, and the leaders of the parties also have their own agendas and interests. They often put their own agendas above the interests of the people and the country. The government prevails over the people and their fundamental rights at such times, and tries to curtail the people's rights to serve its own interests.
The voters in parliamentary democracy, therefore, also elect the main opposition party or the government-in-waiting to stop such despotic whims of the government. Parliamentary system is such a system of balance that puts the strongest party or coalition in power, and the next strongest party in the opposition so that the despotic whims of the government are challenged; it can strongly stand in the House for the people's rights and their daily lives, and compliance of the Constitution and laws to stop those in power from abusing the Constitution and the laws.  
The ruling party also fears the opposition party, aware that it is the government-in-waiting. The ruling party is always alert about the possibility of the people bringing it down from power and putting the main opposition party in power in the next election.
Nepali Congress (NC), which calls itself the defender of parliamentary democracy, has demolished this beautiful balance of power inherent in the parliamentary system.
NC President and Parliamentary Party Leader Sher Bahadur Deuba has shirked the immense role and responsibilities of the main opposition party to participate in the unholy wagering for power. Setopati reminds him that the politicians that run away from the august role of the main opposition leader also do not have any moral grounds to take over the reins of power tomorrow.
Having contested the election forging an electoral alliance with the promise of forming the government from the same coalition, Deuba failed to give the government promised to the people. His greed for power was mainly to blame for the unraveling of that coalition after he broke his promise to make CPN (Maoist Center) Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal prime minister (PM) first and tried to become PM instead, thereby forcing Dahal to take refuge at Balkot. Deuba has again started to wager for power after a new ruling coalition was formed comprising CPN-UML, Maoist Center and five other parties.
Deuba and those close to him seem to have hoped for Maoist support during the presidential election for now, and aspired for eventually breaking the current coalition in the long run. The way in which NC leader Ram Chandra Paudel has openly defended the decision to give vote of confidence to Dahal hints as much. The way Paudel has been abandoning his ideals for personal interests in recent times is appalling.
Dahal also seems to want to have the cake and eat it too by acquiring support from the two parties larger than his. He reached Deuba's new residence at Dhumbarahi after going to KP Sharma Oli's at Balkot as per that strategy.
It is not hard to see through Dahal's strategy of keeping his post safe scaring Oli by showing Deuba and vice versa. The course of this strategy, however, will end after the presidential election. He must choose one out of NC and UML in the presidential election.    
NC has deviated from the spirit of the parliamentary system of either forming the government or playing a strong role of opposition respecting the people's mandate at a time when the system has come under vehement attack, and the limits and dignity of democracy have been increasingly crossed by everyone.
Our Constitution has not authorized the PM to dissolve the House as long as the final alternative to give the government remains. But Oli twice dissolved the House crossing the limits of the Constitution that he himself prepared with wanton abandon, and the Supreme Court rightly reinstated the House deeming the dissolution unconstitutional on both the occasions.
But Oli shamelessly tried to defend his unconstitutional step of dissolving the House from the rostrum of the very sovereign House on Monday and Tuesday.
On the other hand, President Bidya Devi Bhandari has repeatedly put herself above the Constitution and Parliament. The Constitution has not given her the right to obstruct any work of the Cabinet or defy its decisions. But Bhandari has been sitting on two ordinances passed by the Cabinet. By refusing to authenticate a bill passed by Parliament, she has behaved in a manner to suggest she is above the sovereign Parliament elected by the people.
Oli, who himself flouted the Constitution, and his party have publicly defended the president’s actions. UML has lost the moral right to protest if a president elected with the support of another party were to disobey the decisions of a government under its leadership tomorrow.
The moral turpitude seen in parties who are major proponents of this system and Constitution during such attacks on the Constitution and the system has become a matter of great concern.
Parliamentary system becomes strong only when its major stakeholders agree to stay within its boundaries regardless of whether they are in power or out of power, and when they remain devoted to protecting the essence of the system. Those who are the first to violate the Constitution and break the system at the slightest opportunity are the biggest threat to parliamentary system and this Constitution. Unfortunately, Congress has also joined their ranks today.
Nepali Congress is constantly becoming weaker, both morally and in terms of public support, during the period with the ever power-hungry Deuba as its president.
In the 2017 general election Nepali Congress became the second-largest party in terms of popular votes for the first time in Nepal’s political history. President Deuba defended himself saying UML finished ahead of them on popular votes because of the left alliance even though the popular votes of Nepali Congress had increased.
There was no left alliance in this year’s election. UML had split. CPN (Unified Socialist), which had splintered from UML, received nearly 300,000 votes. But UML still became the largest party in terms of popular votes, finishing ahead of Congress by more than 150,000 votes.
NC has been losing the grounds to form a government on its own in recent times due to gradual erosion of its political base. The grand old party looks doomed to losing even the status of main opposition party looking at the people's revulsion toward the NC leadership and its recent misdeeds.
The lawmakers in the party who have yet to lose conscience must, therefore, seriously review the role of NC. They should play the role of a strong opposition in the House relinquishing the rat race for power in the current difficult situation for the parliamentary system if they have even an iota of historical responsibilities of the party. Play that role for safeguarding the people's rights and their interests, at least conserve a party to pin the people's hopes on if they lose trust in the parties in power to ensure that they don't give up on the parliamentary system.

The people have already elected 165 House of Representatives (HoR) members directly while the process of electing another 110 members through the Proportional Representation (PR) electoral system is in the final stage. A total of 275 elected lawmakers will enter the HoR in a few weeks to formulate laws for the country through periodic election.
The main tenet of democracy is the people legislating for themselves exercising that sovereign right through their representatives.
The elected people's representatives form the government to work for the people and formulate laws to bind that government and the general public. Nobody is above those laws and there is rule of law in the country. The biggest importance and spirit of modern democracy is vested in that.
The gerontocratic leaders of old parties with longevity like that of the sun and the moon who cannot see anything but power and do not care about any norms and limits of democracy have been repeatedly attacking this spirit. This has happened once again.
But the issue is graver than those of yesterday because a new government is going to be formed after the previous mandate expired. New lawmakers have been elected as people's representatives. The government formed as per the previous mandate and already past expiry date has amended an important criminal law through an ordinance with utter disregard for them. The law of the land does not allow the government to withdraw cases of grave crimes sub judice in the court. The court has repeatedly cautioned the government through its orders and verdicts in that regard.
The place to discuss and debate about the matter if someone in special circumstances is hard done by the prevailing laws and court precedents, and to amend them is the House elected by the people. The ordinance brought by the government now, therefore, is not right in the crucible of time, people's mandate, Constitution, laws or political morality. The government should, therefore, take back this ordinance.
There are many dimensions to the issue of 'bringing this ordinance for justice to' Resham Chaudhary, who has been jailed for almost five years, and other political rebels.
First things first, this ordinance has not been brought to ensure justice for Chaudhary. The government could have taken the bill related to the issue to the previous HoR if it genuinely felt that Chaudhary suffered injustice. This government has been in power for around one and a half years and had a clear majority in the previous House. The current ordinance has come as a bargaining tool for power. It has been brought to solicit Chaudhary's support in mustering a majority for the ruling coalition in the newly elected House. This quid pro quo will further complicate the issue of 'injustice' to Chaudhary, and will condemn him to further injustice.
Chaudhary is facing a court case as one of the main accused of the Tikapur incident in which eight police personnel including an SSP of Nepal Police and a toddler were lynched on August 24, 2015. He has been claiming that he was outside Tikapur on that day and he did not have anything to do with the attack on the police.
The then government had formed a judicial commission under former Supreme Court (SC) justice Girish Chandra Lal to find facts about the incident after thorough investigation. And that commission submitted its report almost five years back. The government has changed many times in the intervening period but the government has yet to make that report public.
Chaudhary's supporters claim that the report does not implicate Chaudhary in the Tikapur incident as the court case filed by the government contends, and many feel that he has been unjustly implicated and jailed. The government has supported these claims by not making the report public.
A large chunk of the Tharu community genuinely feels that Chaudhary is suffering injustice due to the shady character of the major political parties that say one thing when they are in power and quite another while in the opposition. This grievance of the Tharu community has manifested in this election. Nagarik Unmukti Party, registered under the leadership of Chaudhary's wife Ranjeeta Shrestha, has won three HoR seats under the First-Past-The-Post (FPTP) electoral system while the party's Lalbir Chaudhary has been elected as an independent candidate from Bardiya-2 after filing rebel candidacy. The party has won 12 seats in the provincial assembly and has secured almost 300,000 votes in the PR electoral system for HoR. This shows the sympathy of the Tharu community toward Resham Chaudhary and the degree of their displeasure toward the case filed against him.
The newly elected House cannot ignore the issue. It is the responsibility of the new House to study the Lal report, explore the additional aspects of the Tikapur incident, and prepare legal grounds and way toward justice for him if it concludes that he indeed has suffered injustice.
The new House can grant justice to Chaudhary in the true sense only by amending the law completing due procedures if he has suffered injustice, and acquit him of the allegations slapped against him. He will be deemed offender by a large chunk of the people if he is released through the ordinance as part of the quid pro quo for the government. That will be a bigger injustice to him. We, therefore, also urge him to not stress on the horse trading for government.
As far as the leaders of the ruling parties are concerned, they have been found repeatedly wanting on the issue of democratic processes and rule of law. Every leader of big parties has made a mockery of rule of law and abused the laws for vested interests while in the government. Ordinance, which is brought at the time of emergency or absence of House for essential works that must be done, has been turned into a tool of rulers for their vested interests.
There are rising aspirations of the people, especially the younger generation, that there is exercise of advanced democracy, rule of law, and democracy does not turn into an armor to cover up the caprices of those in power. The new generation has delivered that very message by establishing new parties in the recent HoR election.
The archaic leaders of the old parties have been repeatedly proving how alienated they are from these aspirations by bringing such ordinances. They will perhaps continue that until they are displaced.

The Election Commission has asked Setopati through an email to remove a news report published on Friday within 24 hours. We had published a news titled ‘Agni Kharel’s son Nishan in US Army, also continues to hold Nepali citizenship’ on Friday. The Election Commission on Saturday has asked for removal of the news report within 24 hours and sought explanation stating ‘There was character assassination of an individual who is candidate in the election and his family, and the news report has been published in a way that there is personal allegation’.
The letter issued by the Election Commission has yet to arrive in Setopati. We will decide whether to directly move the court to seek legal remedy or furnish explanation to the Election Commission once we receive the letter. We firmly believe that the Election Commission has instructed for removal of the news violating the limits and decorum of a constitutional commission on an issue it is not concerned with.
We have four major disagreements over the instruction by the Election Commission to remove the news and explanation it has sought.
First, the Election Commission has sought explanation on one hand while it has instructed to remove the news without waiting for that explanation on the other. This behavior of the Election Commission is ill-intentioned and unfortunate in itself.
The second is about its allegation that there was character assassination of an individual who is candidate in the election and his family, and the news report has been published in a way that there is personal allegation.
The news report published in Setopati mentions that Agni Kharel’s son Nishan Kharel serves in the US Army, and he still holds Nepali citizenship certificate and is included in the voter list. Both of those are facts. The Election Commission itself can check with its voter list. Our news report mentions that Agni Kharel himself has told Seopati that his son Nishan has been serving in the US Army for seven years.
We want to ask the Election Commission—how does this news report slander Agni Kharel who is candidate in the election, and his family? How is it an allegation?
The Election Commission instead has publicly slandered us by making such false allegations against Setopati. We challenge the Election Commission to prove this allegation, and request it to withdraw the same if it can’t.
We are clear that Nishan Kharel or any other Nepali reserves the rights to serve in the US or British or Indian army, or army or other security force of other countries, and it is a matter of individual choice for the person concerned.
Setopati stands for personal freedom of any individual. We don’t believe that moral questions can ever be asked of anyone on the basis of whether the person stays in Nepal or abroad, or serves in the Nepal Army or army of another country. People take decisions on the basis of their convenience and wish in different situations, and act accordingly. It is their individual and sovereign right if the decisions they take or their action do not harm others and do not violate the laws. We always respect those rights, and will always strive to protect those rights.
We also believe that the fact that a family member of a big leader or those who hold a major public position serves in a foreign army is a matter of interest for commoners, and hence a subject of news. We have, therefore, published the news of Nishan Kharel.
Those serving in the US Army should at least have permission for permanent residency in America. The person can easily acquire US citizenship after serving in the US Army. Nishan, who has been serving for seven years, should relinquish Nepali citizenship if he has acquired US citizenship. Not doing so would be against the laws of Nepal. We had asked Nishan’s father Agni whether Nishan has acquired US citizenship or not as he still holds Nepali citizenship. He could not say about Nishan’s US citizenship with certainty. We have also included Agni’s response in the news report. It is unfortunate that a constitutional body like the Election Commission has made allegations against a news story that we have reported complying with the decorum of journalism and completing due processes.
Third, this news is not related to the upcoming elections. It, therefore, does not attract the election code of conduct, nor can the Election Commission instruct for removal of the news citing the code of conduct. The Election Commission is not the authorized body to seek explanation about the news published by any media house or instruct for its removal.
Fourth, this is not the first time the Election Commission has sought clarification from Setopati in the name of election code of conduct. During the last local elections held in May, too, the Election Commission had sought clarification from us and instructed us to remove an election-related news. We had sent our clarification to the Election Commission refusing to remove the news.
That time the Election Commission had accused Setopati of violating the code of conduct by publishing election analyses based on conversations with voters of different local bodies. We were clear then and we are clear today as well that a voter has the right to privacy regarding who they want to vote for in an election. They need not reveal why they would or would not vote for somebody.
Also, voters also have the right to freedom of expression to publicly state why they would or would not vote for a candidate. Not only that, citizens also have the right to be politically organized, solicit votes for a political party and organize rallies.
Similarly, if any citizen tells a journalist without hesitation why she would or would not vote for somebody, what politician she likes or doesn’t like, whom she wants to help get elected or defeated, then a media house has the right to publish it. The Constitution itself has guaranteed that right and also defined its limits.
If it deems it necessary to ban the press from writing on something not prohibited by the Constitution and justifies that, then the legislature should formulate a law for it. The Election Commission cannot prepare a code of conduct that prohibits writing on issues not prohibited by the Constitution and the laws. The Election Commission’s code of conduct is not a law. We have already stated this in our earlier written clarification to the Election Commission.
Therefore, we urge the Election Commission to not discourage the press time and again, in the name of code of conduct, from reporting citizens’ views on political parties and leaders. We would also like to remind the Election Commission that such an act goes against the constitutional rights of citizens and the press.

On October 22 and 23, the Nepal Army (NA) organized a crucially important program to reflect on Nepal’s contribution to UN peace operations (PO). One of the several activities of the celebration was a seminar titled “Emerging capability requirements for UN Peace Operations and way forward” on October 23 at the NA headquarters where UN Under Secretary General for Peace Operations Jean-Pierre Lacroix virtually addressed the gathering. Chief Secretary of the Government of Nepal, NA Chief, and Military Advisor of the Secretary General of the UN and Nepal delegation head General Birame Diop were the other key persons to address the august gathering.
There were four presentations (3 from UN and 1 from NA) where I was also invited to make comments on presentations of two UN officials—“Developing and deploying capability needs for protection mandates” by Oliver Ulich (Deputy Representative UNHQ) and “Recommendations for TCCs like Nepal for generating and deploying suitable capabilities in UN Peace Operations” by Major General Hugh Van Roosen (retired).
The NA deserves special appreciation for organizing this very timely and highly relevant seminar and reflecting on our contribution to global peace, security and stability. It is equally important to critically look at what Nepal gained from this engagement and whether it is equitable compared to its contribution. Are we able to exhaust the potential for positioning Nepal as a champion of peacekeeping at the global level? What do we have to do to maximize our leverage and potential in this context and what should the UN think regarding the existing provisions of Troop and Police Contributing Countries (TPCC) in general and Nepal in particular?
Being a Nepali, I am very proud of the great contribution of our peacekeepers to maintaining international peace and security, one of the very foundational reasons of establishment of the UN in 1945, immediately after the Second World War by 51 countries.
That a Nepali peacekeepr accompanied the then UN Secretary General Kofi Annan to receive the Nobel Peace Prize for the UN in 2001 is evidence of the importance of Nepali peacekeepers in the UN and the contribution of Nepal to the UN peace mission.
Nepal has gained unique experiences by engaging in achieving stability and peace in highly unstable countries like Lebanon, Iraq, Mali, South Sudan, DRC, Yemen, Libya, the Central African Republic, Syria, Israel, Western Sahara, South Sudan and many others, thereby providing us with a powerful negotiation tool with the UN for expanded engagement in the future.
According to a recently (on the seminar) unveiled coffee-table book about Nepal’s contribution to the UN by the NA, more than 140,000 Nepali troops have engaged in 43 UN peacekeeping missions around the world so far. At present, about 5,623 Nepali men and women are serving in 12 peacekeeping missions in different parts of the world.
Further, Nepal is one of the only two TPCCs that have formed military units in all protection of civilian (POC) missions. This also shows the commitment of Nepal toward the global peace and stability mission of the UN.
So far, Peace Operation (PO) of the UN is largely guided by narrow, top-down headquarters, and the burden loaded on TPCCs (for example, capability needs for protection mandates to be arranged on their own), which needs to be changed to become more relevant. Nepal being the second largest contributor to UN peacekeeping, this is a direct concern. Capabilities for protection should not limit to training, units and equipment, and personnel which UN is advocating but also include commitment of international support. Only then can it be termed “Whole-of-Mission Approach” and it should always cover all four protection mandates (protection of civilians, child protection, conflict-related sexual violence, and human rights).
Even though the three tiers of POC concepts—dialogue and engagement; physical protection; and establishment of protective environment—are pragmatic, it is essential to add security governance and civil military relations in the third component ‘establishment of protective environment’, to enhance trust, ownership and gain local support.
One of the weak concepts used in the UN military component about responsibilities at the strategic level is ‘Do No Harm’, which is a contextual operational concept developed by Mary Anderson in 1999 in the conflict-affected development context. The UN PO must strategically expand it to “Do Good” as the POC mandate itself is for doing good. Though the Action for Peace+ of the SG emphasizes on “Systemwise Digital Transformation Strategy” as a capacity tool for protection mandate, incorporating early warning and forecasting digital system deserves further consideration.
Based on the experiences of more than six decades of engagement of the NA in UN peace missions, it is the right time to holistically review and address the concerns raised in this paper.
The Government of Nepal must expand its engagement with the UN for maintaining international peace and security, developing friendly relations among nations and promoting social progress, better living standards and human rights, a very foundational aim of creation of the UN. It will be a win-win result for both Nepal and the UN. The following are some of the possible ways forward.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) must focus on expanding its sphere of influence for which we have three major potential areas.

First, Nepal has a great scope of positioning itself as a champion of global climate change debate because glacier melts and related crisis in the Hindukush Himalayas are global concerns. Hence, Nepal must globally and proactively engage on the issues of climate change and related insecurities.
Second, we have Lumbini, the birthplace of Lord Buddha. Nepal’s meaningful and strategic proactive engagement with Buddhist countries will provide a large number of tourists to Lumbini to noticeably enhance our economy.  These two issues are not direct concerns of this paper and I am not going to discuss it further.
The third and the most important one is expanding Nepal’s engagement in UNPO by a) increasing total number of troops aiming to be the top TPCC, b) providing a higher number of female peacekeepers, c) ensuring more officers in senior positions (eg force commanders) and d) sending civilian experts (eg on rule of law, justice, human rights, women empowerment, ceasefire monitoring, post conflict reconstruction, etc).
Achieving these points will not be easy. The MoFA must send capable UN representatives with a higher profile, better negotiation skills, full commitment and a desire to work hard to achieve them. It may require continuous, proactive and meaningful dialogue and negotiation with the UN Secretary General, Security Council and its members, members of General Assembly, and UN representatives of other countries.

Similarly, the Ministry of Defense must work hard to create a favorable domestic environment for achieving the points listed above. The NA has already offered to send 10,000 troops and must be ready and it must be realized as soon as practically feasible. By expanding our peacekeepers, Nepal will gain more experiences and expand the zone of influence in international peace and stability.
The Ministry of Finance must ensure financial provisions for armored personnel carriers (APCs) and other logistics on par with the standard of other TPCCs.
The NA must make sure that the police and soldiers deployed in French and Spanish-speaking countries get language training before their deployment.
The UN in general and UNSG and Department of Peace Operations in particular should categorize member countries into groups regarding the PO:
Troops and Police Contributing Countries (TPCCs) (who are providing a large number of troops),
Capability Contributing Countries (CCC) who are not providing a significant number of troops. They have to be responsible for capabilities and logistics (like airlifting planes, armored vehicles, training, information and technology, and so on).
Regarding the contribution of peacekeepers from Nepal, there is no representation of senior officials proportional to the troops (there are only 6 Force Commanders so far). Therefore, the UN must seriously rethink it and make sure that recruitment of senior officers is commensurate with peacekeepers (also necessary for equity). Nepal has proved and gained international repute as a country committed to upholding the principles outlined in the UN Charter and the UN must, therefore, consider this concern.

In conclusion, the UN as well as the member states, especially resourceful countries who have the responsibility to maintain international peace and stability as per the UN Charter, have to rethink PO in the changing global context and ensure fairness to TPCCs, recognize the contribution of certain countries like Nepal in fulfilling objectives of the UN to keep international peace and stability. Hence, Nepal must provide space to increase peacekeepers, senior officials and civilian officials.

Every post has its decorum and dignity. The post of president as a head of state also has its own decorum and dignity. The dignity of that post is related to the duties defined by the Constitution.
“Compliance and protection of the Constitution shall be the main duties of the President,” Article 61(4) of the Constitution states.
The oath of office and secrecy administered to the president also mentions, “Remaining completely faithful to the Constitution of Nepal…under prevailing laws…will perform with sincerity.”
President Bidya Devi Bhandari has failed in the main duty prescribed by the Constitution, and destroyed the decorum and dignity of the post of president.
There is a constitutional provision allowing the president to send back any bill submitted for authentication by the sovereign parliament for reconsideration. But the president must authenticate the bill within 15 days if the House again sends it to the president. She did not have any alternative to that and authenticating the Citizenship Bill was her constitutional duty.
Some legal professionals have argued that the Citizenship Bill has also automatically become inactive once the term of the House of Representatives (HoR) expired, and the president need not authenticate it. But that is not true.
“If the session ends when a Bill is still under consideration, the next session may take over the procedure.
Provided that, if a Bill is presented to the House of Representatives and is under consideration, or it is sent to National Assembly after passing it, but if the House of Representatives is dissolved while the Bill is still under consideration in the National Assembly, or if its tenure comes to an end, such Bill shall be considered not effective,” states Article 111(10) of the Constitution.
The Citizenship Bill was not under consideration in any House, and was submitted to the president after being endorsed by both the HoR and the National Assembly. The Constitution and laws do not envision any bill passed by both the HoR and the National Assembly becoming inactive. The Constitution, similarly, also does not envision the president not authenticating the bill sent to the president for the second time.
The president’s step, therefore, has raised serious questions about the Constitution and system. Can an individual who does not obey the Constitution continue as president or not? If we assume she can, then it will create a wrong precedent for those becoming president in the coming days. What will happen if a future president also defies any decision taken by the government or the parliament?
We will then be forced to wait anxiously whether the president will authenticate any bill sent after being passed by the House, whether the president will endorse the decision taken by the Cabinet or not. We will, in other words, reach a situation where the president, and not the parliament or the Cabinet with majority in that parliament, will exercise the sovereign powers of the people. That will vitiate our system in an irrevocable manner. That will afflict every prime minister that comes after election in the future and the parliamentary system. Every party that can get into the government will be eventually afflicted.
There is, therefore, the need for rule-based and long-term treatment of the arbitrariness displayed by the president now. One may say “The president did not honor the Constitution, we will also not honor the president.” Or even inform that the bill automatically comes into effect by publishing it in the Nepal Gazette. But that would be a response in rage. Anger does not make the Constitution and system stronger.
It is necessary to once again move the court to protect the Constitution and system, and to make them stronger, to take the president who has deviated from her responsibilities and constitutional duties to the dock of the court.
The court has already corrected President Bhandari for not fulfilling her constitutional duties appropriately. She had refused to appoint Sher Bahadur Deuba as the prime minister in accordance to Article 76(5) of the Constitution after 149 HoR members wrote to her to that regard defying the rights of the HoR to elect PM. The Supreme Court after a long hearing issued a mandamus instructing her to appoint Deuba as PM and administer oath of office and secrecy within 24 hours.
The SC, definitely, would look at this issue if anyone moves the court demanding that the president be asked to fulfill her constitutional duties. The court has already interpreted clearly that judicial remedy can be sought for presidential acts saying that the provision prohibiting filing of court cases against the president for works done in capacity of the president is limited only up to prohibiting making the president personally liable. But there remains no such limits about examination of the legal validity of the questions raised about use and implementation of the constitutional rights and provisions by the president.
That court verdict adds that no state official remains above the law or beyond the purview of law in a constitutional system incorporating democratic norms and values, and in rule of law. It reminds that keeping all presidential decisions beyond the purview of legal examination would ultimately lead to arbitrariness and autocracy.  
This precedent clearly shows that the court can look at the dereliction of the constitutional duty by the president in not authenticating the Citizenship Bill.
It is necessary to take this issue to the court and conclude it there to show constitutional limits to the president who displayed arbitrariness by not authenticating the bill submitted to her after being passed by the parliament, and also to remind her successors about those limits.

The Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) has been sending police and staffers with excavators in tow in the Hattisar area, where Tukucha has been put through an underground tunnel, for the past few days. They have been digging the ground in private houses of individuals and companies, demolishing walls, and threatening and instructing the owners to remove the structures. Owners of the houses and the land have been saying they have not encroached the land, rather procured it by completing legal procedures, built houses in accordance to the designs passed by the KMC and acquired documents of completing construction. With documents and evidence in hand, they have been pleading with the KMC to have a look at those documents. But the police and KMC staffers deployed on the field with excavators have not listened to their pleadings. They have been evading the owners saying, “Don’t tell us, ask engineers, and those above us.” And threatening that the houses will be demolished if found above the tunnel through which Tukucha is flowing.
A team of police and staffers reached the residence of 82-year-old Sharada Manandhar at Hattisar with excavators on Monday, shut the compound gate that was open, and then brought the gate down with the excavator. She had rented a small truss-structure inside the compound to a coffee house for the past four years. That was an additional source of income on top of her government pension. The KMC ordered her to demolish the structure stating that it is above Tukucha and warned that they will run the excavator if it is not demolished. The tenant has vacated the coffee house after KMC’s threats.
The police and KMC staffers are not to blame for all this, and its main leadership—Mayor Balen Shah—is the one responsible. He doesn’t want to check the facts of Hattisar, nor is he ready to listen to the locals. Yogesh Mishra, a local, met Shah at his office armed with documents and evidence, and tried to brief him about the facts but Shah was uninterested in his efforts, Mishra claims.
The KMC has started to display the brutality of excavators instead of looking at the facts and evidence presented by the locals, and presenting its own evidence to show that the locals have encroached the land.
What is this attitude showed by the KMC leadership, its police and staffers? It is necessary to call and define this mentality for what it is. This is blatant thuggery. The state’s thuggery over the law-abiding citizens is an unpardonable crime in democracy. And this crime needs to stop immediately.
The facts that we have unearthed, our conversation with locals of Hattisar, and the documents and evidence they have clearly show that they have not encroached the land. This is ancestral property of some; others had legally procured the land only some time back and built houses there. The land there has been sold and procured at government offices for years. Those who have built houses and other structures have done so after passing the design through the KMC and taking permission from other bodies concerned.
The land in Hattisar was never under government ownership. The land was owned by local farmers when the then Rana prime minister Bir Shumsher decided to put the Tukucha flowing out from the southern wall of the Narayanhiti Palace inside a tunnel 130 years ago. Historical documents have proved that the Ranas had acquired the land at Rs 200 per ropani. They constructed the underground tunnel for Tukucha and built a spacious ground by filling the tunnel but they never brought that land under the state’s ownership. That land was eventually distributed among Bir Shumsher’s children. Some of the plots there are still owned by Bir Shumsher’s descendants. Others have been transferred to the current owners after legal transactions.
The most important thing is, the land was surveyed in 1975. The map prepared then does not mention Tukucha. Not many may have remembered the Tukucha that was sent underground more than 80 years earlier. The state may also not have deemed it necessary to keep Tukucha in the map.
To say that the owners should have known about the Tukucha that was never mentioned in government map, and accuse them of encroaching the land over Tukucha and building houses is sheer insanity. The KMC has been doing precisely that now. To try to remove the locals from there through threats and excavator terror without completing any legal process and provision of compensation is an unthinkable act by the state. The Constitution has granted inviolable rights to property for the citizens. The excavators sent by Balen Shah cannot violate that, nor can the state take an ax to the private property of citizens without paying appropriate compensation.
The land and houses are not just physical properties for the people. They are connected with the person’s and her family’s love, sweat and many memories, and self-respect. The place is beloved for every individual with special importance and prestige. Where does the KMC get the rights to deploy excavators on such places without their permission when they have not committed any offense? Which morality granted that? Those hurting the self-respect of citizens by deploying excavators are liable for punishment in rule of law. Our law also deems attack on others’ properties a punishable offense.
There seems to be a frightening tendency now. A few individuals seem to be happy when the state has attacked others' properties. It is the nature of the crowd to take sadistic pleasure at the sufferings of others. That is understandable. But another dangerous tendency can also be seen in the Nepali society now—not speaking and writing against wrong deeds of Balen Shah due to his popularity. The victims of Hattisar have met Kathmandu lawmakers and leaders of parties and briefed their grievances. But the leaders have expressed helplessness saying, “We cannot speak against Balen Shah at such times.”
Expressing their helplessness, the victims say, “Politicians don’t listen to us, the media doesn’t write about us. What justice would the court provide during such a time?”
Some state bodies appear hesitant to fulfill their responsibilities. For example, it has come to light that the Tukucha tunnel was built 130 years ago by Bir Shumsher. Many say it was an amazing example of engineering for that period. The fact that the great earthquakes of 1934 and 2015 could not inflict any damage to the underground tunnel also clearly shows how strong the structure was built. Therefore, it is our heritage of historical and archeological importance that shows the engineering technology of the Rana period. According to law, no structure older than 100 years can be altered or demolished. It can only be altered under the supervision of the Department of Archaeology. The law has given that authority to the Department of Archeology. But the department seems reluctant to fulfill its responsibilities. It has remained silent even when the KMC’s excavators have been digging up such an old heritage every day. It has not even bothered to go and inspect the sites of excavation.
If society starts bowing down to populism like this, then democracy will start losing its essence. Therefore, it is necessary to speak and write about this injustice meted out by the KMC to the citizens so that those who are facing injustice do not lose their hope for justice. A democratic society is also a society that puts faith in justice in each other. Those who face the wrath of the state are left alone only in an autocratic society, where everyone fears the state.
Thankfully, there is also a good side to a populist wave—populism is usually short-lived. And people in a democratic society will challenge it sooner or later.
What now?
First of all, the thuggery needs to be stopped. The KMC needs to bring the excavator terror to an end and stop threatening the citizens.
And the KMC should discuss the issue with a cool mind in its executive meeting, and take decision in light of the facts that have come to the fore. It should consider whether the Tukucha tunnel has to be demolished or not? The settlement of Hattisar has to be displaced or not? The cost for doing so, the return on the expenses incurred, and whether that can be justified considering other glaring priorities of the KMC?
There will be debate in the media and the civil society on what to do about Tukucha, and whether to revive it or not. People will put their own positions on different aspects of the issue. That is inseparable and essential in a democratic society. That will bring many aspects of the disputed issue to the fore, and help the decision-makers take decision. But the sovereign rights to take a call rest on them in capacity of the elected people’s representatives. The Constitution has provisions specifying what the local government, the provincial government and the federal government can do. Everyone should fulfill one’s responsibility accordingly.
If the settlement has to be evacuated, the KMC must hold friendly dialogue with the locals about compensation. They should not be treated like enemies. Both the sides should agree and move forward accordingly. The Government of Nepal should take decision in accordance to the Land Acquisition Act if there is no such agreement, and pay compensation accordingly. And move the works forward.
No government has the authority to ignore the laws, processes and regulations, and unleash excavators on an individual’s property taking a mob, threaten the citizens and oppress them. That is not accepted in a civilized and democratic society.

Reporting of incidents of sexual assaults in Nepal has increased significantly in the last 10 years. More survivors are opening up as a result of social media's growth and the global #MeToo movement. Such violations have a wider impact than is generally thought. Cases of sexual abuse also have an underlying effect on mental health, in addition to the legal and socioeconomic repercussions. To comprehend how such events worsen survivors' mental health, sufficient research and studies have not been conducted.
A 24-year-old girl from Baglung in western Nepal was frequently raped by her father-in-law for a few years. Her husband was abroad for employment during that period. When this incident came out, her father-in-law accused her of infidelity and questioned her ""character"". Though authorities are investigating this matter, her mental health has deteriorated to the point that she has lost most of her senses.
Delay in filing cases for these crimes has deteriorated many survivors' mental health, according to journalist Nisha Oli. The majority of survivors take their time opening up. Their mental health is further hampered by this delay.
The road to rehabilitation is not easy, she continues. Most of the time, survivors are unaware of the necessity. Additionally, there are no agencies or groups that serve as mediators to ease the changeover. Although we are not professionals, I have observed various psychiatric issues among survivors. We can only help them along. The predicament is alarming.
While every instance of sexual abuse is unique, the effects it has on women and girls are often the same.
A 25-year-old traumatized survivor is now residing at a hostel in Kathmandu. The abuser has fled, and she is a long way from receiving justice. Her life has been turned upside down. Her life has changed since her mother passed away. Her father soon moved on after getting remarried. She is living alone now that her grandmother has passed away. For her, this was not the end.
She was assaulted at the home of a relative. Nobody believed her. Rather, she was blamed by many. At that point, everything for her was altered. She has been experiencing mental, physical, social, and psychological difficulties for the past nine years. She started to get suicidal tendencies. She spoke about the events in a very frank manner, unlike the majority of survivors.
Her attempts to get assistance were unsuccessful. However, neither the police nor the public gave her any credit. She contacted many groups, but none of them were able to assist. Organizations like the National Women’s Commission and Maiti Nepal responded in a lukewarm and disappointing manner. They also made fun of her for having mental health issues. They heightened the suffering. Numerous survivors have similar life experiences. Commission employees treat survivors like animals. They torture sufferers instead of offering consolation and compassion. There are numerous instances of survivors who have made it to Anuradha Koirala, the founder of Maiti Nepal, and then returned home sobbing. One of the survivors declared, ""All that glitters is not gold.”
Many of the responsible groups have utterly failed in this regard. These groups frequently throw temper tantrums, including berating, requesting that survivors contact the police or bring attorneys, and refusing to offer assistance. The persistent lack of empathy displayed by these institutions hurts the survivors. According to many analysts, social organizations and government entities are found wanting on this issue. Simply put, there is a lack of knowledge, urgency, and priority.
Journalist Nisha Oli claims that survivors have access to safe shelters. These safe houses offer lodging, help with processing abortions, and limited therapy. However, there are little long-term benefits from short-term counseling. According to Nisha, counseling should not only concentrate on giving support but also assist in the development of life skills. These skills bring financial independence and respect.
A Nepali girl claimed a few months ago on her Instagram and Tiktok pages that she had experienced several rapes and other forms of torture. She went on to say that the trauma caused by these sexual assaults had ruined her life and left her with despair, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
She revealed the abuser's identity and the circumstances she had to deal with after numerous instances of sexual assault in a video that was posted on TikTok and Instagram. There was widespread outrage over this across the nation. Massive rallies and demonstrations demanding justice for her were held in its wake. Her candor inspired many women and girls to talk about their traumatic experiences. The parliament heard debates over the statute of limitations for such crimes.The struggle against sexual assault has gained the much-needed spark.
The case, according to many experts, is just the beginning. The number of sexual assault cases that have been reported has sharply increased in recent years; 2144 and 2230 rape cases were reported in the fiscal years 2018–2019 and 2019–2020, respectively. There were 981 instances in the fiscal year 2014–2015, marking a 10-year high for the number. According to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey, 7% of women and girls (15–49) nationwide have reported experiencing sexual assault at some point in their lives. Even if the rates are rising, it is believed that they are actually even higher. Many women have been forced to keep such crimes to themselves due to the sensitive nature of crime.
Due to survivors' lack of knowledge about their legal rights and the lack of assistance they receive from friends and family, most of such incidents of sexual assault go unreported or remain secret. Instead of demanding retribution from the offender, many times survivors are questioned about their character instead. As a result, the judicial procedure rarely takes place and most of the time, offenders get away scot free.
The mental health support group Umanga Nepal carried out a poll on a small sample of women. Eighteen adolescent girls were surveyed, and the results showed that 15 of them experienced various forms of sexual abuse. Rape, attempted rape, sexual harassment, and sexual misbehavior were all covered. The majority of them experienced maltreatment as children, and they are still traumatized by it. In most cases, family members, friends, coworkers, boyfriends, and strangers were the culprits. Nine of the 18 females experienced abuse in their own homes when aged 10-14 years from family members and neighbors.
The majority of them struggle with anxiety, sleep problems, trauma, and challenges of trust. Their relationships and profession have both been harmed by this. Their confidence and aspirations have been destroyed by the trauma of such an event. Many of the victims have not yet sought legal representation or confronted their abusers. Social hierarchies and taboos are to blame to this. Fears of judgment, marginalization, and victimization are just a few among them. The majority of poll respondents experience guilt, shame, and panic. They are all guilty of self-blame. Survivors of sexual abuse are frequently at risk for mental health problems because of the trauma brought on by such occurrences and the self-deprecating emotions they elicit.
Sexual-abuse survivors are more prone to experiencing traumatic disorders and trust issues, according to psychotherapist Sita Lama from Mann Ka Kura, who has experience of working with trafficked girls and women. The majority of them are compelled to live with the trauma because they are reluctant to discuss freely about their mental health due to their family history, fear of criticism, and fear of being judged.
She concurs that it takes time for those who have experienced molestation during their formative years or at any other time to open up and find courage. Even if they do open up, they are uncomfortable conversing. In a few instances, people arrive looking for assistance for their ""friends."" But the majority of the time, it's their own tale.
“Even if they visit us, they are not at ease. Counselors must speak to clients in a way that encourages them to open up and begin believing in us. Some of them crumble and despise their own bodies,” she continues.
The slogan, according to Lama, is ""It's not our fault."" Acknowledging pain is the first step on the road to recovery. Dance therapy, behavior therapy, and art therapy can all aid with trauma reduction. However, recovery takes time. It won't happen overnight. Every instruction must be followed. It takes some time to find the wound and heal it.
When we respect and cherish our bodies, we can communicate with them mentally and emotionally. We are not to blame for anything that has happened to us in the past. In light of this, Lama considers loving and caring for the body to be one of the most crucial tasks.
Trauma is merely the beginning of the agony trail. Substance misuse is one of the main effects of such trauma. Most survivors take this route to get away from their experience. One of the survey's survivors related a similar experience. Drunken urges to temporarily flee are very likely. Many survivors still take drugs despite being aware of their negative effects. Unprescribed medications are more hazardous than helpful, as has been universally accepted and empirically demonstrated.
Sexual assault cases are not limited by gender or color. It has received a lot of discussion and condemnation. Studies and research of various kinds are being conducted. According to a study by Boston-based Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health professor Karestan Koenen, sexual assault and harassment ""often take a significant long-term toll on a victim's mental and physical health, increasing the risk for not only depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but also high blood pressure and sleep loss.""
""Not everyone who has been assaulted or harassed will endure persistent and lifelong repercussions. Being surrounded by a lot of supportive social networks can be beneficial for some people,"" she claimed. But a lot of folks aren't, Koenen continued. “Many women avoid discussing their experiences with others, often for years, out of concern that they won't be believed or that they would be referred to as ""nuts"" or ""sluts."" They, therefore, keep a secret from others, which wears them down over time and prevents them from receiving the assistance they require. Additionally, these encounters are extremely taxing on a bodily and psychological level.""
Sexual assault instances come in a variety of forms, according to Ram Pukar Shah, a clinical psychologist at Kanti Bal Hospital and CEO of the Subha Mangal Group. Some individuals discover the information after the fact.
""Our conversations are private. We start by getting a better grasp of the clients' behavior, interests, and character attributes. We don't rush because it's a delicate subject and it takes victims a long time to open up. We start by diagnosing the problems, whether they are anxiety, PTSD, or depression.
“Sometimes it's necessary to refer a patient to a psychiatrist and prescribe medicine as well, allowing therapy and medication to work in concert. We try several approaches based on the situation and the severity of the condition. There is therapy for trauma. We have to convince them that they are secure.
“Some survivors recover on their own with counseling, while others require behavioral therapy. Multiple abuse victims require extra time to recover. However, developing trust with your therapist or counselor is a crucial step.
“However, psychological counseling and therapy are still in their infancy in a nation like Nepal. The industry has come under fire for lacking professionalism and accessibility. Whoever is sincere and nonjudgmental is a true professional,” Shah continues.

Dipendra Kunwar has been promoted to Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) of the Armed Police Force (APF) in a way that he is ranked top from his batch.
He has not topped his batch due to his capabilities. He is not only incapable compared to others from his batch but was not even eligible to be recommended for promotion now. But he has been recommended as the highest ranked among his batch mates after pulling strings due to his relation with the political leadership at Baluwatar.
Kunwar is the husband of Bhanu Deuba’s sister. Bhanu Deuba is the nephew and personal secretary of Prime Minister (PM) Sher Bahadur Deuba. Kunwar, who has been recommended for promotion to SSP, in this way is the son-in-law of PM Deuba.
He has been pushed forward in a fraudulent manner in a way that he becomes APF chief in the future because he is a relative of the Deuba family.
The promotion committee under the Home Ministry chaired by the Home Secretary decided to recommend 14 Superintendents of Police (SP) to SSP on Friday. Kunwar has been ranked second overall behind Praveen Kandel, who joined the APF from the Nepal Police and is set to retire soon, and top among his batch mates.
The APF regulation, which required APF personnel to serve for at least four years in a position to become eligible for promotion in the APF, was amended for Kunwar’s promotion. Kunwar would complete four years as Superintendent of Police (SP) only in April 2023. So, the government amended the regulation on July 6 and changed the eligibility to three years.
Kunwar had joined the APF as inspector on March 21, 2003. He was ranked toward the bottom of the 74 inspectors of his batch. But he was ranked 10th from among his batch mates when he was promoted to SP from Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), and has now been made top-ranked among his batch mates.
Bishnu Prasad Bhatta, who was the top-ranked inspector among the 74 from Kunwar’s batch, has now been ranked behind Kunwar while being promoted to SSP.
The main objective for promoting him now as the top-ranked among his batch mates is to make him Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of Police first and then Inspector General of Police (IGP).
There are currently three vacancies for DIG in the APF. There is no experience eligibility for DIG as in junior positions and Kunwar will directly become a candidate for DIG as Kandel, who is top-ranked among the newly promoted SSPs, would retire before becoming DIG due to age limit. Kunwar, who is ranked behind Kandel, would be an obvious claimant to IGP.
One must pass staff college to become DIG of the APF. Kunwar has twice failed entrance examinations for staff college. But the APF leadership took a special decision to send him to the staff college of Nepal Army (NA) at Shivapuri for the course even though only the best few APF officers are sent to the Nepal Army staff college. It is, in this way, clearly apparent that he completed staff college due to political backing.
SP Kunwar’s promotion is directly connected to PM Deuba. The PM or his secretariat is at the center of how he has been illegitimately recommended for promotion, that too in a way that he is ranked top among his batch mates.
It is now PM Deuba’s responsibility to either prove that the facts that have been uncovered about Kunwar now are false or revoke his unlawful recommendation. Deuba is guardian of all those serving the nation through NA, Nepal Police, APF and civil service in his capacity as the executive head of the country. The government led by him cannot mete out injustice to anyone.
Deuba’s responsibility as a PM elected by the people is toward the country and not his family. Democracy is a system of government of the people but all the citizens cannot go to the Singha Durbar and govern as that is not practically possible. The citizens, therefore, should govern through their representatives. The government or the leadership of government, in this manner, is the representative of citizens governing in their stead.
It is the responsibility of those in the leadership to use that for the larger good of the citizens. It is arbitrary to shirk one’s responsibility and take any decision for the benefit of oneself or those close to oneself. Arbitrariness of the leadership is unacceptable and unpardonable in democracy.
There is also another side to this.
It is a legitimate expectation of every police officer to be top-ranked if she has performed well, has displayed integrity in behavior, excelled in work, and is more qualified than other contenders.
“The issue of promotion to IGP is not just an issue of the government’s pleasure but is also an issue of the rights and legitimate expectation of the candidates concerned,” reads a Supreme Court verdict curtailing the arbitrariness of the government in IGP appointment.
PM Deuba cannot trample on the legitimate expectations of any qualified police officer to promote his relative even now. Display of such arbitrariness by those in the government can harm the police organization in the long run.  
If there is no environment where a new officer who has recently joined the police force can expect to become the IGP in the future because she believes she is the best police officer based on her conduct and capabilities, then why would anyone strive to become a good police officer? She will then try to curry favor with politicians and arrange money to offer to higher-ups. What will happen to the security of the country and the citizens then? Discrimination against public servants by every political party and leadership when in power will kill their dreams. That will, in turn, give rise to despair and increase malpractices in police and administration.
It does not suit somebody like PM Deuba, who has even endured life in prison during such a long political career, to promote his relative causing injustice to others. More than that, this is blatantly immoral.
We urge PM Deuba to immediately intervene and revoke the unlawful recommendation for promotion of his relative, protect the rights of other police officers, give them justice and save himself from yet another stain on his name.

The issue of grave controversy that Finance Minister Janardan Sharma has been mired is no longer limited to the Finance Ministry. The main responsibility for accountability definitely is Minister Sharma’s. But the buck stops with Prime Minister (PM) Sher Bahadur Deuba as chairman of the Cabinet and Chairman of Sharma’s party Pushpa Kamal Dahal now that Sharma has run away from accountability.
It is now PM Deuba’s responsibility to either prove that Finance Minister Sharma has not committed any offense or to immediately fire him and conduct an investigation. It is CPN (Maoist Center) Chairman Dahal’s responsibility to take initiative for that or at least support it as Sharma is minister from his party.
We don’t know whether the grave allegations against Sharma that unauthorized persons entered the Finance Ministry premises in the midnight and corrected the tax rates in the budget to serve vested interests are true or not.
But after the closed-circuit television (CCTV) footage episode we firmly believe that the issue should not be resolved without judicial or parliamentary investigation. Sharma can return to the ministry if he is proved innocent but he should be liable for legal and political punishment if his involvement in this grave crime is established.
The issue for investigation is simple and clear. Had any unauthorized person entered the Finance Ministry in the midnight a day before the budget was presented in the federal parliament or not?
Minister Sharma has publicly claimed that no unauthorized persons entered the Finance Ministry at the time of finalizing the budget. We can give him benefit of doubt, if it can be given at all, only until the investigation on CCTV footage is completed. The investigation will find him innocent or guilty.  
The irresponsible response that the Finance Ministry has given stating that the CCTV footage can be retained only for 13 days in the right to information (RTI) request filed by a citizen seeking footage of the ministry at the alleged time of crime has made this issue graver.
There are two sides of the CCTV footage episode. The first is the right of citizens for access to and surveillance of the works done by the state. The second is the responsibility of the Finance Ministry to keep the CCTV footage safe for at least three months.  
Nepal has formulated law related to RTI. The spirit of that law is clear—the citizens have the right for surveillance of any work done by the state, any state organ or any official in that organ in a democratic country. They can seek information related to that in writing.
The right of such surveillance of the politicians elected by the people and who are remunerated by the taxes paid by them is fundamental in a democratic system. It is the duty of every politician to be sensitive toward the right granted to the citizens by the law and comply with it. They cannot shirk from their responsibility.
The RTI has been granted considering that politicians or any authorized person can take decision in a dark room against public interest for self-interest of them or others to ensure that they can make such decisions public and resist against those decisions.
The citizens have been fulfilling their responsibilities toward democracy by electing politicians through their votes even in the most adverse conditions on the one hand. They have also been bearing the financial burden of keeping the state functioning by paying taxes despite the financial difficulties they face on the other.  
It is, therefore, necessary to imbibe that the rights of citizens for surveillance of the state and politicians is inviolable.  
How important the issue of a citizen seeking CCTV footage of the Finance Ministry automatically becomes clear once one accepts this basic tenet. It is legal and moral responsibility of the Finance Ministry leadership to provide the footage sought completing legal procedures.  The ministry has shirked from this responsibility by giving a written response that the ministry’s CCTV footage can be retained only for 13 days.  
The Home Ministry’s guidelines about installation and operation of CCTV requires footage of CCTV cameras be kept safe for at least three months and adds that the district administration office concerned can investigate about the CCTV footage. The footage of May 28, therefore, should be kept safe at least until August 28.
The gravity of allegations against Minister Sharma has increased further after the ministry’s response that it does not have the footage of the final night before the budget was presented in the House. He should not be exonerated of this episode without investigation which should start by immediately removing him as minister.
Technological experts can retrieve the footage even if it has been lost. The wrong intentions would be automatically proved if the footage has been deleted in an irretrievable manner.
PM Deuba and Maoist Center Chairman Dahal do not have the luxury of ignoring this episode. Their support for Sharma, if not implication, will be clearly established if they do so.

During the monsoon season, almost every day, we wake up to some hazardous events such as landslides and floods and their devastating impact on people and society. Over the last decade Nepal experienced a number of major floods, landslides, windstorms, lightnings, public health-related and other monsoon hazards that caused loss of lives and livelihoods. This explains the diversity of hazards that Nepal faces and underscores the importance of more predictable and accountable disaster management.
2022 monsoon outlook and preparedness
The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority (NDRRMA) estimates around two million people can be potentially affected by the monsoon hazards in 2022. Based on this caseload all three levels of government—federal, provincial, and local—together with humanitarian partners including the private sector have been engaged in preparedness and readiness activities to effectively respond to the potential monsoon disasters.
However, there are questions about effective implementation of such plans and policies. For example, when there is a disaster, provisions on such plans are overlooked. All the disaster management committees at local, district, provincial and federal levels convene and take some generic decisions. Often there is redundancy in the decisions and no follow-up. Coordination with other relief providers such as volunteer groups, private sector and civil society is ad-hoc. In the name of one-door policy, relief activities are held up. Often relief workers find it difficult to navigate the complexities and reach to the population in need of support.
“Funds and materials get allocated. There is never a serious shortfall, but the governance mechanism which is needed most during the time of crisis becomes more confusing. Whenever there is a disaster situation everybody in the bureaucracy and the political system, from ward member to the prime minister, gets engaged,” says Krishna Lamichhane, a Red Cross worker in Nawalparasi of Lumbini province. “They try to politically capitalize on the humanitarian situation and make a trip to the affected site. But real relief work takes a hit.” Lamichhane believes empowering front-line Red Cross network would improve delivery.
Front-line governance
An accountable and predictable approach is required to timely protect lives and livelihoods from hazards and ensure effective disaster response. The Constitution of Nepal has entrusted the local bodies with an exclusive jurisdiction and responsibilities in disaster management. The local officials including elected ward officials, police, health workers and Red Cross are the first responders and manage the relief efforts in the critical early hours of response.
Given their detailed knowledge of the community, the local bodies are best able to identify hazards, assess vulnerabilities and design appropriate policies to reduce and manage risks. Local officials are well positioned to spearhead disaster preparedness planning. Moreover, many practical local measures can be implemented at the local level to ensure disasters are managed locally as much as possible and nationalized only when it is necessary.
Although local bodies bear primary functional responsibility for disaster management, local capacity particularly in disaster response is weak. The local bodies lack own search and rescue workers and technical expertise. The district authorities, which are federal government entities, maintain the capability in search and rescue, and support the local bodies. Post-disaster analyses essentially reveal that local disaster management capacities are weak and underfunded.
In addition to the technical capabilities, local decision-making process has to be effective and efficient. “The governance mechanism has to be facilitating and coordinating in responding to disasters or other problems in the society,” says Deputy Mayor of Rajapur Municipality in Bardiya Mankala Kumari Chaudhary. She emphasizes that necessary guidelines, protocols and standards have to be developed and updated by the government. To have predictability in governance, there must be accountability of the elected officials and the institutions and partnership with wide range of actors in the society.
Transforming traditional governance to anticipatory approaches
Given the unpredictability in hazards, the country needs to move away from the traditional form of reactive approach to more anticipatory approaches. The anticipatory approaches are the ability to harness the collective intelligence and wisdom of collaborating with organizations and citizens. According to Leon Fuerth (2009), anticipatory governance is “a system of institutions, rules and norms that provide a way to use foresight for the purpose of reducing risk and to increase capacity to respond to events at early rather than later states of their development.”
Better disaster preparedness and anticipatory governance could be achieved by emphasizing readiness for all types of hazards and involving multiple dimensions including mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery.
Nepal has started practicing anticipatory governance approach in disaster management one way or the other. For instance, the government, security forces and other partners annually organize simulation and drill exercises before the onset of monsoon season. These exercises are important in diagnosing shortfall in disaster response plan and mechanisms and help in fostering strong working relationships among the responders.
The Department of Hydrology and Meteorology has been providing three-day and the long-range forecasts. Based on these weather forecasts, authorities disseminate early warning messages to the communities. The local governments and relief organizations are able to implement some preventive and mitigative measures before there is a flood.
Also, there is an ongoing discourse on strict implementation of land use policy to reduce the impacts of hazards. The land use regulations that prohibit construction on risky land such as flood plains contribute to averting the disaster. “Traditionally, the community and its leaders have set norms and rules on the land use and zoning of land. The land was classified based on its nature and topography. But these days with boom in real estate every piece of land, even dangerously sloping land, is being bulldozed,” says Khagendra Pant, local high school teacher in Bhajani, Kailali.
The NDRRMA is leading scenario-based preparedness which involves analyzing underlying risk and vulnerabilities to different hazards and developing caseloads. The authority asks different ministries, departments and partners to prepare a plan based on those scenarios and caseloads. It also involves measuring a community’s capability to respond effectively—such as planning for the evacuation sites for people living with disability. The NDRRMA has embraced the principles of risk management in its disaster preparedness and response approach. Risk-based emergency planning involves assessment of the risk a community is likely to face, and estimation of probable impacts associated with these risks over a specific period. The process of identifying, analyzing and prioritizing risk is increasingly regarded as the optimal means to allocate scarce emergency management resources.
Call to action
The underlying risk posed by the climate change and unpredictability in the hazard patterns warrant anticipatory governance to take preventative and mitigating approaches in saving lives and livelihood. It’s high time we made disaster response and recovery work more predictable, accountable, and responsive. With these unprecedented challenges, the policy development requires speed. Some policies must be developed and updated within a short period of time. The scope of the policy work and problem of the communities need to be adequately diagnosed. Additionally, resources from each level of government should be brought to the table and inter-governmental collaboration should be forged. This is how a system that is able to respond to the unexpected crises arising from climate change can be built.
To make disaster response anticipatory, a multi-hazard early warning system has to be put in place. A system that is able to cope with any foreseen and unforeseen crisis requires updating and activating the communication networks across provinces, districts, local bodies and practitioners.

The politics is heated in the past few days due to the State Partnership Program (SPP) of America. Facts and lies alike regarding the SPP have come to the fore.
Foreign Minister Narayan Khadka’s comments about the SPP in the House, the US Embassy’s briefing to journalists, the statement issued by the Nepal Army (NA) and speeches by politicians in accordance with their interests have created confusions instead of clarifying about SPP.
The US Embassy invited journalists and stated that no draft of SPP agreement has been submitted to the Government of Nepal. It also claimed that Nepal had applied to participate in SPP in 2015 and 2017, and the application was approved in 2019.
The then Nepal Army (NA) Chief Rajendra Chhetri had applied for partnership on both the occasions and the NA had copied both the applications to the Defense Ministry and the Foreign Ministry of Nepal, according to the US Embassy.
The NA issued a statement Wednesday evening claiming that no agreement or understanding has been signed about the SPP. ""The Nepal Army has not signed any agreement or understanding about the SPP with the US Army or government, and there is no process toward signing such agreement,"" the NA statement says. ""The Nepal Army is always clear about the objective fact about not doing military partnership in the future with anyone in a way that can adversely affect the non-aligned foreign policy adopted by Nepal and Nepal's special geopolitical location and strategic sensitivities.""
The NA statement has mentioned that no agreement or understanding has been signed about the SPP but it has not spoken about the claims of the US Embassy that it had first applied for participation in 2015 and then again in 2017.
No agreement needs to be signed to participate in the SPP going by what the US Embassy says. Interested countries apply for participation and America accepts the application.
The Government of Nepal should now inform the House about all the facts related to SPP issuing a white paper. The issue will continue to create suspicions otherwise. It will become an issue for political one-upmanship and allegations and counter-allegations.
The NA must have copies of the applications submitted by the then NA Chief Chhetri in 2015 and 2017. The US Embassy’s claims that both the applications were also copied to the Defense Ministry and the Foreign Ministry of Nepal hint that the two ministries also have copies of the applications. The letter that Chhetri had sent in 2015 when KP Sharma Oli was prime minister (PM) has been made public Thursday.
But the letter said to have been sent in 2017 has yet to be made public and what exactly was written in that letter has yet to be known. America has said that it allowed Nepal to join the SPP in 2019 on the basis of these two applications.
The Government of Nepal should seek answers from America if the intention of those two letters was not to become part of the SPP and ask for removal of Nepal’s name from its website.
The government and the NA cannot be irresponsible and just say that they have not signed any agreement when America has listed Nepal as a member country of the SPP.
What may actually have happened is the NA asked for help from the US Army in disaster management after the Gorkha Earthquake in 2015. It may have applied for the SPP after the US Army likely responded that such assistance can be provided after receiving application for the SPP. The NA may again have applied in 2017 for similar assistance.
We don’t believe that the NA or the government led by any politician will knowingly decide to enter a long-term military partnership with America. Nobody seems to be in a state to definitively say about all the aspects related to the SPP today. Politicians, be those inside the government or in the opposition, seem more confused. They, however, are resorting to allegations and counter-allegations against each other even in this confusion. They are spending the time they should invest on understanding the issue and unearth the facts in making allegations.
CPN-UML—which has been the loudest in raising questions about the SPP both inside the House and outside to try to show that it is the only nationalist party, and create doubts about patriotism of others—is in an awkward position after it has been revealed that the first application for participation in the SPP was sent when the party led the government.
CPN (Maoist Center) Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal seems to be in haste to allege that Oli made the deal as he led the government when America accepted Nepal’s application in 2019.
This nature of our politicians to resort to inflammatory allegations and counter-allegations on sensitive national issues instead of displaying appropriate gravity and sensitivity is not new. The allegations that politicians knowingly or unknowingly have levelled against each other since 1951 about nationalism and foreign policy have made Nepal weak in the eyes of foreigners the most. Leaders and parties are unfortunately repeating the same irresponsibility and rhetoric even on the issue of SPP.
We believe the politicians who try to depict only themselves as nationalists and always attack on patriotism and integrity of others, and publicly slander others calling them brokers are fake nationalists.
The need of the hour is to find out truth and facts about the SPP, make them public and conclude the issue forging national unity. The SPP is not merely a program for the US Army to assist other countries in issues including disaster management as claimed by the US Embassy and Foreign Minister Khadka in the House. Those things are also part of the SPP but the SPP is more than that.
An article about the main objectives of the SPP by a former chief of the American National Guard that cooperates with armies of different countries clarifies how broad the SPP’s scope is and what its main objectives are.
This definitely does not mean that the NA should not establish any relations with the US Army. The NA has relations with the armies of India, China, US and other countries for years. The NA participates in joint exercises with the Indian and Chinese armies every year. It also holds joint drills with the US Army.
The US Army has been providing training to the NA on disaster management, search and rescue, counter-terrorism and other areas. NA officials go to American war colleges and other organizations for studies and training on a regular basis. This practice had been continuing even before Nepal applied for the SPP.
What necessitated Nepal’s application for the SPP in recent years? How can we be assured that this application incorporates only these areas of cooperation between the NA and the US Army? Who will give the assurance?
Nepal cannot, and must not, enter the wide spectrum of partnership between the two armies under the SPP. On the one hand, we have our geopolitical sensitivity, and we have our constitutional commitment and responsibility toward non-aligned foreign policy on the other. If we follow the simple formula of aligning with all world powers on matters of economy and development while remaining non-aligned on strategic matters, it will not only help us achieve economic gains but also protect us from strategic tensions and risks.
Are the common people expecting too much from the political parties if they want all political parties to consign their past invectives against each other to history and stand together. If not, let us first make public all the facts related to the SPP through a white paper in the sovereign parliament. After that, let all the major political parties reach an agreement on how to resolve the issue of SPP.
Let the series of abusing and doubting each other on the issue of nationalism and foreign policy be stopped. Let us make Nepal a mature country that does not harm anyone, strongly stand for her interests, participates with everyone economically but remain strategically non-aligned in the eyes of our neighbors and friendly countries.
Are the politicians ready for that?

The committee formed by the government to invstigate the allegations made against Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) Governor Maha Prasad Adhikari reminds of kangaroo courts that autocrats across the world form to persecute their opponents and rivals.
Finance Minister Janardan Sharma has got Adhikari suspended by influencing Prime Minister (PM) Sher Bahadur Deuba due to his ego and prejudice, and got a committee formed through the Cabinet to investigate Adhikari.
Sharma has not been able to publicly defend suspension of governor of an autonomous body like the NRB. Governors are not generally suspended unless they show serious moral depravity or knowingly harm the country. They must never be suspended on the basis of policy differences. 
The NRB can adopt a policy that differs from that of the government based on the needs of the economy. Political parties can disrupt the country's economy in accordance to their short-term interests or political needs. The NRB has been given autonomy precisely to ensure that it can pay attention to stability of the economy through monetary policy to stop that.  
Governor Adhikari had implemented the NRB policies in coordination with the government policies even in practice. The NRB and the government coordinate their policies at normal times and the finance secretary is kept in the NRB board for that purpose.
Adhikari has not acted to harm the economy defying the government or flouting government's instructions. He instead intervened and prevented hike in interest rate for a long time to fulfill the finance minister's wish to increase loan investment by banks keeping a low interest rate, and     raise economic activities and the economic growth rate. That is seen to have increased flow of cheap money into the economy, increased import and put pressure on foreign currency reserves now.
Some policies adopted with good intention can prove to be wrong in the long run and put pressure on the economy. No economy would suffer crisis if all the policies were proved right and accurate prediction of a crisis were possible. There is no country in the world that has never suffered an economic crisis. All the state organs, therefore, should have come together to find a solution to the problem currently facing our economy without blaming anyone.
Finance Minister Sharma instead has alleged Adhikari of not cooperating with the government, harming the economy, leaking important economic information among others to avenge on an absolutely different issue.
It is not hidden from anyone that Sharma has attacked Adhikari after revelations that he took initiative to release the money transferred in the name of Prithvi Bahadur Shah from America that the NRB has frozen after America requested the central bank to investigate and return the amount back to America suspecting that it may have arrived through money laundering or fraud. To take an initiative to release the amount that has been red-flagged by America was a serious mistake on part of the finance minister.
That he got the governor suspended suspecting that Adhikari leaked the information and a committee formed including persons close to him to investigate that shows that he is intent on practicing vigilante justice.
The kind of persons included in the 'kangaroo committee' formed on initiative of Sharma gives away what his intentions are. The committee that Sharma has got constituted through the Cabinet including a former justice who is his relative and two party cadres has ended the possibility of fair investigation of allegations made against the governor and chances for justice.
Constitution of such 'kangaroo committee' has made mockery of justice. Responsibility for that now lies not just with Sharma but Chairman of the Cabinet that formed the 'kangaroo committee' and his party Nepali Congerss (NC). Neither PM Deuba nor NC can now run away from that.
Practising 'kangaroo court' and vigilante justice is not new for the Maoists that had practiced so during the armed insurgency. But how could NC agree for that? It should declare whether any citizen has the right for fair investigation of allegations made against her in a liberal and democratic society it has promised to the people. Whether that is a fundamental right for any citizen in today's Nepal or not?  If yes, why is that right of Governor Adhikari denied? How could a Cabinet meeting attended by PM Deuba form such a 'kangaroo committee' on whims of Minister Sharma? On what basis the Deuba Cabinet endorsed such a decision that attacks the autonomy granted to the NRB and its governor by the law?
These questions raised against PM Deuba and NC led by him are not simple. This Cabinet decision to form the 'kangaroo committee' attacks the very trust that the people have on NC for  the kind of values and norms it swears allegiance to.
The only way to correct the mistake now is to revoke the 'kangaroo committee' and withdraw the suspension of Governor Adhikari. 
NC should mull whether the public trust on it for its values and norms is important or transient interests of ruling coalition and defnse of the finance minister's whims are?

Surgery is considered as one of the very rewarding disciplines providing good amount of personal and professional job satisfaction. Unfortunately, it is also considered as one of the most stressful professions. Both during the period of surgical training as well as clinical practice, people are prone to developing burnout due to excessive stress. Predisposing factors could be multiple. Multiple studies published overseas have demonstrated that the burnout rate among the surgical trainees and practicing surgeons is very high in comparison to other specialties.
Why surgeons are prone to stress?
In surgical specialties, the job demands extreme amount of hard work, both mentally and physically. Besides this, the working hours are extra-long and just not limited to fixed schedules, and the on-call duties are extremely tiring and long. Most of the times the surgeons are dealing with life-and-death situations and one small error either in judgment or skill can prove fatal. At some busy centers the surgeons are overloaded with patients too. Moreover, the training in surgical specialties is extremely prolonged and even after completing their general and specialty trainings they further need supervised working environment to gain good amount of exposure and develop enough confidence. Each individual surgeon can work independently only after that. These prolonged period of training leads to disbalance in their professional and personal life. Similarly, the compulsion to excel both in academics and surgical practice as well as trying to balance with economical aspects are important factors leading to development of burnout among surgeons. Failure to achieve balance in academic, clinical practice and personal life is again the most important factor for the development of stress among surgeons. Sometimes the pressure on the surgeons by the administration to increase performance also adds up the stress among the surgeons who are already prone to stress because of various predisposing factors. Increasing possibility of dealing with litigations in surgical practice is also one of the strongest factors for surgeons to experience stress and develop burnouts.
What is the prevalence of stress among surgeons?
Apart from some anecdotal reports and expert viewpoints, there has been no published study on this subject matter in Nepal till date. This is one of the very important areas to be researched in Nepal as surgical training and clinical practice in surgical specialties are increasingly becoming very challenging and competitive, and also invite risk of litigations. The number of surgeons in the country has also significantly increased. One US study published in “Surgery” journal in 2001, University of Michigan-Ann Arbor, did a survey on 582 surgeons. Overall, 32% surgeons showed high levels of emotional exhaustion, 13% depersonalization and 4% showed low sense of personal accomplishment. Young surgeons were found to be more vulnerable to suffering stress. Similarly, another Australian study published in ANZ journal of Surgery in 2007 evaluated 126 Surgeons. They found that the surgeons were suffering high level of burnout than the general population. Around 48% of the surgeons surveyed reported high burnout levels. Besides these published reports, there are plenty of other overseas publications supporting the fact that the surgeons are very prone to developing burnout and suffering from stress. It has also been found that the experienced surgeons are more likely to have higher management ability as compared to those younger ones and with fewer years of experience.
What is the effect of stress among surgeons?
Burnout and stress can spill over to personal and professional life. Burnouts can lead to emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and low personal accomplishment. Besides this, stress can be significant contributor to poor health of a surgeon. Anxiety and depression can both be a reason for serious health issues among very stressed and burnt out surgeons. Suffering from broken relationships to drug and alcohol dependence can be a serious issue and at extreme situations they are also prone to suicidal tendencies in lack of timely intervention. Stress and burnout lead to imbalance between personal and professional life which further adds to the suffering of already stressed surgeons and this vicious cycle can continue. Job performance further deteriorates in those surgeons already under stress. This can in fact affect the outcome of the patients being treated. Thus, stress and burnouts have serious consequences which are not just limited to the surgeon suffering from it but also can affect the patient being treated and overall health services of a center.
How can we prevent that?
Despite the high prevalence of stress and burnout among surgeons, there are still ways to reduce it although it can’t be completely avoided. There is no best way to prevent it because it needs to be individualized based on every individual’s working condition, environment, job responsibilities and personalities besides many other factors to be considered. There are plenty of ways described in various published literatures to reduce and prevent stress among surgeons and surgical trainees which could in fact be applied to any other specialty too. The past experience of handling the stressful situation can be adopted even during surgical training periods and in clinical practice too. Identifying priorities both in personal and professional life is a must. One should understand and know one's limits as to what extent to be devoted to surgery. It may not be very applicable during training but definitely an important issue to be considered while practicing as a professional surgeon. Not everyone can do everything and one should understand one's limits and potential. Getting inspired from others is definitely rewarding but comparing oneself to others can unnecessarily increase the stress. Trying to balance between clinical, academic and personal life which also includes the financial aspects is a must. Running after one single aspect is definitely going to be non-rewarding and there is possibility of developing stressful situation due to self-understood reasons. Working in a team, sharing responsibilities and asking for help whenever required are of utmost importance in preventing stress and burnout among surgeons. A very supporting family can definitely help dealing with stressful situations. However, not everyone could be lucky enough to have a very understanding family or a colleague. Reading articles, publications and books on stress management can also help significantly.  For those having a concerning level of stress and burnouts participation in formal stress management training programs and also getting timely medical interventions can help. From the administrative perspective, imposing scientifically correct working hours and workloads both on trainees and practicing surgeons can help avoid unnecessary stress and decrease burnouts among these vulnerable population.
In conclusion, surgery is a very rewarding yet stressful discipline due to various reasons and surgeons both as trainees and practicing surgeons are prone to developing burnout and suffering stress. This can have various consequences not just limited to individual but also affecting the whole system. Thus, efforts should be made at the individual level to the level of administrators and stakeholders to prevent and reduce the prevalence of stress and burnout among surgical trainees and practicing surgeons which then will help in creating a safe working environment for service providers as well as increasing the patient safety.

The context
Public policy in general is conceptual roadmap for government to address specific public concerns and/or deliver specific constitutional mandates and it provides framework for ensuring legal, institutional, procedural, and resources (both human and financial) required to deliver the commitments of the particular public policy. Effectiveness of Nepal’s public polices has to be examined within this definitional framework.
For the past two years, I am heavily engaged in reviewing public polices, comparing different existing public polices and reviewing several new draft polices prepared by different ministries and government agencies. This process helped to understand how they are formulated, why they are formulated in that particular way, how effective they are implemented and why they fail. In this article I am reflecting on why public polices often fail in Nepal.
Reasons of public policies’ failure 
I found the following major reasons of ineffectiveness or even failure of public polices in Nepal:

Weakness in the policy formulation process: Lack of proper need assessment and weak prioritization, no sincere risk and opportunities assessment, not even proper definition of policy, no proper consultation with key stakeholders to collect their concerns and voices resulting in lack of ownership, very top-down process leading to few formal activities to meet the legal/procedural requirement, time pressure for quick delivery of policy, etc. Right policy formulation process often leads to higher possibility for effective implementation and vice versa. Hence, one of the major reasons of failure of public policy is lack of adopting right process.


Inconsistencies in content of policy formulation: Once there is lack of proper need identification, analysis and prioritization, appropriate risk assessment, lack of conceptual clarity in absence of definition, there is always possibility of inconsistencies and flaws/vagueness in the content. Because of lack of conceptual clarity, the whole document as well as individual policy statement is called policy. Many times the logical sequencing between a) policy statement, b) strategies and c) implementing guidelines are weak or missing, very vague statements with similar meaning are presented in policy statements, strategies and implementing guidelines.


Institutional mechanism: In most of the polices, there is no clear responsibilities of responsible institutions outlined and agreed, thereby creating confusion and lack of ownership in implementation. Most of the polices require engagement of several inter-ministerial institutions. Policies brought by one ministry with the responsibilities of implementation on another ministry is one of the main reasons for dysfunction.


Legal provisions: Several policy provisions demand legal back up for successful implementation. But most of the polices are prepared without proper assessment of legal situation (does any existing law inhibit implementation, is new law required to implement the policy etc.). Hence, once policy is formulated, many existing laws prohibit (e.g., forest law or park and people law) implementation or new laws are required. This situation must be assessed while making policy and clear legal provisions required to implement specific policy must be outlined in the policy. Further, unlike laws, there is no provision of punishment to concerned officials if he or she fails to implement particular policy resulting in impunity for lack of implementation.


Coordination: Lack of inter-ministerial and inter-agency coordination is another big barrier to implementing policy effectively, as scope of most of the policies (e.g., agriculture policy, urban development policy, water, sanitation and hygiene policy, etc.) goes beyond the remit of single ministry (eg, agriculture, irrigation, industries, trade and supply, finance, foreign affairs, home affairs ministries are related with agriculture policy). Hence, if proper consultation with concerned ministers at the beginning of policy formulation is not done and clear commitment not ensured, policy will not work.


Resources provisions: Many policies at the time of formulation do not assess the tentative financial and human resources requirements. Without proper projection of resources required for implementing the policy, possibility of its failure is high.
Time required for public policy formulation: Often Nepal’s public policies are formulated in a very short time (few weeks to hardly a few months) leaving aside important public consultation process because of pressure from minsters leading ultimately to lack of public ownership and failure. Depending on the gravity of topic, time span for a policy formulation process requires nine months and up to 10 years (for policies’ that are directly related with a large number of people, such as agriculture/health and sanitation, etc.).


Monitoring and evaluation: Most of the policies mention about monitoring and evaluation but there are no indicators (what to monitor/evaluate), no time frame (when to do), and assigning of responsibility. So, it remains simply a jargon statement.


Supplementary elaborations and documents: Complex polices require supplementary documents (strategies, guidelines, procedures etc.) that are not indicated in the policies but affect policy implementation.

Way ahead
Existing practice of policy formulation must be changed if we want to see public policy implemented. In this context, Policy Research Institute (PRI) has developed two guidelines related to public polices: one related to formulation of public polices and another related to reviewing public policies, to assist government ministries. Very brief synopsis of public policy formulation cycle is presented below:
Public Policy Formulation to follow the ‘Public Policy Formation Cycle’ that starts with

identification and analysis of policy issues,
prioritization of policy issues,
preliminary draft as per the standard format (developed by Policy Research Institute),
call for the public to give feedback and public dialogue over the preliminary draft,
revision of the preliminary draft based on the public feedback,
review of the revised draft by team of experts and adaptation of draft,
circulation at the public level for their comments and feedback on the draft (sending to all key stakeholders and requesting for their feedback and organization of a series of feedback meetings with stakeholders),
revision of the draft policy for finalization,
submission of the draft to cabinet committee for approval,
policy implementation,
policy evaluation (after 5 years of implementation) and decision of continuity, revision or need for new policy.

Completion of this process generally requires about nine months and in case of policies dealing with the concerns of large population such as health policy, agriculture policy, drinking water and sanitation policies and education policies years of continuous consultation and public debate is required. Now Nepal needs to change the present practice of policy formulation in terms of process, content, expected outcomes.

The country is currently polarized over the US$ 500 million grant the American government is providing through the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC). The MCC Compact signed between Nepal and America four years ago have yet to come into implementation in lack of ratification by the House.
The American government has already said that the amount will be given to another country if the MCC Compact is not ratified by the House by February end. The act of picking controversy over a grant agreement with a friendly nation four years after signing the agreement shows how pathetic and irresponsible our diplomacy is. Such an important issue that needs to be discussed in the House has not even been taken to the House.
The dispute, therefore, has reached the streets and even the dining table of the people. The politicians stayed mere spectators instead of becoming serious about such an important issues related to the country's future.  This further compounded matters. The MCC Compact should be tabled in the House without any delay and lawmakers should take a decision using their wisdom.
The then prime minister (PM) KP Sharma Oli had registered the MCC for discussion in the House when he led the CPN government. But the then speaker Krishna Bahadur Mahara did not allow discussion in the House on instruction of Pushpa Kamal Dahal who was chairman of ruling CPN along with Oli.
Agni Sapkota, who shares Maoist background with Mahara, also did not hold discussion amidst power struggle inside CPN after he became speaker. He did not just deny the government the right to take any bill or proposal of its choice to the House but also obstructed exercise of the sovereign right of the lawmakers elected by the people to hold discussion on those issues. This is unpardonable on the part of Sapkota in capacity of speaker. Speaker Sapkota should now take the MCC Compact for discussion without any excuse and delay. Whether to end the House obstruction for discussion or not is up to CPN-UML. He cannot shirk his responsibility pointing at UML.
Many political leaders have been irresponsible on the issue of MCC. CPN (Maoist Center) Chair Dahal has been the most irresponsible among the top leaders. He generally has a dual position on any issue. He has this habit of saying one thing one day and exactly the opposite the next day on any issue irrespective of gravity of the issue. He unfortunately swung like a pendulum even on the issue of MCC and bilateral relation with America.
He made a sensitive issue like MCC a tool for his power struggle inside the party in the beginning. He had said the MCC Compact will be ratified by the House in Kantipur Conclave a few years back. But he first used Mahara and then Sapkota, and stopped MCC's entry in the House as his relation with Oli soured.
Nepali Congress (NC) President Sher Bahadur Deuba had asked Dahal about the MCC Compact before forging the alliance to unseat Oli from pemiership. Deuba actually wanted to form the coalition government only after getting the MCC Compact ratified. Dahal had promised his party's support to pass the MCC Compact after forming the coalition government. But Dahal started to make conflicting remarks about MCC once the new government was formed. He claimed that he is not in favor of passing it inside his party even as he swore his support for the agreement with American officials. He told Deuba that he needs more time to convince comrades inside his party.
Dahal penned a joint letter to the MCC on September 29, 2021 along with PM Deuba after American officials said they will take back the amount if it is not endorsed by the House, and sought four-five months to create a favorable environment for MCC inside his party and in the country. He also promised to get the MCC Compact ratified in his official meetings with American officials in the intervening period. He did not raise the issue of amending the agreement in the joint letter sent to the MCC or during the multiple meetings with American officials. But he continued to tell leaders inside his party that the MCC Compact cannot be passed without amendment. So much so that he got the party's stance endorsed by the recent general convention. 
How can a top leader of a major party and a former PM act so irresponsibily? The country has suffered a huge loss due to his dual character. But he himself and his party has suffered an even greater loss due to that. Dahal continued to sell the dream of rebellion and state capture to the rank and file even after he gave up the armed rebellion and joined peaceful politics. He mentally sailed the two boats of peace and rebellion.
He and his party would have been in a far better position in Nepali politics now had he focused on transforming his party for peaceful politics and seeking resolution to the political, social and economic issues facing the country through the House right from the beginning. He has not even imagined the harm the dual nature he is showing now on the issue of MCC has incurred for him. He will face the consequences if he does not mend his ways.
The main opposition UML has also resorted to politicking on the issue of MCC in recent times. UML has put the party's interests above that of the country's even  though it may not be as shameless as Dahal's. As the issue of MCC gets trickier, there is risk of conflict of powerful countries intensifying inside Nepal and the country getting in a geopolitical tangle. That is not an issue of concern for just one party.
If all the parties come together, we cannot just evade the potential geopolitical mess but also have the opportunity of moving forward with a foreign policy based on a balanced relations with all the powerful countries. The country currently needs cognizance and cooperation from all the parties. But UML is busy counting its political gains and losses.
Setopati has always been clear on the issue of ratifying the MCC Compact. America definitely may have its strategic interest in the MCC just as China may have in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI|) and India in any other development project. But Nepal has not done any strategic deal in the MCC Compact it has signed. We will be bound only by the MCC Compact in the coming days. The issues mentioned in the MCC Compact are purely related only to development projects—construction of transmission lines essential for Nepal, and repair and maintenance of the roads.
There are many reasons for the issues in the agreement being dragged into controversy. Many do not know anything about this agreement. They have not even read the agreement but are opposing it on the basis of hearsay. Some are opposing in lack of understanding about how international treaties and agreements are drafted and their meaning. Some are not familiar about the language used in deals about development projects and are opposing it. Still others are opposing by misinterpreting the meaning of English language used in the agreement. And some are opposing it due to their prejudice.
The MCC Office has already sent written response to all the questions raised about the MCC. The MCC Compact itself has a provision allowing both Nepal and America to unilaterally revoke the deal giving a 30-day notice if they have any grievances regarding implementation of the Compact. We will always reserve the rights to walk away from the agreement giving a 30-day notice if Nepal does not agree with anything or America puts pressure to that regard after the MCC Compact comes into implementation. We must, therefore, get the MCC Compact ratified through the House and take it into implementation without any apprehension.  
Setopati is also clear about the issue of geopoliitcs. Nepal will have to maintain cordial and close relation with all the neighboring and powerful countries, and use that to our benefits.
We should not oppose any country for the sake of another, and not allow any to interfere in the relation with another. India wanted Nepal to not sign the BRI and had even quietly lobbied for that. We had said we should sign the BRI with China even then. We are also clear that we should build better relation with the northern neighbor. We should not allow India or America to interfere in our relation with China just like we should not allow China to covertly or overtly interfere in our relation with India or America.  
Only that will provide an opportunity for us to maintain close relation with all the powerful countries and reap benefits from that. Nepal will become a playground for powerful countries if Nepal supports or opposes any country for the sake of another. That will spell trouble for us in the long run. 
The lawmakers, therefore, should think seriously about the issue and take a decision based on their wisdom. The people have elected lawmakers prescisely to discuss and decide about such important and tricky issues. They should fulfill that responsibility handed over by the electorate.

Nepali politics has suddenly become heated in the middle of the winter on the issue of when to hold parliamentary and local elections. Different positions of the parties have been made public while the Constitution and election laws are also being interpreted differently.
Parties are currently making different interpretations of Article 225 of the Constitution and clause 3 of the Local Election Act.
Article 225 states that the term of rural assembly and municipal assembly will be five years, and election for the next rural assembly and municipal assembly should be held within six months of end of that term.
Clause 3 of the Local Election Act, on the other hand, states that members will be elected two months before the term of rural assembly and municipal assembly expires.
CPN (Maoist Center) Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal has argued that local election can be held in November-December pointing that the Constitution prevails if provision of other laws contradict the Constituion.
Some legal experts point that the Constitution and the election act talk about rural assembly and municipal assembly and not rural municipality and municipality.
Election of 753 rural and municipal assemblies can be, and have been, held on separate days depending on the choice and convenience of elected local representatives. The experts point that there would have been no dispute now if the act had mentioned that election should be held two months before the term of member of rural municipality and municipal expires.  
No matter how the parties interpret these provisions now, we all know that the parties were careful about two things at the time of promulgating the Constitution.
One is the term of local bodies will be five years and the local bodies will not be left without leadership in lack of election due to the bitter experience of local bodies remaining without elected people's representatives for around two decades. The leaders were as careful about local bodies not remaning without leadership as they were about the House not being dissolved before completing its five-year term.
Another is ruling parties should not unilaterally change election date, and basic laws like election laws, laws about splitting political parties and appointment at constitutional bodies because they are directly related to the institution and system of democracy. If there is no discussion and consensus among the parties represented in the House about such issues, that derails the system and institution itself.
We had, therefore, strongly protested when KP Sharma Oli unilaterally amended the laws about splitting political parties and appointment at constitutional bodies when he was prime minister (PM) to serve his narrow interest.
The ruling coalition seems to be trying to amend election laws and change election date due to similar self-interests. The ruling coalition has its own onterests in first holding the federal election in April-May and the local election in November-December.
The ruling coalition cannot ally in all 753 local bodies as cadres of Nepali Congress (NC) will not allow that. CPN (Unified Socialist) and even Maoist Center will struggle to win local bodies if the parties in the coalition ally.
The ruling alliance will be under huge psychological pressure if the two communist parties fare poorly in the local election. NC does not want the two parties to seem weak before the general election. If the two parties seem weaker, that will benefit CPN-UML and hurt NC's prospects in the general election.
The ruling alliance may also feel that vacancy in the local bodies will benefit the coalition as UML had won at more places than other parties in the last local election.
Sher Bahadur Deuba has been accused of keeping the local bodies without elected leadership for two decades in the past. PM Deuba should not lead the act of keeping local bodies without elected leadership even this time.
There are many things that need to be reformed in the election process. Holding election of all three levels of government together will not just save the state's coffers in election expenditure but also mean that decisions about development projects, transfer and promotion of staffers and other issues need not be stopped repeatedly due to the election code of conduct that comes into effect before the election.
There are many such issues that the parties represented in the parliament have to sit together and agree for electoral reform to make our democracy more  polished. There will definitely be a solution if the parties sit together and agree to hold the three elections together either in April-May or November-December.
But the ruling coalition should not unilaterally amend election laws or push back the election date if the parties to fail to agree on these issues. There should be local election in April-May and provincial and federal elections in November-December if there is no consensus.  
The government should not again invite political  mayhem by deciding otherwise.

Industry Minister Gajendra Hamal has resigned 40 hours after appointment. Hamal has said he has resigned listening to his conscience after widespread criticism of the appointment. Baluwatar has tried to spin the resignation by Hamal of his own volition to save its face. The press note issued by Baluwatar mentions that Hamal has resigned on request of Prime Minister (PM) Sher Bahadur Deuba even as audio recording of Hamal requesting to broadcast/publish the issue through the media pointing that Deuba may reject his resignation has been made public.
One fact has been irrefutably established despite all the efforts of damage control by Baluwatar. The democracy in Nepal has been attacked in an unimaginable manner last week.
Politicians and people in the judiciary can some time commit mistakes in course of work and do work that should not be done. But the deed of PM Deuba and Chief Justice (CJ) Cholendra Shumsher Rana with consent of the top leaders of ruling coalition is an unthinkable crime in democracy. CJ seeking share of spoils in the government and the ruling parties accepting that is unimaginable in democracy.
The main source of this misdeed is CJ Rana, and his unconstitutional aspirations. Rana had the temerity to seek a share in power violating the sanctity of judiciary believing he can do anything he wishes.
The ruling coalition should have strongly resisted this impudence by CJ Rana. But the coalition easily accepted his demand reflecting at once the gratitude of the coalition toward some of the past verdicts by CJ and fear that he may put the government in another crisis.
Rana has been enjoying the fallout of the havoc he has wreaked from the sacred chair of CJ and making mockery of democracy. It is not hard to see that Rana has been influencing the court’s verdicts in a way that benefits one party or another, and reaping political benefits for that.
Two major verdicts by the Supreme Court (SC) in cases related to political parties are now under suspicion. The SC verdict to revoke unification of CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Center) restoring the two parties to the state before unification in a case related to the unified party using name of another registered party was against the Constitution, laws and jurisdiction of the judiciary. That verdict was unimaginable.  
The refusal by the SC to issue an interim order in the case against the ordinance making splitting of parties easier issued hastily by the Deuba government after suddenly ending the House session, and subsequent delay in issuing final verdict in the case have also raised suspicions. Every government has undermined the parliament by bringing ordinance and tampered with laws for its vested interests. There will be no meaning of democratic norms of the people’s representatives formulating laws and the rule of law if that is not controlled.
The SC recently had revoked the ordinance brought by the KP Oli government to amend the act related to citizenship immediately after dissolving the House. The court had done a commendable job of curbing the autocratic tendency of the executive to rule through ordinances by avoiding the parliament. The final verdict in that case would have set a good precedent and curbed abuse of powers bolstering democracy and rule of law.
But the SC has again treaded the wrong path in the case related to the ordinance about splitting of parties. The SC has blatantly ignored the precedent it established in the ordinance related to citizenship. The double standard of the Apex Court in cases related to two similar ordinances has not just hit the credibility of the judiciary but raised suspicions that CJ Rana influences court verdicts to serve his immoral interests in connivance with political parties. CJ Rana has himself proved the suspicions to be true by accepting his share in Cabinet expansion.
Opposing such immoral acts of CJ is not opposing the judiciary or attacking the dignity of the court. The judiciary is not an individual justice or CJ, for that matter, who does not remain within the limits and disregards the sanctity of the judiciary.
Condemning such justices rather saves the judiciary and all those honest justices who continuously work with constitutional integrity and cannot even think about treading the path Rana has taken. Slamming Rana will save the justices who twice revived the House dissolved unconstitutionally by Oli going against Rana’s wishes. Criticizing Rana will safeguard the public trust over those very justices who have not participated in the political dealmaking of Rana.
We should not forget here that CJ Rana agreed to reinstate the House for the first time only after three justices in the five-strong constitutional bench stood for House reinstatement. Two justices refused to stay in the constitutional bench formed by CJ Rana in the case against the second dissolution by Oli. The rest of the justices then forced Rana to constitute the bench on the basis of seniority. The constitutional bench formed on the basis of seniority then reinstated the House.  
The current transgression by Rana has provided an opportunity to UML leaders to claim that the verdict for House reinstatement was also given on the basis of political machination. Rana in this way has not just dragged other SC justices working with honesty and integrity into suspicion but also gravely reduced the credibility of the judiciary.
CJ Rana would have deserved impeachment if politicians at the top were not complicit in such grave crimes. Merely demanding share in government would be sufficient to impeach a CJ in a well-functioning democracy. But our politicians are so lowly and decadent that they are condemned to fulfilling the quota demanded by CJ in appointments in the government and constitutional bodies. Oli gave Rana share in appointments in constitutional bodies when he was PM. Deuba gave Rana a share even in the Cabinet this time.
Our politicians will not muster moral courage to impeach Rana due to this background. The responsibility to resist the immoral deeds of Rana is now on the judiciary itself. The SC justices, the Nepal Bar Association, and the SC Bar Association must seriously carry out consultations. Such incidents erode the legitimacy of democracy and undermine rule of law, and the courageous stand of people with integrity and honesty at such times will instill life in democracy and save democracy.
Nepali Congress (NC) that considers itself to be the mother of parliamentary democracy in Nepal and its leaders and cadres also have a huge responsibility. Maoist Center Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who does not respect or believe in parliamentary democracy a bit, defending Hamal’ appointment is not surprising because he believes all the means toward climbing to power and staying are fair. But NC leaders and cadres should seriously contemplate whether corruption of the executive by an immoral and whimsical CJ is acceptable in parliamentary democracy or not? Whether the party president who has committed such a grave attack and crime against democracy is acceptable or not? Whether the party president can continue to lead the party and government in the coming days or not? Why should the Nepali people bear with Deuba who undermines democracy, Constitution and the party ideals every time he reaches power even if the party leaders and cadres consider him fit to be party president? Why should NC under Deuba again be sent to the government?
The coming days will show how people in the judiciary retaliate against CJ’s arbitrariness or those in NC will resist Deuba. But one thing is absolutely clear. Deuba and Rana, and not Hamal, are the ones who should be punished in this episode. The attack on democracy by PM Deuba and CJ Rana, who have repeatedly failed to maintain clean image even in the past, this time has plummeted their image to the nadir of ignominy. History will not absolve them of this ignominy.

The Nepal Academy has recently published photojournalist Bharat Bandhu Thapa's picture book 'Nepal in Pictures'.
The 320-page book includes over 500 photographs depicting tourism, arts, culture and society from Mechi in the east to Mahakli in the west and the height of Mt Everest to the lowlands of Kechanakaval. 
""My objective was to ensure that those who want to know Nepal get to see the main views and know the main specialties of the country in a single book. I was, therefore, working on it for a long time,"" Thapa tells Setopati. ""Nepal is such a big country that it is not possible to include the whole country in 320 pages. But I have tried to include different possibilities of the country as far as I know in this book.""
He added that the book will be polished further in the future. 
The pictures in the books depict places from Olangchung Gola in the east to Kalapani in the Far West, Khaptad, Badimalika, Upper Dolpo, Lumbini, Janaki Temple, Shukaphant to the culture of the Kathmandu Valley. ""Most of the pictures in the book have been clicked by me. But I have not travelled across the whole country. I was undecided about whether to include the places I have not visited or not,"" he reveals. ""I finally decided that those places should not be excluded from the book even if I have not visited.""
He has sought photos of those places from his friends and says that has prevented the book from being incomplete.

The Nepal Academy has recently published photojournalist Bharat Bandhu Thapa's picture book 'Nepal in Pictures'.
The 320-page book includes over 500 photographs depicting tourism, arts, culture and society from Mechi in the east to Mahakli in the west and the height of Mt Everest to the lowlands of Kechanakaval. 
""My objective was to ensure that those who want to know Nepal get to see the main views and know the main specialties of the country in a single book. I was, therefore, working on it for a long time,"" Thapa tells Setopati. ""Nepal is such a big country that it is not possible to include the whole country in 320 pages. But I have tried to include different possibilities of the country as far as I know in this book.""
He added that the book will be polished further in the future. 
The pictures in the books depict places from Olangchung Gola in the east to Kalapani in the Far West, Khaptad, Badimalika, Upper Dolpo, Lumbini, Janaki Temple, Shukaphant to the culture of the Kathmandu Valley. ""Most of the pictures in the book have been clicked by me. But I have not travelled across the whole country. I was undecided about whether to include the places I have not visited or not,"" he reveals. ""I finally decided that those places should not be excluded from the book even if I have not visited.""
He has sought photos of those places from his friends and says that has prevented the book from being incomplete.

It appears that the current generation of loving couples getting married in Nepal in an urban context are enchanted and enthralled by the idea of a soulmate. Hence, the idea of someone being your soulmate keeps trending on different social networking sites as an ideal version of being in love together. Although the current generation of loving couples has an idealized image of a soulmate, in reality, for many people, the idea of finding and living with a social mate remains limited to mere appearances—just a tagline posted along with a visual representation of togetherness shared on different social networking sites.
Our everyday idea about the soulmate falls short of its ideals because we rely on imitations of plastic images of love trending in different mediums of pop culture, compare and contrast our possible loving partners with superficial expressions of other loving couples, and also follow the suggestions and guidelines of other people to identify and determine our soulmate. Similarly, we have misguided expectations about a soulmate as someone who brings a sense of security and feelings of comfort, along with the promise of everlasting love, into our lives.
Besides, our criteria for falling in love with another person are such that we give more preference and priority to what the person has, like a bank balance, a green card, a dependent visa, social status, and a handsome or beautiful face, than to who he or she is as a person with inner human qualities such as honesty, trustworthiness, understanding, commitment, and caring.
Many people miss their soulmates because they are so out of touch with their inner lives as individuals that they remain unaware of the person who is carrying the beats of her heart inside his own. Soulmates get married because they are for each other, not for any other reason.
More importantly, without anything as such to connect with, enrich, and nourish a loving relationship together from within, being in love without a soulmate becomes utterly boring, shallow, lost in appearances, and meaningless. Being in love without a soulmate is a tedious struggle of finding one temporary delight after another in the outer world to justify and demonstrate the shallow and soulless love people have for each other.
The idea of each of us having a soulmate was first put forth by Greek philosopher Plato, who in his seminal work Symposium stated that each of us has another half of our own soul in another physical body; hence, as human beings, we have this inner, irresistible yearning for that interconnection with another being that would make us feel undivided and complete, and as long as soulmates remain separated, there will always be an inner sense of lack, as if things are missing out, out of touch, shallow, and incomplete.
Similarly, in Hindu religious tradition, we have the divine union between Goddess Parvati and Lord Shiva as Shiva and Shakti expressed in a singular being, Ardhanarishwar; this mythological narrative is a symbolic representation of reunion between soulmates. Indeed, the struggles and sacrifices of Devi Parvati to belong with Lord Shiva indicate that when it comes to a spiritual journey to find a soulmate, it is not about what other people say or what options or preferences you have; to find a soulmate, you must exercise your freedom, follow your inner voice and its determination, and stand strong with your courage. First, you have to connect and stand firm on your true self to find your true lover.
Hence, to get in touch with your soulmate, first of all, you need to listen to the soft whisper reverberating from your heart that gently tells you she may not be the charming person of your dreams, but it feels as if even as strangers, we have already met for thousands of times. There may have been other lovers of youth, beauty, possession, admiration, and passion, but only she can reach deep inside your heart and understand you just the way you are.
Finding your soulmate would be like stumbling onto someone you are surprised to realize has been shaped and carved like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle that fit together only with you. With your soulmate, you get that feeling of being at ease within yourself, and there is no need for any other stimulus or incentive apart from each other’s presence to get a sense of interconnection out of this relationship.
Moreover, soulmates are two individuals who have realized that promising romantic love forever is a lie. Falling in love is easy, but the art of remaining committed to each other in love takes many years of practice to perfect. Even when their love is the glue that binds them together, soulmates understand that for their relationship to last, they need to support each other's motivations, interests, and inspirations and find commonalities between them.
Being in love as soulmates means that we are both willing to make struggles and sacrifices for each other because we both realize that our love has the potential to improve, transform, redefine, and make the best out of our lives altogether. Besides, soulmates don’t play the game of pretending to remain at the center of each other’s attention, and they don't want the other person to become the shadow of their expectations, anticipations, and projections.
To conclude, soulmates are two individuals with a sense of shared self that allows them to blend in, support, and sustain each other's beings together. Where there are differences, soulmates supplement and become each other’s inspiration and strength, and where there are similarities, they explore, enhance, and enjoy their mutual interests and passions together. When soulmates sit together and engage in laughter, dialogue, making love, silence, or discussions, they realize that their loving relationship gives their lives a sense of purpose together, which makes them feel complete and inseparable from each other.

Those words from my lovely wife ended our argument in the kitchen last night.
The night before that, a minor difference in opinion had flickered into a tiny spark and by the time Hegel got involved the next day, it had turned into an inferno.
Before we move on, let’s get to know a little about Hegel so it can help us understand where these two loving souls, my wife and I, usually depart and seldom meet again.
Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel was a German Philosopher and was considered as the most important figures in German philosophy and one of the founding figures of modern Western philosophy. Leaving all the things he’s said aside, the one thing that has struck a chord with me is his theory on “shape of consciousness”. 
Hegel says simply put, we cannot trust the certitude of our sense organs, also called sense-certainty, because that certitude is embroiled in limitations. Add to that, the human consciousness, and language upon which all sense-making is forced. That leaves no room for subjective agency. Our means of understanding our reality are encouraged, sustained, inspired, and tolerated by those sets of very weak and humanistic attributes. We are flawed in our take of our reality because the moment we set our eyes on something, it takes a form of what it means for us. 
Not what it is in its real essence, but what it means to a human mind.
Imagine a botanist, a wood cutter and a CEO of a furniture company taking a walk in a forest. What they see when they look around are trees and nothing but trees. 
In essence what a tree is, in-itself, they will never know. They cannot catch themselves seeing those trees from anywhere else beyond what their human mind lets them see.
The botanist will see the trees in terms of cambiums and apical meristem. 
The woodcutter will see those trees in terms of his livelihood and his children’s tuition.
The CEO will see them in terms of how many desks his company could produce from the wood of those trees.
The tree’s essence, what it is, and why it is what it is, can never find a place of its individuality because the human mind, limited within its Hegelian purview, will eat up that possibility before anything else.
The tree can never be a tree in itself. Instead, it must be a tree for those three people.
Thomas Nagel, one of my other to-go thinkers wrote a paper back in 1974 titled ‘What is it like to be a bat?’ There is no amount of knowledge or information about a bat that can tell us what it feels like to be a bat within the confines of its bat consciousness. 
Its hunger, its love, its breezing along the meandering swoops and its revulsions against other fellow bats--those we shall never know. The best we could do is anthropomorphize it, like we always do in animation movies where animals tend to live up to human aspirations. 
A human mind is incapable of experiencing a bat’s experience and therefore will never know how a bat might feel. There simply is not a way for anyone of us to know. Let’s be totally asserted on that truth.
In the similar manner, a botanist, a woodcutter, and my lovely wife, how’s their experience any more different from the run-down of that bat’s experience we could relate to?
Fundamentally, their personal experience that’s accessible only to them, be it during the stroll in the forest or the grunt in the kitchen, are theirs to have. I can sit here and try to relativize a woodcutter’s coveting or my wife’s annoyances, but that won’t move the dial if their shape of consciousness is absent from my reach. I can never know how she feels if I can’t own her in totality.
And this is where Hegel comes along to enlighten the predicament of the misrepresentations that becomes a foundational springboard in understanding the shape of the other person’s consciousness.
Our minds, our feelings and everything we claim as ours are cusped within the confines of our personal sense-making. Our experiences become relatable only if we can find a medium to universalize it in terms of human graces or grunts.
I don’t know if Hegel can truly do my wife’s dishes or not.
I am positive he will not because he died long before both of us were born.
Nonetheless, Hegel does remind us that in absence of common reference, our words will fail us miserably. 
And when that happens our silence, perhaps, will hold more meaning.

A dear friend that I have known for decades took his life last week leaving behind a wife, two children and many of us who have not been able to claim back our sanity. There are ten thousand unrelenting questions that are hitting hard on us, and they are not easily going away. It’s been an unsettling week for all of us.
When a tragedy like this happens, it doesn’t take place amidst the clamor of reason and resonance.
Instead, a decision like this is made in the retreat of a cool, calm, and collected mind. At least, that’s what Karl Menninger meditates in ‘Man against Himself’, a brilliant psychiatrist who tries to comprehend why an individual wishes to put himself in a harm’s way from which he cannot, except by suicide, escape from his life.
In other words, if for his own unconscious purpose, a man brings about an apparent justification in external reality for self-destruction, then the unconscious purposes are of more significance in understanding the suicide than the apparently simple, inevitable, external circumstance that are observable to the public. For folks like you and me, the laziest and the most reckless way to make sense of someone’s decision is to try to understand his subjective decision from an objective point of view.
What Menninger is saying humbly is this.
What happens out there are particles simply hitting each other and producing a state of affairs that, when viewed from a frog’s point of view or a bird eye-view, are nothing but occasions passing along space and time. However, when we introduce a human mind to that same state of affairs, everything changes. 
Humans carry an unhealthy number of covenants, rules, positivity, and ought-to-be-ness that sometimes are anti-life. It works more against them than for them. 
In essence, what kills a man under such circumstances is not what’s out there in the world but what’s within him. His provisional compass becomes the contingent arbiter, the judge, the jury, and the noose that can take away his life. At least, that’s what happened with my friend, it looks like.
I can only imagine or perhaps not, what must have gone through his mind in those last forlorn moments of despair and disquietude. I will never find out how many sins he thought he had committed when he compared his external world to Bhagavat Geeta that espouses on being a good human being. I will never find out how much short he found himself in the eyes of Hindu Gods and other deities that had, in his last moments, become toxic for him.
Jordan Peterson is a clinical psychiatrist who perhaps is the most articulate man alive on our planet- at least that’s what the New York Times quotes him to be. 
Peterson makes an appeal to all, not to advise another human being on what should or should not be done, simply because you may screw up that person’s life. It doesn’t matter where such guidance comes from. 
Be it from the voice from heaven or from the Apollo of Delphi or from our own Krishna’s chariots from Kurukshetra. Where they come from is irrelevant but what they render to a human mind is absolutely calamitous.
These oracular voices tend to be more harmful and are totally responsible for human suffering. They create a paradigm in men upon which he is constrained to build up his sense of right and wrong. And life, as you all know, is a roller coaster ride, simply because there’s always a chance for us to spill out of that paradigm. 
Our agency, perhaps our only tool to understand the reality may not always square perfectly with Bhagavad Gita’s diatribes against the sins that men are capable of committing. And that is exactly why no one should be damned because none can control the reality of the world. There seems no room for agency in a world of neural impulses, chemical reactions, and bone and muscle movements. Even if we add sensations, perceptions, and feelings we don’t get action, or doing—there is only what happens.
Under such conditions, my friend who perhaps didn’t find his external reality 'squarely checked’ with his internal covenants saw no point in prolonging his life because he must have gotten lost on his way with no structure to guide him through. The virtues that he adhered so deeply had no place in the world he found himself in. The gods were gone.
He must have found himself in that forlorn Nietzschean world where god lived no more.
There were two ways to fix his problem from what I can tell.
First one was to fix the reality which essentially meant to reorganize the particles that was noumenally visible to him so it would evenly square with his virtues. 
The second was to kill the gods so the world would become livable where he could breathe again.
Unfortunately, both options were not available to him. And the one that he did choose, only that made all the difference to him.

With the massive popularity and abundance of spiritual leaders, gurus, religious groups, religious media channels, and self-help publications, the concept of spirituality has become an integral part of our collective psyche. As a result, many people believe that spiritual perspectives, techniques, and exercises can be applied to solve various mental health issues and educational and behavioral problems in modern society and influence people to make healthy lifestyle choices and meaningful life decisions. However, most often, I find this term overused, misused, confused, and even utterly commercialized.
For example, gurus, meditation teachers, mystics, yogic masters, and preachers package their spiritual techniques and craft their presence in such a way that their spiritual teaching resonates as informative, entertaining, alluring, and incentivized for a specific age group, gender, generation, profession, and for people with a specific way of life, attitude, and purchasing power. And these days, spirituality is no longer something that can be obtained without generous contributions; most of the spiritual reliefs available on the market have a price tag stitched around them.
Our familiar assumptions also limit our understanding of spirituality to becoming members of a spiritual sect, listening to spiritual teachers, following their instructions, and reading spiritual books regularly. But to become spiritual, one does not have to join an esoteric cult, put on religious markers, receive the spiritual energy transmission of a guru and his grace, or uncritically digest his outrageous teaching.
Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, observed that, based on our infantile experiences, it is part of human psychology to yearn for a father figure who can guide us through this chaotic, unpredictable, and confusing world. And there are different gurus, mystics, evangelists, and spiritual masters in the spiritual market ready to take up this role as father figures because, as humans, we want to live a meaningful life, find answers to the questions about our being and suffering, and overcome the fear of death. Besides, all of us also have that feeling of being unsatisfied by material comforts, things, and achievements.
As a spiritual person, I am not opposed to anyone following any spiritual teacher; however, as a follower, you must be critical enough to question their self-contradictory and baseless statements, and also, under the guise of spiritual growth, you shouldn’t be exploited, made vulnerable, or demanded to make irrational commitments and actions. We also need to realize that nobody in this world has a truth that doesn’t need to be proved. I have met hundreds of spiritual teachers from different religious traditions, but I never forgot to keep my critical mind open. After all, the word ""spiritual"" comes from a Latin word meaning ""to breathe freely."" As a result, becoming a free spirit—those who dare to challenge traditional beliefs, let go, and celebrate their liberation—is also a part of human spirituality.
As human existence is divided into mind and matter, we need abstract and soulful substances like poetry, ideas, music, art, literature, philosophy, self-inquiry, and reflections to help us find meaning and significance in our outer actions, associations, objectives, and outcomes from our inner perspectives. In other words, to live a meaningful life, we need to find something—music, art, poetry, meditation, philosophy, or writing—that allows us to explore and engage with the outside world while maintaining our inner sense of balance, detachment, calmness, maturity, and acceptance. Hence, spirituality is a search for an equilibrium point that balances our inner and outer lives.
Spirituality awakens to a living reality that is self-sufficient in itself, and nothing can be more spiritual than living in the world, where you find events, occasions, situations, relationships, explorations, and experiences that can take you out of yourself and connect you with everyone and everything around you. We can also recognize our relative insignificance in the universe when we temporarily dissolve our egos. Similarly, spirituality urges us to embrace, adjust to, and enjoy all the recklessness and paradoxes of human life. There are contractions and confusions everywhere, but these paradoxes also make life deep, dynamic, vibrant, improbable, creative, and exciting.
Surely, life is unfair and unpredictable, and as human beings, we have to deal with lots of people, events, occurrences, and outcomes that we don't like. As everything ends, every moment of life we live, touch, love, reflect on, listen to, connect with, and experience is special, specific, unrepeatable, and unparalleled. Hence, the journey of life becomes more spiritually meaningful than its presumed destinations. This is the only life we have; therefore, everything we do, discover, relate to, and create becomes significant and valuable because we will never have another opportunity to relive and restore those fleeting moments of life. After all, nothing can be more spiritual than to breathe in a world already overflowing with life, rhythm, a sense of wonder, beauty, and mystery.
With intensity, depth of engagement, thoughtfulness, and passion, everything from meditation, yoga, and dance to driving, climbing mountains, having conversations, and having a cup of tea becomes a meaning-making process that is also spiritually enriching. Human spirituality is not something separate from our everyday lives. For example, by reading Chekhov, walking around in the woods, writing poetry, teaching, gazing at the stars, playing with my daughter, and learning the guitar, I am able to engage in a meaning-making process and also feel the connectedness of my being with other beings and nature. And there are numerous other ways to celebrate our spirituality in the midst of our daily activities and practices. Hence, spirituality is not the exclusive property of people with certain levels of spiritual awakening, and we do not need their blessings to become spiritual.
More importantly, there is no need to elevate specific spiritual practices and religious rituals above any other ordinary human activities. With a little forethought, emotion engagement, love, passion, depth in involvement, and awareness in every ounce of our fleeting human existence, we can spiritualize our individual lives.

In the age of consumerism, we as individuals are forming our mindsets and behaviors based on what we have learned from different advertisements, social media contents, blog posts, expert opinions, TikTok, celebrity endorsements on Instagram, TV reality shows, the latest viral trends and contents, product positioning, celebrity lifestyles, movies, and so on.
As a result, we are influenced by the suggestions, persuasions, and symbolic meaning we have derived from these sources and develop our taste, preferences, decisions, comparisons, and lifestyle choices accordingly.
Similarly, we also learn so much about loving relationships from the narratives of love symbolized in movies and songs. Likewise, we like to read guidebooks on the art of loving to enhance our love, replicate the love lives of different social media influencers, and make love decisions based on consumer values of use and disposal. When it comes to choosing gifts for your girlfriend, you also seek expert advice and adhere to their guidelines in order to provide her with the ultimate experience of your love.
Just to give an example of this learning because of the influence of pop songs these days, for modern lovers, breakup has simply become a natural or obvious stage of the love cycle,  comparable to any other product life cycle where, after peak experiences of love, there will be decline and discontinuity.
Being in love also becomes useless when excitement begins to weaken and the boredom of repetition starts to creep in, and at that moment, you can ""shake it off,"" as Taylor Swift reminded us; indeed, if you can't make him stay, you can at least shake him off. Breakups aren't tragic, brokenhearted, or sad. Don't waste your emotions grieving over him; save your emotions for someone else you'll find again. Now you are better off being apart than together, as “The Breakup Song” lyrics from ""Ae Dil Hai Mushkil"" remind us, and breakups have become just another reason to reignite your passion, take charge of your life again, and party with friends rather than hang on and grieve over a stale relationship.
Likewise, we feel that exchanging various products developed as gifts and engaging in modern-day love rituals would prolong, strengthen, and enrich our loving relationships. Modern-day love rituals like Rose, Chocolate, and Teddy Days, candlelight dinners, Valentine's Day gift packages, and diamond rings and bracelets make so much sense in consumer culture because the products and services that are available in the market can be used to signify and express a person's quantum of love.
Love has surely become costly. With so many products and services in the consumer market that symbolize and signify different features, dimensions, depths, and expressions of love, lovers need to have sufficient purchasing power to exchange, enjoy, and experience love in all its colors, exuberance, and facets.
From restaurants, vacations, shopping, birthday celebrations, night outs, romantic dates, and weekly gifts to movie theaters, different portions of love hang everywhere, and you need to purchase them to enrich your loving relationships. Indeed, you can consume these products and services with your partner in order to enhance your experience of being in love and make it more satisfying and exciting.
Falling in love in the age of consumerism becomes so irrelevant, less exciting, dull, and meaningless if you can't buy your portion of love.
As a result, much of human love and relationship in this consumer age is nurtured by an individual's consuming capacity and purchasing power rather than genuine passion, sacrifice, a sense of togetherness, trust, support, and tolerance for each other. We have started to view people as commodities that can be exchanged, consumed, and disposed of.
Moreover, falling in love has become some kind of window shopping where we look for different categories of image, expectation, satisfaction, and anticipation in someone to fall in love with, just like we go through a catalog to find a suitable product with essential features, functions, qualities, possibilities, and consumer benefits. As with other products, if it serves our purpose, our relationship will last for years; otherwise, it will be dumped and replaced if it fails to meet our expectations.
Besides, based on our consumer mindset, we think that we can easily dump a person and find a replacement rather than engage in the difficult tasks of acceptance, accommodations, and conflict resolution. After all, a loving relationship is interchangeable from the standpoint of a consumer; thus, like any rational consumer, we are free to dispose of the other person when we are confident enough to realize that we can now possess an upgraded model than what we currently have.
In the age of consumerism, our ways of loving and being in relationships also resemble how we would interact with and react to any other consumer product available on the market. Loving someone is just a part of consumer behavior.
Just as consumers have learned to seek temporary satisfaction—something attractive that immediately makes us happy for a moment—we all have become collectors of transient moments in love. Lovers may post their pictures or reveal their intimate confessions of love to the public in a manner of showing off, but lovers always feel insecure about being disposed of, dropped, or interchanged. And like our affection for any other consumer product, after a while, love also fades away.
Loving relationships have indeed become liquid.

Patan is a historical city situated in Lalitpur District of Nepal, inhabited by the people of Newar community. A remarkable characteristic of this city is its portrayal of religious harmony between Hindus and Buddhists in every aspect of the community. Being born and raised here, I got more and more interested in the city when I started doing my graduate studies in Urban Planning, and the insights have been truly fulfilling.
Sustainable cities are the pressing need of modern times. City planners use tactics such as zoning, open space allocation, walkability, urban growth boundaries, satellite cities and many more to achieve this, but the way in which the then planners of Patan achieved this is truly worth learning.
Let me take you through Patan in the 17th century. To start with, “Astamatrika”, the eight mother goddesses, and “Dashamahavidya”, the 10 goddesses, were established to set the boundary for urban expansion. The faith in these places of worship was such that people did not go beyond the perimeter set by the goddesses. This protected the lower fertile agricultural land, while the higher ground was used for settlement. So the perimeter boundary directed the development to be compact, and thus walkable. However, though there was compactness, there were ample urban open spaces and lung spaces (green spaces). Urban open spaces named “Lachi”, “Nani”, “Bahal” & “Bahi” were preserved and each was tied with its respective religious belief system (Hinduism or Buddhism), such that no one encroached upon it (unlike our open spaces!). For lung spaces named “khyo”, different festivals and socio-cultural events were planned such that the space would be in constant care. Also, open spaces of ecological importance were tied with various rituals too. The planners then had the vision and the creative methods to protect these open spaces.

Moving further into the city, the form of residential quarters shows the importance given to communal living. The houses are clustered around an inner courtyard, giving room for private spaces inside houses, while ensuring access to a larger public space for everyone. This model with slight deviations is becoming popular with Western developers too.

Newa Chen, a 17th-century building, renovated in 2006 with help from UNESCO

In the case of zoning, it was “zoning by jaat” or “zoning by profession”. Though the concept of “jaat” led to social discrimination, in those days it was primarily used to create “homogeneous communities by occupation” to create agglomeration and economies of scale. With all this in place, when the population still exceeded a certain limit, a satellite town was established with linkages to the main town, to curb the effects of overpopulation.
So this begs the question, how was this extraordinary feat made possible? Certainly, the planners were quite creative and the tool they used was ritual mediation. The meanings given by the people to these rituals had bound the people. They put tremendous faith in rituals and religion. But now, as with every historic city, Patan is going through the process of degeneration. At times the rituals can be seen to be performed only for the sake of rituals, without paying enough attention to the deeper purpose of sustainability, which they hoped to achieve. This situation has brought forth a new set of challenges, which calls for maximum creative efforts by planners to establish newer meanings. An example could be, the lung spaces mentioned earlier being protected through socio-cultural events might be adjusted by giving access to schools for their events in culture and sports, in case the previous ties grow weaker.
History serves as a record of experiences and learning, but not as a rule book. It is up to us to learn from the experiences of the past, and come up with creative solutions to tackle the challenges of the present and future.
May the planners of the future write as highly of us as we write about the planners of the past.

In a very odd manner, every possible world tends to exist in ways that are not entirely physical. A world that could be described in words but is devoid of any space-time convergence. Our dreams, for example, don't have any physical run-down. They just appear real to the dreamer and yet leave in a wisp when they are over. The dreamer then is left with the memory of the world that never gets to come alive, the world of zero substance, and the world whose absence is the very reason that gives meaning to the world that gets to live forward.
The nonappearance of every possible version of our other realities makes it possible for this reality to emanate into the physical world that matters to us the most. This is where we find ourselves. This is the one that has its claim on us. Think about the person you didn’t marry, the child that wasn’t born to you, the winter that failed to bring the snow and the friendship that couldn’t find its morning in the dew of little things and didn’t get refreshed.
In that sense, all that didn’t happen in a life is the very life blood of what did happen in a very bizarre and asymmetrical manner. The relationship between those two worlds is just the fringe line that makes those two worlds mutually coeval. Not just the one that claims me but also the one that I am absent from. 
This is the world that I ponder about all the time. This is also where I find myself present in my absence. 
Those two roads that diverged in the woods and the one Robert Frost didn’t take, 
What happened to that road? 
Did it wither away? 
Or did it somehow become a critical part of the one that was taken? Frost’s grievance about the road not taken makes one wonder what the real loss to him was. 
The road that he didn’t take is as necessary as the one he did take. 
For if it were not for the one untaken, the taken would lose its significance. 
However, unlike Robert Frost, there are moments in life where two roads don’t always diverge into the yellow wood. In fact, I only see one road ahead of me. And this one doesn’t lead to the yellow wood. Instead, it leads to this huge strip of a green hill. In the midst of that hill, there’s a big oak tree. Under it, I see a man waiting for something, or perhaps someone. I don’t know.
So, I hesitate for a moment, but then I move toward him to get closer.
The story of his life is the story of anyone’s life. He has had his share of life’s ups and downs in this world that claims him in all its hue and tinge. The man’s loss of his love, his aspirations, his honor, his will, and all that makes him the hero of his device, all that is taken away. 
This is the man who doesn’t look straight at me. I cannot clearly see him.
His voice grooved and barely audible, as if he is telling the story of his life to himself. My presence doesn't seem to bother him. He is speaking very softly, and he is speaking of the life he missed to be a part of. This life, the one under the oak, isn’t his for him. He is a stranger here.
The life, he thinks, belongs to him is in the negative space. It is the space that can only be imagined or dreamed of. This is where he finds his completions. 
His love, his honor, his aspirations, and everything that makes him a whole, it happens in this imagined space.
This is his home, the one built on his absences.
Nonetheless, he seems not to understand that both these worlds, the one under the oak tree and the one away from it are his to claim.
One subdued in the background while the other bulged out into physical space. 
Both these two realms are necessary for this forlorn man to become a whole.
Take away one and the other ceases to live. 
I look at him again, and this time, he looks right back at me.
The man slowly moves as if to talk to me. He leans forward.
Now, I see his face in my deepest awe. I know this man! 
This is the man from that hill. The man from under the oak tree.
I recognize him now. This man is me. 
I am the man under that oak tree.

I can understand when philosopher Slavoj Zizek sees happiness as unethical. For many of us happiness seekers, his assertion may sound rather surprising. However, I think Zizek is right with his claim, if our appetite for maximizing our happiness now impacts ecological collapse, puts the existence of future generations on this planet at a greater risk and also compromises the ability of the future generations to meet their needs without strife and needless sufferings. Besides, in an age of hyperconsumerism, we have placed our habits of happiness on a shallow myth that we can’t be happy without having. And, we have mindlessly decided to overlook the bitter truth that many of our happiness choices are detrimental to the ecology and sustainability. Similarly, our search for happiness can be unethical if we stifle and undermine the happiness of others for our selfish fulfillments. We see this in our family life, where most parents add needless sorrows in the lives of their children for not keeping up with their choices, expectations and preferences.
My own search for happiness reminds me that the road I am traveling on is full of potholes. And, by traveling on this bumpy road, I have realized that happiness always appears in our life in unusual shapes, sounds and sizes. Hence, there are little puddles of humor, fun, playfulness and joys everywhere. Moreover, in my search for happiness, I have unearthed some essential ingredients for a happy life.
To live a happy life, firstly, we need to respect and admire others for their unique ways of being in the world. Some like to make noise, others crave silence, and some like to be in front and others like to shout from the back. Hence, rather than comparing people, we need to admire people for who they are, what they have been through and how they like to engage with other people. With this respect we can both increase and improve our human relationships, the way we relate to each other, which is essential for a happy life.
The next ingredient for a happy life is that we need to have enough courage so that we can avoid becoming a chasing shadow of other people’s expectations, projections and desires. Without courage, our life would be nothing more than a tedious circle of compulsions and compromises. And, it also takes enormous courage to be satisfied with who we are and what we have right now.
Finally, so much of our happiness depends on our ability to let go of our sense of control. In a world of imperfections, how our life unfolds and how people decide to act and react with us are beyond our absolute control. Hence, rather than holding onto the ropes of our expectations tightly, we need to let go and enjoy what remains of it, the experience of life, with all its random surprises - and that’s what happiness is.
Sources of Happiness
The most important source of happiness in our life is not what we have with us or what we want to have sooner or later, rather, streams of happiness begin to sprout in our life abundantly when we begin to realize that our human life is indeed little and we can’t go on postponing our happiness by attaching it to some event, situation or to an achievement that we may never encounter in our short life. None of us have a written script of our life with us and as we strive toward our dreams and possibilities, often the drama of life turns out the way we never suspected.
And, to find happiness in those messy and confusing moments of our life we need to recognize that patterns of human life are unwritten, uncalled for and unpredictable. Even with our utmost preparedness none of us can systematically dictate the course of our life with our own will. Therefore, in order to live a happy life we need to replace the concept of happiness as a destination with the concept of happiness as a process. After all, so much of the happiness we experience in our life depends on how we react to what is happening in and around us.
Most of us are unhappy because we think of happiness in terms of when or how we are going to be happy. Whereas we can create happiness even in difficult situations of our life by remaining resolute in our inner conviction that with whatever we have we can always recreate our life once again. Besides, when we have nothing else to do, even counting what we already have also makes us happy. Despite having many things, many of us are miserable with a single thought of why we don’t have with us what the rest of the world already has.
Having is not enough; happiness happens when we do something that makes us feel worthwhile, energetic, focused, connected, purposeful and engaged. For example, we can learn new stuff, develop new habits, cultivate new friends, make life easy for ourselves, let go of expectations that pull us down and sometimes take a step back to see things anew. Moreover, life is not fair and all of us don’t need equal things to be equally happy. Our struggles also give us a sense of happiness when we realize that we are maturing as a human being climbing new heights.
Finally, I feel that the most precious source of happiness is always cheap, ordinary, plentiful, spontaneous and free. Just the other day, I was witnessing clouds in the sky, which seemed like building tiny steps into eternity, and these clouds floating in the sky made me feel relaxed and fulfilled for a while. I know there is nothing special about clouds playing in the sky. However, all we get in life are the moments to become happy and it depends on how we add these moments  to our experiences and make our life a satisfying journey.
Happiness: A Journey
Whenever I ponder over my quest for a flourishing life, I take the words of poet T.S. Elliot rather seriously as he has written somewhere in one of his poems that, we shall not cease from exploration/and the end of all our exploring/we will arrive where we started and know the place for the first time. In essence, our search for happiness begins with oneself and culminates within oneself. However, in a world of constant distractions, denials, self-deceptions and delusions, for most of us it is rather discomforting to be at ease, comfort or at peace with oneself.
After witnessing and experiencing various ups and downs in our life and facing up to all the troubles and sorrows that life throws at us from time to time, our search for happiness turns full circle when we realize that the ultimate joy in our life begins to overflow profoundly when we become true to ourselves standing before the mirror of our life, embracing its true reflections and finding freedom within our self. But, the paradox here is that only those who know how to spread out their self find happiness within them. Hence, in our search for happiness we also realize that happiness is not something we experience in isolation and that we derive most of our happiness by connecting with people around us.
Moreover, the journey of life takes its own turn and we also need to adopt, adjust and add a sense of growth and maturity with our age as various phases of our life have their own peculiar sources of joy for us to rediscover. Here, for many people their search for happiness becomes delusional, self-destructive and indulgent, when they fail to comprehend this reality of human life. Hence, to experience happiness at different junctures, we need to rephrase and reshape our dreams, hopes, wishes, relationships and expectations, adopting the emerging realities of our life. Besides, as long as we are pursuing happiness, our search becomes like running about from one circle to another trying to find something that exists like a mirage appearing in the dry wilderness; it appears at once and escapes in another moment. And, while journeying on rough and tough roads of our life in search of happiness, often we need to take a pause and shift our mind from the loops of desiring and expecting to life itself where everything is alive and happening.
Lastly, rather than finding, happiness is just about letting go and losing oneself in the moment with whatever ordinary we have, a piece of music, art, dance, reflection, love, friendship, conversation, meditation , sex, fun or poetry. After all, happiness is always with us, it simply needs a bit of inner tuning and with our sense of ease, acceptance and comfort within oneself, we can catch its vibrations all around us echoing.

Rabindra Mishra’s new alliance with the Rashtriya Prajatantra Party, virtually a political arm of the former king, has hogged much of the limelight in recent days. The comfort with which he has gelled with his new companions indicates that Mishra is much more at ease under the former king’s patronage than he ever was during his brief, if half-hearted, stint as a republican with the Bibeksheel Sajha Party. The palpable ease with which he has hugged the institution of monarchy shows that he has finally sloughed off his outer skin and has decided to openly and unequivocally put the money where his mouth is. In deciding to abandon his previous niceties–both in his ideology as well as his speech–Mishra has replaced his finger wagging schoolmarmish style, with a metaphorical sledge-hammer and has decided to wield it against the nascent democracy questioning its very foundations.
It is no wonder that Mishra has tapped into a powerful mix of grievances and resentment of the old guard, those who typically were the beneficiaries of–and did well under–the former king’s and his predecessor’s patronage. If the “likes” and “retweets” on Twitter are any indication, even those who claim to be a “Global Citizen from Gulmi” seem to be tacitly endorsing a patently parochial view based on medieval superstitions.
That a child born in a certain family inherently holds a superior position to the rest of us and accordingly has an in-born right to rule as an “enlightened guardian”–something that Mishra is advocating for–is a notion that would invoke laughter and ridicule if it was not so dangerous and foolish.
Now, to his credit, I think Mishra is indirectly and unwittingly serving democracy by holding the banner of opposition against, among other things, the cronyism and kleptocracy of our current leaders. The current crop of leaders are indeed undermining Nepal’s fledgling democracy by their own incompetence and widespread grift. Our democratic institutions, unfortunately, have not matured enough to curb the excesses of our leaders and a sensible conservatism, I believe, does have an important role to play in the current political climate.
However, by advocating for the resurrection of a dated institution that has been the provenance of bigotry, arbitrary hierarchy, and authoritarian policies in the past, Mishra is doing nothing more than expressing his frustration against the radical leveling of human dignity that has followed the Maoist Revolution in Nepal.
For all its chaos and cravenness, there is no denying that the Maoist revolution initiated an era of modernity that valued the minorities and indigenous people as human beings with their own individuality and human dignity, something that was denied to them for centuries under the structural discriminations created and sustained under various monarchical regimes.
Mishra’s belief that a “soft dictator” should always hover over the heads of Nepali people–ready to unleash the punitive power of the state at its will–not only belies ignorance of human psychology and its cravings for unlimited power, but, more importantly, is indicative of a limited historical understanding of how democracy functions and delivers.
Democracy, though a rule of the majority, ensures fundamental freedoms and protects the rights of the minorities. It is an inherently messy system which by default favors wheeling and dealing among various political actors instead of dealing in quick fixes along clean and defined lines. Unfortunately the bad tags along with the good in a democracy, and it is one of the vital duties of a politician to see that the good comes out on top. However, men are not angels and therefore democracy requires institutional maturity and independence to hold the political actors accountable whenever they cross the legal and normative boundaries. And those boundaries are set not only by courts and government agencies but also by the society at large. An intelligent politician more attuned to the aspirations of modern times would try to align our Byzantine institutions–the actual root of our current problem–with the promises enshrined in our current Constitution, however lacking those may be. It is no doubt easier said than done; however, a great leader knows that not everything can be achieved in one’s lifetime. A good leader knows that our present should not define our future because politics at heart is about what ought to be rather than what is.
Instead Mishra has decided to provoke the latent elements in our society that are atavistic, backward, and superstitious. By surrendering his conscience at the altar of His Highness, Mishra, I believe, is doing a disservice to the ideology of conservatism itself. In his interviews he regularly waxes nostalgic about what we have lost as a culture and community, but rarely does he acknowledge what we have gained as a nation. The laundry list of his complaints are long and consist mainly of the natural consequences that result when a society long held on a chokehold of arbitrary power breaks free. The Nepali people have freed themselves from an arbitrary power that could snatch our freedom at will. We have laid the groundwork for a positive, scientific, and a forward looking country where the minorities and the indigenous have an equal ownership in the nation. It would be a significant backward step to take that away from the people and hand it over to a hereditary power that could potentially pull the plug on our democracy on its whim. Are we really up for that?

What does the future of humanity look like? Machine learning and artificial intelligence are pushing all kinds of business, innovation, research and other areas to a whole new level, especially in developed countries. The time has come for Nepal to embrace the power of machine learning and artificial intelligence to tackle the difficult problems that the country has faced for centuries. Natural disasters, precision agriculture, managing road traffic, environmental sustainability are the perfect candidates for the next technological revolutions.
As a middle school student in America, I have had the privilege of learning programming and machine learning along with theoretical foundations from experts in the field. I invite the girls of Nepal to join me in learning the foundations of data science and machine learning so that we not only help the country to grow with a future army of machine learning experts, but also smooth out the wrinkles of the gender gap in Nepal. It is obvious that one of the most significant steps toward breaking the gender barrier is through empowering girls. Let's make it happen!
Your future is powered by code; if you want to build for the future, you'll need to learn how to code. Here, I propose an innovative idea about the most sophisticated tool that is transforming the world right now. I invite the girls of Nepal to join me in learning how to code for predictive analytics and machine learning. My purpose for this call is twofold: first, to contribute to reducing the gender gap, and second, to have fun teaching coding and machine learning.
Coding, or computer programming, is a vital tool in science, engineering, business and many other fields that will help you tremendously in achieving your goals. Coding is the language of machine learning and predictive analytics. The developed countries of the world are undergoing a major transformation in their economies thanks to the very powerful algorithms of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). But how does it work?
Machine learning is a futuristic idea that has been in the making for quite some time now. It is a set of algorithms that predicts patterns and data on a large scale. Machines are learning how to process vast amounts of data in order to improve our lives in ways we can't even fathom. Machine learning is a set of computer algorithms that learn how to make predictions based on the information provided. With human intelligence, it is difficult to make predictions with datasets that are too large, complex, or vast. In contrast, machines will be able to take the data and make the predictions that humans cannot.
Take an example of AlphaGo with which began the global sensation of AI. Designed in 2015, AlphaGo, an AI with unimaginable power, won against the best of the best in the game of Go. The best part is, the designer of AlphaGo has no clue how to play the game.
Whereas AlphaGo is an example of a full-blown powerful AI, what I am proposing here is the route to becoming a specialist in various types of predictive analytics and machine learning. Conventionally, AI has been treated as a broad spectrum of techniques that solve a computational task. This can theoretically include many techniques, many of them being not-so-great historically. Machine learning is a suite of powerful statistical models and algorithms that have developed dramatically in these last few decades. These days, when the media talks about AI, they usually refer to a specific version of the ML models called deep learning or its variants.
Machine learning is a remarkable set of technologies that can be used for a wide variety of applications. One of the algorithms I’ve written is 97% accurate in detecting breast cancer. For this, I used a database of over 11,000 medical records published online. The model I wrote learns to distinguish a case of breast cancer from a healthy breast by comparing many characteristics of breasts afflicted with cancer versus the ones without. Machine learning is the foundation of the future of healthcare. Experts believe that half of the medical discoveries and innovations will come from machine learning in a decade, as opposed to the current heavy reliance on hard-core scientific research as of now.
Machine learning algorithms are used for many kinds of applications such as in healthcare, email filtering, speech recognition, computer vision, search engine queries, and many more. The question is, can we create an army of ML experts in Nepal and make a dent in the gender gap with the proper training and mindset?
Machine learning, specifically AI driven by the architecture of deep learning model, is transforming the industries of the developed world. Whereas all these achievements sound far-fetched, especially in a developing country like Nepal, they were all achieved with the application of powerful algorithms. For that, all you need is a passion to learn how to code and to learn the theory. I am myself learning machine learning, and have already been able to use some of the machine learning models I have programmed in various predictions. It gives me pleasure when I can teach what I have learnt and help reduce the gender gap at the same time. If you are curious about coding, data engineering and machine learning, join me online in gaining this new knowledge.
In this programming and machine learning course, I will walk you through the basics of programming. This foundational material about scripting is the first step in programming of any type of analytics. And this is going to enrich you with a whole new suite of scripts to perform many essential tasks in analytics. The skills in foundational programming will also come handy when you want to solve many kinds of real-world problems. For example, I like to program and solve problems that come up in college-level probability courses. I am able to do this via programming even when I don’t understand the math.
I have created a few articles showing several of these problems, their code, and solutions. For example, roll several dice at the same time and if you observe the same number in more than one dice repeatedly, those outcomes can be simulated with the code I published here. In another article here, I show how the chances of two students in a group of 25 having the birthday on the same day are actually pretty high. I have also published my code here to find the probabilities of various kinds of card games. In addition, I simulated the famed Monty Hall Problem to solve the puzzling question as to which choice would help you win the game. The simulation of the situation [available at my GitHub] revealed that the answer was not what I had thought.
Whereas you can do many types of problem-solving with the basics of programming like I showed above, the main goal of this first course is to get ready for machine learning. Once the basics of programming are completed, I will walk you through several models of machine learning. If you are interested, sign up today for this free course. All you need is a computer, and the desire to learn!

I come from the Chepang community, one of the most backward communities in Nepal and categorized as a highly marginalized community by the National Federation for Development of Indigenous Nationalities (NFDIN). As I belong to and grew up in this community, it motivated me to write a reflective piece on the contributions of education and the bottlenecks for the Chepang community in the current educational pedagogy in Nepal.
The Chepang community falls behind in different socioeconomic indicators such as literacy and access to health and basic infrastructure, as well as in different socioeconomic categorizations. Despite support from several NGOs, INGOs and constant support from the government, the Chepang community continues to remain in a dire situation. There were several non-formal education programs conducted by NGOs which have enabled target groups to become aware so that they can help themselves. Despite the continuous flow of aid, however, the desired socio-economic transformation has not been seen in the Chepang community. This gives ample supporting statement on why there has been less development in the Chepang community. Literacy rate is still low, most of them still live below the poverty line, and they are far behind in the human development index and similar indicators. There are indigenous communities who made a leap in income-generating activities, adult literacy programs, and other development activities. Chepang people, however, still lag behind on all fronts.
Every year thousands of students complete SEE, higher secondary education or bachelor’s degree out of whom few are from the Chepang community. Despite structural and historical disadvantages, a few Chepangs excel in their academic career. Even after Chepangs are able to complete their education in spite of several hardships, they need to compete with others for Public Service Commission, non-governmental, skills-based and other jobs. Those who are able to receive good schooling are at least exposed to multiple facilities including access to computer learning, libraries and sports, and so might have enriched their general knowledge and have a competitive advantage when applying for jobs. But the ones like students from the Chepang community who mostly complete school from a place where there are limited facilities, exposure and training, find it difficult to compete with the batch of students with whom they pass SEE or high school together. Lack of basic computer skills, training and exposure puts them at a disadvantage in the application process. However, there are a few exceptions where a student who completed schooling from a remote part of the country competed and excelled in many aspects. This gives ample space to reflect on what is holding the Chepang community back – whether it is the current pedagogy or the incompetency within students from the Chepang community.

Education as a means to reproduce inequality for Chepang community
It is clearly seen in Nepal that those who can afford expensive tuition fees, mostly those from economically well-off backgrounds, tend to send their children to private schools, colleges and universities because they think that expensive schools provide quality education.
When selecting schools and colleges for their children, parents with fat wallets in Nepal take into account the infrastructure of the institution, well-decorated classrooms, transportation, computer labs, swimming pools, basketball courts, football grounds and other facilities. These parents believe that quality education is provided by such schools with proper infrastructure and other facilities. Although it might be a subjective measurement for quality education as indicators, this will make a substantial impact on what students will learn in what environment. Though these may not be good indicators for measurement, what students will learn and how they will learn will certainly make an impact on the overall learning process. And yes, it is certain that students from better economic backgrounds can afford private tutors and attend private schools. Several studies have also found out the positive relations between students’ economic backgrounds and their test scores. These components contribute to differential academic performance in schools which is directly related to the income of a student’s family.
The Chepangs, most of whom come from a poor and downtrodden socioeconomic background, cannot generally attend expensive schools unless they are provided scholarships, subsidies and other benefits. So, students from affluent families go to well-off schools while those from poor economic background attend economic schools. These are the initial indicators for students leading to learning disparities that reinforce social inequality. These substantiate that schools provide competitive learning environments to advantaged children compared to disadvantaged children where schools reproduce or exacerbate some inequalities.
To illustrate with a real-life example, I asked my sister Simran Praja (name changed) who is waiting for her grade 12 results. She is not familiar with what a CV or resume is. She also does not have computer knowledge and skills which are a prerequisite in today’s job market. Basic email communication, searching for jobs, applying for jobs and getting shortlisted is a tall order. There are only a handful of Chepang representatives in government services. Hence, preparing for Public Service Commission jobs is also a difficult task although it’s not impossible.
Hence, these real-life examples clearly show the challenges faced by Chepang students even after they manage to complete basic schooling, high school and even university education. The quality of education that Chepang students are getting is leading them nowhere. A research on Chepangs in 2011 found out that Chepangs had more access to education than before, but the quality of education that Chepang students were receiving was below average. Though a growing number of students were enrolled in schools, children were now just going through the rituals of schooling rather than learning and preparing for their secure future.

Educational journey stymies Chepang’s development
Reflecting on my personal experience of growing up in a Chepang community where there is material deprivation, lack of fulfillment of basic needs and other necessities further deprives the Chepang students of a learning environment. Several studies claim that material deprivation also leads to low educational achievement in schools as students coming from low economic strata tend to lack education materials, environment and parental guidance throughout. To illustrate with an example, poverty plays a crucial role in Chepang children dropping out of school. Some may not be able to afford an education while some drop out in the middle due to household responsibilities. To support the claim one study states that cultural factors play a significant role in Chepang girls dropping out of school as Chepang people expect girls to help their families with household chores, leaving many girls at home during the harvest season and festivals when their families need their help. The author claims that many girls do not attend classes on a regular basis because of household duties such as cutting grass for animals, cooking food, cleaning and taking care of younger siblings.
Even during the recent COVID crisis in Nepal, several students from poor economic backgrounds could not afford to purchase phones and internet data packs which hampered their class attendance. As a result, they could not attend online classes in schools, ultimately leading to many school dropouts in the last two years. Most of the school-going children from the Chepang community had to discontinue their education during the pandemic for lack of internet access, technology and devices, resulting in a large number of dropouts.
These reflections and arguments are also backed up by contributions in sociology by scholars such as Luis Althusur, Downey and Condron who claim that education acts as a means for reproduction of ruling class ideology where dominant class ideology is taught. The scholarly claims that schools act as engines of inequality dominate contemporary sociology of education even though schools play little role in generating achievement gaps. These educational institutions act as a social sorting machine, creating categories that serve as the foundation of later life inequalities. These categories contribute to production of inequalities within schools and beyond.
Way forward for Chepangs: Technical education as a ray of hope
Development agencies still tend to impose their own agenda rather than fulfilling the requirements of Chepangs. Some of the common instances are awareness activities such as financial frugality, use of contraceptives, use of pit latrine, growing cash crops, forming mothers groups, training on tailoring, youth clubs, and ability to sign one’s name. Where is the indigenous knowledge and the prior knowledge that the Chepang community possesses? Why did income-based learning not become a priority for this vulnerable and poor community? Technical and vocational education is gradually gaining popularity in the Chepang community. Technical certified jobs like staff nurse, overseer, electrician, plumber, health assistant are now becoming a way forward for the Chepang community. There are growing numbers of staff nurses who are already in local level health posts on government contracts. These small steps also play a key role in helping the Chepang community support their families, siblings in accessing education and other opportunities.
As most of the Chepang people are below the poverty line, the government needs to give priority to creating more employment opportunities so that everyone can get work. Given that a majority of youths from the community are less educated and have dropped out halfway through school, the country needs to train and mobilize them in the development process. Productivity-focused training skills, recognizing prior learning of Chepangs should be imparted with inclusive targeting to the Chepang community which can provide access to work. This entire process not only helps the country’s economy to grow but also enables the Chepang youths to earn their livelihoods.

As I sit by my ailing father, I have an impression of him representing an era of slowly vanishing Limbu culture and tradition of Mundhum-based rites and rituals.
I still vividly remember how vehemently he performed the ritual of Tongsing Takma as a Yeba (Limbu shaman assigned for carrying out various rituals) some decades ago. In the night of the ritual performance, he would wear long white robe tightened at the waist, a headdress decorated with the feathers of different birds and garlands made from the beads of rudraksha. For the whole night, he would recite Mundhum and dance around the bamboo pole known as Yagesing fixed for the ritual in the middle of the courtyard. As a boy, I could hardly grasp the eloquence of his Mundhum recitation and message of those rich oral scriptures. For me, the event was simply an occasion of celebration and fun where I enjoyed ludicrously following and copying his dancing steps and panicked and thrilled being chased by him in the middle of the ritual performance along with others.
Back then, Limbu community operated differently. They observed their own distinct life rituals including Tongsing Takma. The night of Tongsing Takma was not only an event for ritual performance but it was also a social gathering for the entire villagers. Some of them would come to join hands for the different responsibilities including feeding Tongba (millet beer served in a wooden barrel shaped vessel) and other local liquor to the visitors while others would come to know their fortune from the words of the Yeba, my father. Others joined the Yeba and his Yagapsiba (assistant of the Yeba) in the ritual dance carrying and beating brass plates. For majority of villagers, it was a pure form of an entertainment free of invitation. Everyone was welcomed in the night of the Tongsing Takma ritual.
The decade of 1990 ushered prodigious changes in Nepali politics as well as in sociocultural realms. The Janaandolan of 1990 saw an end of absolute monarchy replaced by constitutional monarchy and multiparty system ending three decades of party-less Panchayat system imposed by King Mahendra in 1960. The same decade also worked as a harbinger for the country embracing neoliberal ideals as the panacea for socio-economical transformation. Nobody thought of far-reaching implications of the incipient systems to the local language, culture, knowledge system and social structures of the indigenous people.
Same applied to the Limbu people, chiefly inhabiting the eastern part of Nepal.  In addition to joining British and Indian armies as Lahure, many Limbu youths followed the footsteps of other Nepali migrant workers making destinations mainly to Malaysia and the Gulf Cooperative Council countries including Qatar, Saudi Arabia, UAE and Kuwait among others. As foreign employment became a major source of income for many a Nepali households in the last three decades, it further provided an impetus for people to migrate from the hills and mountains to the plain regions of Tarai and from rural villages to city and towns, thus bringing unprecedented changes in rubrics of society and culture.
Such migration trends not only resulted in the shortage of working age people in the villages but also brought changes in demographic and economic structures of towns and countryside leaving the family members of migrant workers increasingly dependent on the remittance they send from abroad. Accordingly, people fell under the charm of consumerism ultimately debilitating the bonds of social relationship and cultural convictions of the indigenous people. As everybody seemed lost in the reservoirs of containment by hailing the contribution of Nepali migrant workers to the economic development of Nepal, nobody seemed cognizant of the disconcerting side of the coin, the breakdown in the family structures and cultural mosaics. The void was not only created in the local labor markets, but also in the urgency of indigenous cultural behaviors and ritual practices.
In the past, my father used to remain busy throughout the year serving the village households as Yeba, performing different rituals of Limbu community like Sappok Chomen (ritual for womb worshipping prior to birth), Mangenna (ritual for good health, peace and progress), Mekkhim (ritual for marriage ceremony) etc. Due to his engagement in such activities of the community, I sometimes used to hear him complaining about not having time for his own household chores as a farmer. But he readily served the community on such occasions. I still remember how my father used to take pride in his narratives of being kidnapped by a supernatural wild shaman in his childhood who taught him the sacred knowledge of Mundhum and turned himself a self learnt Yeba, as one of the chosen persons by the God to save Limbu community from the various misfortunes and sickness. Gradually, my father and fellow Limbu shamans commonly called as Phedangma, Samba, Yeba and Yuma not only found their roles being drastically limited within the community, but they also failed to pass their knowledge to the next generation.
Hermeneutics of Tongsing Mundhum
According to Mundhum scholar Bairagi Kaila, Tongsing Mundhum is an extreme expression of social, ethical and religious beliefs of Limbu people. He writes in Tongsing Takma Mundhum: Aakhyan Ra Anusthan (Tongsing Takma Mundhum: Narratives and Rituals) that Tongsing Mundhum is a quintessential collection of oral literature and ethnic narratives that have been transferred orally from the time immemorial to the Limbu people. This Mundhum is recited and narrated along with music of brass plates and drums by Limbu shamans known as Samba, Yeba, and Yema during the performances of Tongsing Takma ritual. It is believed that Tongsing Mundhum was originated long before the art of writing was introduced.
According to scholar Chaintanya Subba, various myths, legends, narratives and oracles have been incorporated in Tongsing Mundhum which guide the social, ethical and religious concepts and shape the attitude and behavior of the Limbus. It consists of the various myths related to the origin of universe, human beings, plants and animals, and birth of the concepts of incest, jealousy, curse etc. in human society and the remedies for different problems in the society.
Limbus believe that there have been substantial influences of the Tongsing Mundhum in the customs, ideologies, moral values and life rituals of the Limbu community. It has a distinct pragmatic and instructional value with regards to the construction and continuation of various social practices and belief system in the Limbu community. It has played a crucial role in imparting the message of social solidarity and cooperation. However, there remains an effectual task for us to explore the social dimensions of Tongsing Takma ritual impacting the social life and practices of Limbus in the past.
Modernization has resulted into an irreversible loss of Limbu cultural heritages and ritual practices. A handful of enthusiasts of Limbu community are in disagreement themselves on which terminology best describes Limbu religion and cultural landscapes. Each group claims its own validity over the other but ironically overlooks the urgency of passing the knowledge to the coming generation. They don’t realize that culture and rituals live in society, not in institutions and books. If such cultural values can not be transferred to the coming generation, they would be the matter of history, to be searched in anthologies and museums. We certainly do not want that. So, rather than castigating others, we need to explore the nostrums to address the present challenges.
As the majority of young generation are detached from such ritual practices, an irreparable cultural void is being created every day. Incipient danger is that present generation could be the last generation of Limbu community practicing and living with the distinct cultural practices and Mundhum-based life rituals. As remaining Phedangma, Samba, Yeba and Yuma have failed to transfer their knowledge to the young generation, it would be very hard to find their disciples practicing these rituals through the oral recitation of Mundhum after one or two decades. Don’t get me wrong. I don’t want this to happen either. But I have not seen any other possibility too until we carry the torch of responsibility to stand as bulwarks to protect and preserve our distinctive cultural traits before they are pushed into oblivion by the varieties of intrusions.
Today, Tongsing Takma and other rituals have become rare events in Limbu community due to two main reasons: first, very few Limbu Phedangma, Samba, Yeba, and Yema are left in the community who can perform them in a proper way and second, young generation have no inclination to follow these rituals as they are gradually losing interest in the past ideals. This is not simply the fault of young generation living under the overwhelming fluctuations of information and technology. We must take responsibility for not infusing them cultural consciousness and not persuading them to adopt these value systems in everyday life.
Nowadays, a very few households are conducting Tongsing Takma and other rituals as a part of their daily lives mostly in remote villages. Some enthusiastic individuals and institutions are conducting this ritual in Kathmandu and other towns too. But such events largely become a simulacrum of the real Tongsing Takma, more as a frail attempt to recreate it and less as a distinct life rituals of the Limbu community. Such formalized occasions cannot persuade the heuristic value of these rituals to the coming generations.
The only positive sign in this area is there have been some works in the transcribing the oral scriptures of Mundhum recited by those Limbu shamans. In recent days, some Limbu scholars and writers have transcribed Mundhum in Limbu and Nepali language and have documented those ritual performances. In this direction, the colossus work of Mundhum expert Bairagi Kaila is always commendable. He has collected and transcribed most of the Mundhum with the help of Limbu Phedangma, Samba, Yeba, and Yema. I personally feel indebted to his huge contribution to the Limbu community by preserving Limbu Mundhum.
Years ago, in the night of the Tongsing Takma ritual, my father used to recite Mundhum and its myths in a rhythmic tone from his infallible memory followed by rhythmic beating of his brass plate and harmonious shamanic dancing steps. In the morning, he would perform the ritual of Silam Sakma (blocking the path of death) for the whole family concerned by reciting the Mundhum as:
A bright place due to the moon above us
A bright place due to the sun above us
In the place of life and age 
Are life and age decreasing?
Are the bells of time and death ringing?
Now, without letting the death bell ring
I toss this incanted coin 
To block the path of the death.
(Excerpts translated from the Tongsing Takma Mundhum: Aakhyan Ra Anusthan by Bairagi Kaila)
With these words, he would toss the coin in the name of each family member until the intended side of the coin overturned in the ground. The turning of the expected side of the coin is believed to have blocked the path of death, as a part of the ritual. I do not claim the efficacy of this ritual in the real time, but the psychological and mental asset of such rituals were certainly an important part of the community in past.
Once ardent practitioner of Mundhum based rituals, my father would spend hours discussing about Mundhum and its various myths deciphering their meaning and implications to us. He adored Mundhum as a treasure for Limbu community that teaches us to live in harmony with nature. He used to say all natural entities be it rivers, hills, caves, forests, or anything that we get from nature, have to be worshiped and preserved because they support human life in one way or the other. He was not being philosophical at that time, neither had he had any idea of the subject but he was simply passing his impression of Mundhum for our generation. Today, I feel that humankind have already deferred the deadline to respect the nature, by exploiting its resources to the fullest extent and wreaking an unprecedented havoc in its beauty. And obviously, we are getting paid by the effects of global warming and other disastrous natural phenomena for our irresponsible action towards nature threatening the existence of life in the blue planet.
Even though we listened to his stories enthusiastically, my father could figure out that his listeners were losing interests in them. Then his remarks would be same as always - time has changed…in our time………and so on. At this moment, I can sense the meaning of his words but the time has changed for me too. But what I fear most is I even may not have the same words to convey to my children by referring to the nostalgia of our time. The indispensable cultural values that ​​we have inherited from our ancestors have been eroding with the passage of time. We are living in an age of cultural deviation and oblivion. Now, when I sit by my ailing father living in his early eighties, I sometimes envisage him as Truganini (1812 –1876) the last full blood Aboriginal Tasmanian, whose culture and identity were completely swept away by the wave of 19th century colonialism.

The Summer of 2005 was my first birthday and no guests visited. There was a cake and a toy.
The toy was a helicopter with a broken wing that didn’t turn-on or chuff. I always wondered why it was like that.
Also, to bear in mind, my parents emigrated from Nepal when I was seven months old. I was too small, too chubby, and too witless to contribute to their struggle except for the grins and the giggles that made it easier for them to move on with their days.
Not until sophomore year in high school did I learn how much my parents had struggled during the early years in the US. I also found the helicopter didn’t run, only because my parents couldn’t afford a toy during that time. So, they rummaged that broken chopper from someone else’s trash.
Nonetheless, my intent in this narrative is not to inspire any sympathy. For me, this story is not as somber as it sounds. In fact, I got an opportunity to understand my parents’ struggle with a newfound humility. Their story and their sacrifice helped me get through a struggle, even if minor, was all my own.
Somewhere around the same time I was in high school, and nothing was going well. More importantly, I could not seem to get faster running cross-country. I had always loved running since early on, but at that point, the sport felt more like an obligation than a passion. I strove for motivation but failed to find one. At the heart of this disquietude, I knew the slip-up was only because without a clear plan, I just was not driven.
As fate would have it, one morning in September of 2019, while I was struggling to run at the practice, Jaclyn, one of my faster running mates, asked me to run with her. I refused at first because I knew I couldn't keep up with her and yet, for some reason, I decided to plug away. That day, I called out on whatever was holding me back and I ran with her. I ran for myself and for my parents, and I ran to be the best version of my possibility.
This gave me confidence and made me realize that I could accomplish what I thought was unimaginable. I realized my doubts and insecurities stemmed from my failure to push myself outside my comfort zone and that merely wanting something is not enough. I also had to act on it!
After that day, I proactively began creating a routine that I consistently followed. Just in a few weeks, I started seeing improvements.
Aside from the track, I also got in touch with a few friends from Nepal and created a think tank named ‘The Connectors.’ The goal of this group was to support Nepal’s diplomacy with the other countries, especially its neighbors like India, China, and Bangladesh.
I became one of the senior captains in the Colleyville Heritage High School Cross-Country team. We qualified for the state three years consecutively and our team finished fourth among 5A Schools in Texas during the 2021 season. Meanwhile, I also frequently volunteer by visiting the middle school runners to motivate and encourage them.
I often think about that moment in my sophomore year where something snapped into the place, and I began to turn my life around. Some part of me believes that moment is defined by my friend’s lending hand while the other part is the inspiration from my parents' adversities.
Nietzsche once said, 'A person with a Why can bear any How or What.'
That forlorn summer morning, that dwindling moment of despair and gratitude, when those hapless hands picked that toy, that’s where I found my ‘Why’.
The lowest moment my dad and my mom endured to give me a wisp of joy is now my highest moment to give them theirs back.

For a very long time we have been hearing the government’s intention to regulate the over the top (OTT) and other services providing internet content in Nepal. Well, the wait is over as the government has recently come up with the amendment in the National Broadcasting Regulation 1995 (2052).
The 11th amendment of the regulation has included OTT, video on demand (VOD), and internet television under 'Other Means of Communications'. With the said inclusion, the regulation now requires OTT and internet television to register to provide its service in Nepal. The term OTT has been defined as the service of displaying the programs as per the demand of the consumer through the internet without using the means of direct to home (DTH) cable or satellite and such term shall also include the media streaming services through other platforms by the means of internet. Further, internet television (Internet TV) has included the regular act of transmission of the self-produced audio-visual programs through the internet.
This definition will require popular streaming service providers like YouTube, Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc. to obtain approval from the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology. The regulation has further provisioned for the mandatory requirement of the cache server within Nepal if the OTT service provider intends to make any member or customer in Nepal or acquire any kind of fees from Nepal. It has also required the storage of user information within the server of Nepal. Further, the OTT service providers should keep a record of the programs transmitted by them, for at least 60 days and the same shall also be made accessible to the ministry and other governmental authorities in the process of investigations.
The content to be displayed through OTT must also be subject to categorization as per age. The “U” rating must be granted for such content which is appropriate to all the age groups whereas “A” rating is provided to the content for the age group above 18 years. “R” rating, similarly, provided to the content appropriate to the age group of 10-18 years.
The regulation also provisions that the ministry can take control of such equipment or make necessary arrangements to disallow the operation of such equipment which has been used for transmission or communication of the program in an unauthorized manner without obtaining necessary license or approval as required by the regulation.
As the regulation has mandatorily required approval of the ministry in order to distribute the content through the internet in Nepal, it is worth observing to see whether the foreign companies providing such services to the users based in Nepal comply. Due to the limited market of users in Nepal, it is less likely the service providers would be willing to register in Nepal as it may also trigger other compliance requirement as per the laws of Nepal. Further, it would be important to see what the government’s next step would be as the regulation is silent on the time period to comply with such requirements and what would it do to foreign OTT service providers if they fail to comply with the licensing requirement of the regulation.

I was first introduced to Panauti by John Sanday, the British conservation architect, who was in charge in the 1970s of the restoration of Hanuman Dhoka palace at the center of Kathmandu by UNESCO and has resided in the Nepali capital from that time on.
It was in 1976. I was already familiar with Nepal and the Kathmandu Valley. I had been the cultural attaché at the French Embassy in 1970-71, and afterward spent nearly one year in the remote Newar village of Pyangaun in Lalitpur district, a village inhabited by Jyapu paddy-cultivators. These farmers were also at that time makers of bamboo boxes for measuring grains (rice, wheat), pyang in Nepal Bhasha. They used to exchange these boxes against food grains at several localities of the Kathmandu Valley in winter. Subsequently, I prepared and passed a PhD dissertation in the field of social anthropology (Paris University) on that village and joined the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS), the main public organization for research in France, in 1975. I had learned local languages with students and teachers and was quite fluent at that time in Newari.
I remember very well my first time in Panauti with John Sanday. We were looking for a house to rent. The authorities of the locality guided us toward a Karmacharya family inhabiting in the lower part of the town, toward the sacred confluence of the Rosi and Punyamati rivers. The gharpatini, mistress of the house, and her daughter welcomed us. They offered us some food with very strong ayela (rice alcohol) and rented me a house nearby, with a very nice view of Indreshwar Mahadev temple and the Jangam math, the religious establishment where the priests of the Shaivite three-storied temple were inhabiting. The ground floor was used by a health post and a small vegetable garden was attached. It was an ideal place to work. It was decided that three young French architects would join me to undertake a full basic research work on Panauti. During our common period of fieldwork, we would focus on space and architecture. One of these architects, Vincent Barré, was already my friend. He came some years before to Pyangaun to help me draw a map of the village.
I moved to Panauti in the rainy season. I came on foot from Godavari with my cook and porter Sarkiman, crossing the range and descending on the other side of the mountain. We didn’t know the way exactly and got lost in the clouds. It was raining. We had to spend a night on the way in a Tamang house. We arrived at our destination the next morning. My three friends, who came by bus from Kathmandu the day before, were already there. We started the work immediately. Some inhabitants from Panauti joined us to draw a detailed map of the locality, which at that time didn’t exist. We set up three teams with local people for this topographical survey. It took us about 10 days to complete the preliminary job with double decameter ropes. All corners of the city were mapped. It must be said that from the very beginning Panauti inhabitants proved to be very friendly and cooperative with us. This assistance continued in all phases of the research. Perhaps they guessed that their locality would derive some benefits out of this research.
This happened to be true: some years later, in the 1990s, the cultural branch of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs started renovating the main temples of the city, that were in a sorry condition, under the supervision of the Nepali Department of Archaeology. Several other projects focused on more secular matters, especially schools, platforms alongside the streets and an underground pipe system were also launched and implemented. In addition, some grants were allocated to the local youths in the field of technology. Robert Le Foll, a former member of the French Parliament, has been very active in this regard. Panauti became a symbol of French and Nepali cooperation.
Three persons from Panauti collaborated with us in a very important and fruitful manner: Ananta Madhikarmi, Chandeshwari Buddhacharya (Shakya), Shiva Jangam, who at the time was the priest of Indreshwar Mahadev temple, and Bisunath Tamrakar. I remember that I surveyed with Ananta Madhikarmi all the houses of the small city, collecting data on the population, as well as on economic data of every family, for instance the surface area (in ropani) of their paddy-fields whether privately owned or just labored as tenants. The French architects stayed for about three months in Panauti and went back to Paris where they were running a private architect enterprise. For my own part, I concentrated the following years almost entirely on Panauti city, its social and religious organization. My rented house was very convenient. I could invite some guests and friends from Kathmandu for lunch or for the weekend. It was also an appropriate place to work with my different local informants and offer them some tea. During the daytime, I used to spend time in the various tea stalls discussing with people on different subjects. And every night, I took a tour of the city along the river and within the market area. I made fantastic day trips with Ananta in the surrounding villages and religious places.
Altogether, I spent nearly one year on the spot, from 1977 till 1980. At the end, I offered a bhoj (a feast) to all the persons, Newars and Jangams mostly, who worked with me in the community. I had to sacrifice a goat to the nearby Ganesh on that occasion. Afterward, I presented my ethnographical materials in the Paris University in 1982 and obtained a second more elaborate PhD, after the first one obtained thanks to my study of Pyangaun. We call this superior type of Doctorate “Doctorat d’Etat” in French (this type of Doctorate disappeared from the university courses a little later). With the French architects, our common book written in French language was finally published in 1981 in Paris: Panauti, uneville au Népal (Panauti, a Town in Nepal). It is focused on history, social organization, use of space, domestic and religious architecture. A facsimile edition has been published recently in Kathmandu by Vajra Publications. Unfortunately, this book has not yet been translated in English or Nepali.
In 1976, Panauti, a multi-caste locality, counted around 2,900 inhabitants, among which the vast majority were Newars (97%). It was a small historic city with an important market hub and a great number of pasals (shops) where the surrounding villagers could buy nearly all the items they needed. The market extension at the entrance of the locality, near the Maneshwari (Varahi) temple, already existed in its primary form. It developed dramatically in the following years, destabilizing the life of the small city and redirecting the market activities from the center to the periphery.
In my views, the small town of Panauti can be analyzed through two main different paradigms: the mandalic (or cosmological) model and the socioeconomic change paradigm. I had already recently published a book with a number of photographs on the second aspect: Panauti: Past and present (1976-2020). Let me focus here on the mandalic structure.
At first, the triangular shape of the city is clear. Panauti lies at the confluence of two rivers: the Punyamati to the north, and the Rosikhola to the south. The top of the triangle is pointed to the east. It is believed that a third river—subterranean, invisible river—supposedly flowing from the north under the Brahmayani three-storied temple, meets there. This third hidden river conveys a high sacral aura to the spot. The ritual place, called triveni (confluence of three rivers), is located at this junction and contains many religious monuments. This important religious confluence is visited by religious people every morning and evening. The inhabitants of the surrounding villages come there for cremation.
This triveni confluence gives to Panauti the status of a famous pilgrimage site, known all over central Nepal and even in Northern India. Every 12 years, the Makar Mela (fair) is celebrated on that very place, in the solar month of Magh (January-February). On that occasion, thousands of pilgrims wash away their sins by bathing at the confluence of the three rivers. I described this festival in a long article published 10 years ago in a volume called Sin and Sinners (Brill, 2012). According to the inhabitants, the city has a form of a fish. The main temple of Indreshwar Mahadev, originally built in the 13th century by a Newar princess named Birma Devi and run by Jangam (Lingayat) priests, is related to this religious confluence. The outer impressive struts, which decorate the religious monument with eminent figures of Hindu mythology, are a testimony of the antiquity of the temple. In 1977, we asked the children of Panauti to draw a map of their city, as they imagined. All represented their locality in a triangular form, the triveni oriented upward, to the north, giving to the city the form of a mountain (except one who placed the apex of the triangle downward).
Yet, this structure is not enough to understand the city. In the 1970s, the urban zone of Panauti was still clearly separated from the outside by an outer circle of eight goddesses’ temples, dedicated to the Ashta (eight) Matrika of the Hindu-Buddhist Tantric tradition. A specific direction in space corresponds to each of these goddesses. They protect the city against diseases and evil spirits and are regularly worshipped on specific days of the lunar calendar. The temple of Brahmayani, is the most important of these religious monuments. It faces the confluence of the rivers, on the opposite bank of the city.
This outer religious ring is centered on a large esplanade located at the epicenter of the old city, which is called layku, royal palace, by the local people. Located nearby, a small altar is dedicated to the ancient divinity and guardian deity of the Newar Malla kings, the Taleju goddess. Offerings are made there every year, during Dashain festival (mostly in October). This zone is presently under archaeological investigation by the Nepali Department of Archaeology. As a matter of fact, during a temporary period of the medieval age, Panauti had been the seat of a small independent or semi-independent kingdom/principality. In addition, as all Newar settlements, Panauti is divided between an upper part (thane) and a lower part, (kwane) according to the direction for the nearby river. This division passes through the “royal” center of the city.
This geometrical spatial structure, a center surrounded by eight temples supposedly located in the eight directions of the universe, gives to Panauti the form of a mandala religious diagram, a micro-representation of the universe. The Karmacharyas who are presently the Tantric priests of these goddesses’ sanctuaries, still have a clear vision of this cosmic configuration. It was applied to Panauti during the Malla medieval time to convey to the locality a royal status and to give her a prestigious microcosmic image of the universe. In this regard, Panauti can be considered as a reduced form of the neighboring larger Hindu city of Bhaktapur, where the German researchers (Kölver and Gutschow) have uncovered a similar layout, associated with identical religious representations. As I showed in my research works, the mandalic structure of the city still dominates the religious life of Panauti and comes in full light during the main religious festival celebrated there, particularly during Dashain celebrations and the main jatra (festival, procession) of the city, in the month of May, just before the rainy season: the Jyaa Punhi festival.

The Nepal Academy has recently published photojournalist Bharat Bandhu Thapa's picture book 'Nepal in Pictures'.
The 320-page book includes over 500 photographs depicting tourism, arts, culture and society from Mechi in the east to Mahakli in the west and the height of Mt Everest to the lowlands of Kechanakaval. 
""My objective was to ensure that those who want to know Nepal get to see the main views and know the main specialties of the country in a single book. I was, therefore, working on it for a long time,"" Thapa tells Setopati. ""Nepal is such a big country that it is not possible to include the whole country in 320 pages. But I have tried to include different possibilities of the country as far as I know in this book.""
He added that the book will be polished further in the future. 
The pictures in the books depict places from Olangchung Gola in the east to Kalapani in the Far West, Khaptad, Badimalika, Upper Dolpo, Lumbini, Janaki Temple, Shukaphant to the culture of the Kathmandu Valley. ""Most of the pictures in the book have been clicked by me. But I have not travelled across the whole country. I was undecided about whether to include the places I have not visited or not,"" he reveals. ""I finally decided that those places should not be excluded from the book even if I have not visited.""
He has sought photos of those places from his friends and says that has prevented the book from being incomplete.

122,blog,https://en.setopati.com/blog/157720,"
I want to preface this blog by clarifying that what I am positing here is not an attack on anybody’s personal integrity but an attempt to reveal a tendency, perhaps all too human, that often underpins our political biases and colors our vision in such a way that we lose sight of the future.
The political bias I am going to describe here is something that I prefer to call as “the bias of the present,” or, in other words, the tendency to view current political climate as though it is going to continue as it is forever in the future. Adam Gopnik, a popular writer for the US-based magazine, “The New Yorker,” calls it “presentism,” which he defines as, “an assumption that what is happening now is going to keep on happening, without anything happening to stop it.” I prefer to use the word “bias” because of the unreasonable prejudice attached to this kind of thinking.
This kind of bias in thinking is now famously attributed to Francis Fukuyama, the renowned political thinker, who, at one time, declared that the world had come to an “end of history” with liberal capitalist democracies being the climactic endpoint. Fukuyama, who is still pilloried for his rather Panglossian view, argued that countries all over the world were becoming more freer, more liberal, more tolerant, and getting closer and closer to a utopia very similar to the liberal democracies in the West. Fukuyama’s grand utterances are seen today as a cautionary—and an instructive—moment for public intellectuals who are inclined to make sweeping claims about the future by simply looking at the current trends.
Sadly, the current Bibeksheel Sajha Party (BSP), which was supposed to represent the optimism of the youths in the country, seems to be doing a Fukuyama in reverse. Rabindra Mishra and his like-minded coterie in the current BSP formed after the recent purges, are engaged in an overly pessimistic portrayal of present Nepal and have accordingly projected a pessimistic future for the country as though the situation can only get worse from here. Under Mishra, the current BSP apparatus seems almost eager to see the current situation spiral out of control so that their egos will be satisfied, and their recently espoused political lines, vindicated. But in so doing, Mishra and the BSP have not only led the movement of the youths astray but have also muddled the public perception by overestimating their own power while underestimating the fundamental feature of a democracy, namely its auto-correctional tendencies.
In the past BSP was popular among the youths because the party embodied the hopes and optimism that can only spring from the resourceful idealism and energy of the young people. No one expected BSP to form a viable alternative to the prevailing political parties, but everyone took pleasure from the fact that the youths were raising the consciousness of the public by demanding accountability from public officials and showing a new possibility for the future. Alongside the civil society, BSP stood at a sweet spot (call it the Goldilocks of Nepali politics), just outside the fray of everyday politics, but also within it in such a way that it could act both as a party, demanding accountability and good governance, but also as an idealisticentity that projected an optimistic and much-needed normative framework for the future of the country’s politics. The party was extremely successful given its limited reach and resources. The demonstrations against Nepal Banda, in particular, became a huge success while the party also gained enormous support in its fight against government corruption and incompetency, especially in the demonstrations against increasing instances of rapes and sexual assaults around the country.
The party was doing exactly what it was supposed to do until Mishra woke up one morning and blindsided his own party members—who had sacrificed their youthful energy, time, and resources—by highjacking the party and free riding on its goodwill. An idealistic party that represented hope for the future was overnight turned into an in-group that delighted in the same muck that it was supposed to transcend.
Now, there is no doubt that Rabindra Mishra is a gentleman who is genuinely worried about the current state of affairs in the country. In fact, as someone who is extremely self-aware of his public persona, Mishra, in my opinion, is willing to maintain a level of honesty and transparency that has not yet been seen from any of our leaders. There is no doubt in his honest endeavors. However, a nice coiffeur and a bright persona can only take you so far when the political line you have chosen depends on painting a dark picture. Mishra has, either wittingly or unwittingly, narrowed the imagination of the youths in the country by taking their movement to a dead end. He has done a great disservice by putting his ego before the ethos of the youths.
Most importantly though, Mishra and the current BSP are omitting a fundamental difference between the current political system—however flawed—that we have versus the system that they are advocating for: the system that we currently have has an inbuilt feature that will slowly but effectively autocorrect its mistakes, while the system that the current BSP is advocating for has an inbuilt bug that will only rear its ugly head again and again.
Like many others, I looked at BSP as a party of youths who were not beholden to any established political power. Despite its limited clout, the party was able to transcend the filth of Nepali politics and demand accountability by galvanizing the youths who brought new energy, vision, and optimism to an otherwise ossified party culture in Nepal. Just as the Nepali people were only beginning to believe and share the idealism of the youths, the bias of the present took over BSP and brought the project to a screeching halt.

As someone steeped in liberal values it certainly feels odd and slightly uneasy to defend a leader who carried—or perhaps still carries—a huge baggage of totalitarian ideology that is antithetical to my own political beliefs. Despite the deep-seated cognitive dissonance, however, I am making a pitch for a liberal Prachanda not because I condone his actions as a supremo of the armed uprising, but because I think his political survival is necessary for a progressive and forward-looking Nepal that is focused on the principles of individual rights and dignity. Despite his personal and political flaws, which he himself has openly acknowledged on several occasions—a rare instance among Nepali politicians or any politicians for that matter—I believe that Prachanda has been a force who has championed the liberal cause in Nepal. At a time when zealotry is rearing its head and the moderates are hobbled by their own incompetency and lack of leadership, Prachanda’s political survival has become indispensable to prevent the country from sliding backwards from its social and political gains.
Even as the country continues to wobble under the weight of egotistical power jockeying of a few politicians (including Prachanda), there has in fact been some significant progress in matters of individual rights, minority rights and their access to justice in the past few years. For all its destruction, any reasonable person who is not driven by personal agendas, will agree that the Maoist Revolution empowered the section of the population that had heretofore been relegated to live as second-class citizens. It is safe to say that the Maoist uprising threw away the yoke of arbitrary customs and traditions that had kept the minorities in positions of permanent subservience and has compelled the hitherto Kathmandu-centric governments to pay attention to broader Nepal, beyond the metropolis. To be sure, the Maoists opened the floodgates for both the good and the bad, and there is no doubt that Prachanda’s earlier misgivings toward the multiparty democratic system weakened both his political standing as well as people’s trust in the newly established system. Unfortunately, but not surprisingly, the progressive political achievements are now under attack as some political opportunists try to roll back the clock by undermining every liberal value—from secularism to constitutionalism to republicanism.
It is in this context I believe that Nepal needs a liberal Prachanda more than ever. Not the self-serving Prachanda confined to his doctrinal ideology who is always on the lookout for opportunities to burnish his personal image, but a Prachanda who speaks to and champions the needs of the poor, the marginalized and the vulnerable. Nepal needs a Prachanda who consistently keeps the interest of the vulnerable and the marginalized at the front and center of his politics and is guided by a moral imperative to do good for those who have been wronged in the name of caste, creed, geography, or economic status. Nepal needs a liberal Prachanda who doesn’t engage in an unwarranted nationalistic jingoism, who doesn’t make over-the-top ridiculous claims, who doesn’t engage in short-sighted tactical power brokerage, but a Prachanda who is less a politician than a moral character who transcends—or at least tries to transcend—partisan politics. Nepal needs a Prachanda who isn’t afraid to lose elections, but nevertheless finds ways to champion the causes of the less privileged. Nepal needs a Prachanda who is chastised by his past mistakes, who isn’t hungry for power, who is ready to forgo the limelight, and who understands that he doesn’t always have to be at the center of power and politics to do good.
Perhaps I might be asking too much from Prachanda, for how can Prachanda live without being Prachanda, a leader who shot to power by brute force of the gun? How can the man, the rebel, and the commander abandon his core ideology that revolves around power grabbing and gaining control of the state? The road ahead may be difficult, but it is doable. The name Prachanda now needs a complete makeover as does the character behind the name. Prachanda needs to start a revolution once again, but this time the revolution should be internal, within himself, and the guiding principles of that revolution should be morality, equality, and justice. Nepal doesn’t necessarily need a Prachanda in power, but it needs the voice of a liberal Prachanda who can lead a moral revolution toward an open, tolerant, kind, and just Nepal.

Menstruation is a part of the reproductive cycle; it is as natural as any secretion that your body discharges. It is a monthly reality for billions of women and girls around the globe. A natural biological process, which should dignify women and girls, has become a subject of shame due to taboos and myths that exclude women from many aspects of socio-cultural life. Despite the advancement in societal understanding, identifying menstruation as ‘impure’ is still deeply embedded in religion, cultural belongings, and societal practices.
Nepali society is also prey to the regressive mindset and social practice regarding menstruation. The taboo of vaginal discharge has put women at the back in society all through ages. From religious texts like Swasthanikatha, to story of Rishi Panchami all exemplify how menstruation is a sin and how women are victims of this natural process. The story of Rishi Panchami follows a woman named Sushila who entered the kitchen while menstruating during her past life. This was her biggest sin, and due to which she was reborn as a dog to be treated like one. Her husband in return is also reincarnated as a bull carrying the sin of his wife. The heartrending part is, we as Hindus glorify these myths and perform a yearly ritual on Rishi Panchami just to wash our sin of menstruating away. When we hear these myths we wonder, if goddesses Parvati, Laxmi, Saraswoti, Kali, Durga ever menstruated? If they did, how come they are prayed throughout the year, even during that time of the month?
Nepali societies in the past have exaggerated the myth surrounding menstruation and have twisted their own product of what menstruation shall actually be. Followed by a lot of don’ts: don’t sit there, don’t touch that, don’t enter the kitchen, don’t touch water source, don’t sleep in the bed, don’t wear the same clothes, don’t stay in the home and whole bunch of don’ts follows. Such taboos about menstruation present in many societies impact girls’ and women's emotional state, mentality and lifestyle, and most importantly, health. A lot of these superstitions are behavioral restrictions that, aside from being untrue, contribute to gender-based discrimination. Every adolescent girl has to miss her school and every woman has to sacrifice social functions, festivals, and daily life only because she is born to be the carrier of life. These “don’ts” have taken the lives of many women, in the form of Chhau (shed for menstruating women) or unhealthy menstruating practices. Yet, we claim that women are treated as equal in our society. How unfortunate!
The mentality of impure and untouchable has transcended from rural villages to posh educated families of suburban and urban cities of Nepal. It’s an embarrassment that highly educated families like ours are still practicing this taboo inflicted by our regressive society. Despite being a woman of modern thoughts and ideologies, we are chained by these ‘don’ts’ just because we are too vulnerable to hurt the religious sentiments of our parents and the regressive society which means everything to them. 
Despite the government's efforts on criminalizing any kind of discriminatory behavior during menstruation, and demolishing menstrual huts in Achham, Surkhet, Dailekh, Bajhang, Salyan and other districts, the practice is still present loud and proud in every household of the country. The poignant part is that everyone is getting so used to this practice that it is not seen as discrimination. Society is evolving, people are adapting to all sorts of technologies and innovations, they are challenging their way of life yet their mindset is static and changing that has been a slow burn.""Everyone wants change, but no one wants to change"". The challenge, of addressing the socio-cultural taboos and beliefs in menstruation, is compounded by the lack of knowledge and understanding of puberty, menstruation, and reproductive health. Thus, there is a need to follow a strategic approach to combat these issues.
The solution to all this is simple and can be covered by one word “MINDSET”. Unless we change our mindset and grow out of the religious stigma, this practice is going nowhere. Rather than taking it as a shame, it’s about time we celebrated it as the greatest gift of human life. We all were born because there was someone menstruating; it’s a celebration of life, celebration of womanhood, and celebration of women power. Rather than being whispered in ears and wrapped in newspapers, it shall be a normal day act. Just think about it, men secrete sperms every single day, we do not consider them untouchables. Women do the same thing once a month and there is all the fuss about that.  To change the mindset and outlook at this boon (currently misunderstood as sin), there is still a long way to go and the journey starts with you.

President Xi JInping warned against meddling in China’s dealings with Taiwan during a phone call with his U.S. counterpart, Joe Biden, that gave no indication of progress on trade, technology or other irritants, including Beijing’s opposition to a top American lawmaker’s possible visit to the island democracy, which the mainland claims as its own territory.
Xi also warned against splitting the world’s two biggest economies, according to a Chinese government summary of Thursday’s unusually lengthy, three-hour call. Businesspeople and economists warn such a change, brought on by Chinese industrial policy and U.S. curbs on technology exports, might hurt the global economy by slowing innovation and increasing costs.
Meanwhile, Xi and Biden are looking at the possibility of meeting in person, according to a U.S. official who declined to be identified further. Xi has been invited to Indonesia in November for a meeting of the Group of 20 major economies, making it a potential location for a face-to-face meeting.
The Chinese government gave no indication Xi and Biden discussed possible plans by U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to visit Taiwan, which the ruling Communist Party says has no right to conduct foreign relations. But Xi rejected “interference by external forces” that might encourage Taiwan to try to make its decades-old de facto independence permanent.
“Resolutely safeguarding China’s national sovereignty and territorial integrity is the firm will of the more than 1.4 billion Chinese people,” said the statement. “Those who play with fire will perish by it.”
The tough language from Xi, who usually tries to appear to be above political disputes and makes blandly positive public comments, suggested Chinese leaders might believe Washington didn’t understand the seriousness of previous warnings about Taiwan.
Taiwan and China split in 1949 following a civil war that ended with a Communist victory on the mainland. They have no official relations but are linked by billions of dollars of trade and investment. Both sides say they are one country but disagree over which government is entitled to national leadership.
A Ministry of Defense spokesman said ahead of Thursday’s call that Washington “must not arrange for Pelosi to visit Taiwan.” He said the ruling party’s military wing, the People’s Liberation Army, would take “strong measures to thwart any external interference.”
Xi called on the United States to “honor the one-China principle,” the statement said, referring to Beijing’s position that the mainland and Taiwan are one country. The United States, by contrast, has a “one-China policy” that says Washington takes no position on the question but wants to see it resolved peacefully.
“Both sides of the Taiwan Strait belong to one and the same China,” the statement said.
The statement cited Biden as saying the United States doesn’t support independence for Taiwan.
Coverage of the conversation in China’s entirely state-controlled media on Friday was limited to repeating government statements.
Pelosi has yet to confirm whether she will go to Taiwan, but if she does, the Democrat from California would be the highest-ranking elected American official to visit since then-Speaker Newt Gingrich in 1997.
Beijing criticized Gingrich for saying the United States would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese attack but did little else in response to his three-hour visit to the island.
Since then, China’s position on Taiwan has hardened as the mainland economy grew to become second-largest after the United States. The ruling party poured hundreds of billions of dollars into developing fighter jets and other high-tech weapons including “carrier killer” missiles that are thought to be intended to block the U.S. Navy from helping to defend the island.
The conflict over a possible Pelosi visit is more sensitive to Beijing in a year when Xi, who took power in 2012, is expected to try to break with tradition and award himself a third five-year term as party leader.
Xi, who wants to be seen as restoring China’s rightful historic role as a global leader, has promoted a more assertive policy abroad. The PLA has sent growing numbers of fighter planes and bombers to fly near Taiwan in an attempt to intimidate its democratically elected government.
The United States has no official relations with Taiwan but has extensive commercial ties and informal political connections. Washington is obliged by federal law to see that Taiwan has the means to defend itself.
Xi called for cooperation on reducing the risk of economic recession, coordinating macroeconomic policies, fighting COVID-19 and “de-escalation of regional hot spots,” according to the government statement.
He also warned against decoupling, or separating, the U.S. and Chinese economies for strategic reasons.
Businesspeople and industry analysts have warned global industries might be split into separate markets with incompatible products due to China’s pressure on its own companies to develop their own technology standards and U.S. restrictions on Chinese access to technology that Washington see as a security risk. That might slow innovation and increase costs.
“Attempts at decoupling or severing supply chains in defiance of underlying laws would not help boost the U.S. economy,” the statement said. “They would only make the world economy more vulnerable.”

When the bill to decriminalize suicide in Malaysia was finally tabled in parliament, lawmakers were supportive of the government’s plan and believe it is a progressive way forward for mental health reforms. 
The bills were tabled for the first reading by the Minister in the Prime Minister's Department (Law and Institutional Reform), Azalina Othman Said and the second reading of the bills will be tabled during the next sitting. The effort was initiated in 2020 to help prevent suicide attempts, destigmatize suicide and encourage those suffering to get the help and treatment they need. Malaysia's Health Ministry voiced support the following year as the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated the need to address mental health issues. However, the crime of aiding and abetting suicide under sections 305 and 306 of the Penal Code will still remain but with heftier punishment for cases involving vulnerable groups. 
The efforts to decriminalize suicide in Malaysia have spurred a series of engagement sessions and meetings with government agencies, parliamentarians, state assemblymen and relevant ministries. This mirrored a similar campaign in India, where stakeholder engagement played a crucial role in highlighting the importance of decriminalizing suicide. The discussions in Malaysia provided an opportunity for experts and policymakers to explore viable strategies and recommendations that can enhance mental health support once suicide is no longer considered a criminal offense. 
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), suicide claims the lives of more than 700,000 individuals worldwide annually, which equates to one life lost every 40 seconds with 77 percent of these deaths in low and middle-income countries. Suicide is the fourth leading cause of death for those aged between 15 and 29. There are still at least 17 countries, including Malaysia, where suicidal behavior is a criminal offense. In Malaysia it carries a maximum penalty of up to three years in prison.
Many survivors suffer from an underlying mental health condition. They are not just denied the support they need but — along with family members — also face possible arrest or threats. These remnant laws of British colonial rule view suicide as a transgression against God. Interestingly, acceptance of the concept that mental or emotional distress is biological in nature, exacerbated by the environment and other physical factors has helped society toward becoming more sensitive to this issue. Hence, there have been numerous calls to repeal the law. 
What happens after Malaysia decriminalizes suicide is pivotal. The effort is already undermined by numerous competing factors even at the proposal stage. There is a grave imbalance between the need to protect the sanctity of human life, the entwined religious and cultural belief system, and the right to self-determination, among others.
The reluctance to repeal the law is heavily influenced by the lingering legacy of British colonial rule that considers the act of criminalizing attempted suicide as deterring others from committing the same 'sin'. Regardless that there is insufficient data supporting the decrease in the suicide rate, criminalization continues to be a convenient avenue in addressing situations as foreign as suicidal behavior and that 'the law is doing something'. It is no surprise this has resulted in a vague interpretation of Malaysia's Section 84 of the Penal Code and Section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code relating to criminal responsibility and fitness to plead, suggesting that repealing Section 309 of the Penal Code is unnecessary.
These provisions are applicable to those charged under Section 309 and are said to be a better alternative than removing Section 309 altogether. While Section 342 pertains to evaluating an individual's ability to stand trial and fitness to plead, Section 309 criminalizes attempted suicide. 
The process under Section 342 involves a lengthy evaluation process that may take up to a month in a designated psychiatric hospital while individuals who are tried under Section 309 require immediate action by enforcement officers to safeguard the well-being of the individual. Based on a study, not all patients who were charged for attempting suicide within the premises of the psychiatric hospital were assigned for assessment under Section 342 based on the discretion of the magistrate. This process questions the effectiveness of the provision to allow for critical mental health support for people who attempt suicide.
Criminalizing suicide is rarely associated with positive changes in preventing suicide though decriminalizing has its own uncertainties. One study indicated an inconsistent relationship between decriminalization and the suicide rate. In Canada and Ireland, suicide rates increased after suicide was decriminalized in 1972 and 1993 respectively.
However, suicide rates in Sri Lanka had decreased since attempted suicide was decriminalized in 1998. This may have been due to suicide prevention initiatives implemented following the repeal of the law.
The uncertain outcomes of decriminalizing suicide may have impeded efforts in a conservative and religious country like Malaysia despite growing calls for action since 2019, with another push by the health ministry in 2020 when it proposed a moratorium on the prosecution and conviction of suicide attempts.
In 2021, several groups renewed their call for Section 309 of the Penal Code to be repealed after years of advocating the issue. Unfortunately, things are divided between these groups and policymakers, stalling prospects of decriminalization.
Without a concerted effort by a coalition of groups working toward a common goal, it may take longer to build the momentum needed for an official action to roll out. This reflects the absence of shared evidence-based research in Malaysia in delineating common objectives and reliable information to inform dialogue and policy decisions. For instance, the Association of Women for Action and Research, a suicide prevention organization in Singapore, has shared its findings with the Singaporean government on the psychological repercussion of criminalization via case studies conducted among those who have attempted suicide. Carefully evaluating Section 309 of Singapore's Penal Code proved that scientific research can foster greater collaboration between stakeholders, resulting in more effective suicide prevention and support efforts.
Suicide has long been a subject of conflicting legal, ethical, medical, religious, cultural, and human rights outlooks. Each perspective holds different assumptions regarding the causes, consequences, and implications, which shape how we understand and address this issue. The presumption that there ought to be a repeal of the law reflects modern society, but the law alone may not solve everything. 
Reconciling the many concerns of various stakeholders requires the adoption of a collaborative care approach which centers on the provision of assistance and resources to individuals experiencing a crisis, with the primary objective of mitigating the imminent danger of harm and prioritizing safety. 
Legislators could go further than decriminalization and include improving access to mental health services, expanding the availability of mental health clinics and providers and reducing barriers — social stigma, cost and geography — to accessing mental health care. Malaysians are hopeful that with healthcare professionals onboard and an attorney-general chamber's report mentioned in Hansard, revisiting the Mental Health Act 2001 to improve on its response to address mental disorder issues will provide adequate protection of the rights of the patient and enable a shift from the management and treatment of mental illness to prevention and intervention initiatives.
Systematically analyzing a legislative move is among the lessons learned from India where despite the implementation of the Mental Health Care Act in 2017 and subsequent de facto decriminalization of suicide, suicide prevention efforts have stalled. As a result, police and health professionals are ill-equipped with adequate training and are inept at providing appropriate support to survivors. While the building of mental health resources and infrastructures is progressing, the government can focus its initiatives on destigmatizing suicide and encourage people to seek help through public education campaigns. 
The government has demonstrated a commendable commitment to reducing the stigma surrounding mental health issues by acknowledging the importance of mental health and resorting to a more empathetic approach for individuals with suicidal thoughts.
Decriminalizing suicide is just the beginning of a long and arduous journey toward creating a society that values the complexity of mental health issues and provides the necessary support. It signifies an unwavering commitment to advocating better mental health policies, breaking down the barriers that prevent individuals from receiving treatment and creating a safe and nurturing environment for everyone.

Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday visited command posts of the Kremlin’s forces fighting in Ukraine in an apparent effort to rally his troops as the war approaches its 14th month and Kyiv readies a possible counteroffensive with Western-supplied weapons.
A video released by the Kremlin and broadcast by Russian state television showed Putin arriving by helicopter at the command post for Russian forces in the southern Kherson region and afterward flying to the headquarters of the Russian National Guard of the eastern Luhansk region
Dressed in a dark suit, and in an apparent demonstration of authority, Putin appeared to chair the meetings with his military top brass. It was his second trip in two months to the Russian-occupied territories in the neighboring country.
The locations of the military headquarters in the Kherson and Luhansk regions weren’t disclosed, so it wasn’t possible to assess how close they are to the front line.
Russia’s war in Ukraine has turned into a stalemate amid heavy fighting in the country’s east, particularly around the town of Bakhmut, which for 8½ months has been the stage for the war’s longest and bloodiest fight.
In both locations, Putin congratulated the military on Orthodox Easter, which was celebrated Sunday and presented them with icons.
Russia annexed the Kherson and Luhansk regions along with the Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia regions in September in a move that was rejected by much of the world as illegal.
It was impossible to independently verify the authenticity of the video footage.
Last month, Putin visited the Russian-held Sea of Azov port city of Mariupol, which was captured by Russian troops in May after two months of fierce fighting.
Putin’s trips to the military headquarters come as Ukraine is preparing for a new counteroffensive to reclaim the occupied territories.
Ukrainian officials have said they’re buying time by depleting Russian forces in the battle while Kyiv prepares a counteroffensive. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has argued that if Russia wins the Bakhmut battle, it could allow Putin to begin building international support for a deal that would require Ukraine to make unacceptable compromises to end the war.
Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, told The Associated Press in an interview in Kyiv that Ukraine’s allies are helping the government to achieve the level of technical equipment necessary to launch the attack, delivering heavy armored vehicles and ammunition.
He expressed confidence that Ukraine will be able to return all its occupied territories.
“We will defeat Russia,” he said. “If you have a strong inner spirit, you will definitely win. And we always had it strong. This is something that always annoyed the Russians.”

Sudan’s embattled capital awoke Monday to a third day of heavy fighting between the army and a powerful rival force for control of the country, as the weekend’s civilian death toll rose to 97.
Airstrikes and shelling intensified in parts of Khartoum and the adjoining city of Omdurman. Rapid, A sustained firing was heard near the military headquarters, with white smoke rising from the area. Residents hunkering down in their homes reported power outages and incidents of looting.
“Gunfire and shelling are everywhere,” Wadeya Mahmoud Koko, head of a union for thousands of tea vendors and other food workers, said from her home in Khartoum.
She said a shell stuck a neighbor’s house Sunday, killing at least three people. “We couldn’t take them to a hospital or bury them.”
The clashes are part of a power struggle between Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan, the commander of the armed forces, and Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, the head of the Rapid Support Forces, a paramilitary group. The two generals are former allies who jointly orchestrated an October 2021 military coup that derailed Sudan’s short-lived transition to democracy.
Both men have dug in, saying they would not negotiate a truce, instead engaging in verbal attacks and demanding the other’s surrender. Still, both have powerful foreign backers, making them potentially susceptible to mounting diplomatic pressure.
Since fighting erupted on Saturday, 97 civilians have been killed and hundreds have been wounded, said the Sudan Doctors’ Syndicate, a pro-democracy group monitoring casualties.
There has been no official word on the number of fighters killed.
Footage posted online Monday purported to show RSF barracks in Omdurman. The bodies of dozens of men in camouflage uniforms were seen sprawled on beds and the floor of a medical ward and in a sandy outdoor area.
The authenticity of the videos could not be confirmed independently, but they surfaced after the military said it has targeted RSF bases with airstrikes. Mohmed al-Mokhtar al-Nour, an RSF adviser, told the Al Jazeera satellite network Sunday that RSF forces have withdrawn from the camp.
The chaotic scenes of fighting with tanks, truck-mounted machine guns, artillery and warplanes in densely populated areas of the capital are unprecedented. Sudan has a long history of civil strife, but much of that has taken place in remote tribal areas, far from Khartoum.
Fighting also spread to the war-wrecked western Darfur region, and areas of northern and eastern Sudan, near the borders with Egypt and Ethiopia.
The violence erupted during the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan which ends later this week and is capped by the three-day Eid al-Fitr holiday.
The battles created more hardships for Sudan where about 16 million people, or one-third of the population, depend on humanitarian assistance.
Over the weekend, the World Food Program suspended operations in Sudan after three employees were killed in the western Darfur region. On Monday, the International Committee of the Red Cross also said it was halting its work because of the conflict, with the exception of a refugee camp in the southeast.
On Sunday, the warring sides agreed to a three-hour pause in fighting to allow civilians to stock up on necessities. Compliance was spotty, and there were reports of casualties during the humanitarian pause. Volker Perthes, the U.N. envoy for Sudan, called out the breaches Monday and urged both sides to “ensure the protection of all civilians.”
Koko, the head of the tea vendors’ union, said Burhan and Dagalo must stop fighting and withdraw troops from residential areas. “We, the people, want to live in peace,” she said. “We want security.”
Top diplomats urged the sides to stop fighting, including the U.S. secretary of state, the U.N. secretary-general, the EU foreign policy chief, the head of the Arab League and the head of the African Union Commission. The U.N. Security Council was to discuss the developments in Sudan later on Monday.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken renewed his call for a truce and a return to negotiations during a meeting of the Group of Seven wealthy nations in Japan on Monday.
“People in Sudan want the military back in the barracks,” he said. “They want democracy. They want the civilian-led government, Sudan needs to return to that path.”
The fighting also spread to the war-wrecked western Darfur region, and areas of northern and eastern Sudan, near the borders with Egypt and Ethiopia.
In recent months, negotiations had been under way to get back on a path to democracy. Under international pressure, Burhan and Dagalo agreed to a framework agreement with political parties and pro-democracy groups.
However, the deal was vague on key points of dispute, including how the RSF would be integrated into the armed force and who would have final control. The signing of the deal was put off repeatedly, amid rising tensions between Burhan and Dagalo.
The fighting marks a deadly setback for Sudan, a resource-rich nation strategically located at the crossroads of Africa and the Arab world. Only four years ago, Sudan inspired hope after a popular uprising helped depose long-time autocratic leader Omar al-Bashir.

The Sudanese military and a powerful paramilitary group battled for control of the chaos-stricken nation for a second day Sunday, signaling they were unwilling to end hostilities despite mounting diplomatic pressure to cease fire.
Heavy fighting involving armored vehicles, truck-mounted machine guns and war planes raged Sunday in the capital of Khartoum, the adjoining city of Omdurman and in flashpoints across the country. The rival forces are believed to have tens of thousands of fighters each in the capital alone.
At least five civilians were killed and 78 wounded Sunday, bringing the two-day toll to 61 dead and more than 670 wounded, said the Sudan Doctors’ Syndicate. The group said it believes there were dozens of additional deaths among the rival forces.
The clashes are part of a power struggle between Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan, the commander of the armed forces, and Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, the head of the Rapid Support Forces group. The two generals are former allies who jointly orchestrated an October 2021 military coup that derailed Sudan’s short-lived transition to democracy.
In recent months, internationally backed negotiations revived hopes for such a transition, but growing tensions between Burhan and Dagalo eventually delayed a deal with political parties.
Volker Perthes, the U.N. envoy for Sudan, said that both Burhan and Dagalo agreed to a three-hour humanitarian pause in fighting in the late afternoon Sunday, but violence continued to engulf the capital.
As night fell, residents reported heavy explosions and continued gunfire, as well as airstrikes pounding RSF targets. The clashes come as most Sudanese are preparing to celebrate the holiday that marks the end of the holy month of Ramadan, when Muslims traditionally fast from sunrise to sunset.
Fighting raged around the military’s headquarters throughout the day. “Heavy explosions and gunfire around the clock,” said Amany Sayed, a 38-year-old Khartoum resident. “The battles here (in the capital) never stopped.”
In Khartoum and Omdurman, fighting was also reported around Khartoum International Airport and state television headquarters. A senior military official said clashes with RSF fighters began earlier in the day around military headquarters.
“They are shooting against each other in the streets,” said prominent rights advocate Tahani Abass who lives near the military headquarters. “It’s an all-out war in residential areas.”
Abass said her family spent the night huddling on the ground floor of their home. “No one was able to sleep and the kids were crying and screaming with every explosion,” she said. Sounds of gunfire were heard while she was speaking to The Associated Press.
Satellite images analyzed by the AP showed columns of black smoke covering the sky over the capital’s airport. The images by Maxar Technologies showed two large planes on fire, and four others damaged. Airlines have suspended flights to the Sudanese capital.
The military and the RSF both claimed to be in control of strategic locations in Khartoum and elsewhere in the county. Their claims couldn’t be independently verified.
Both sides signaled that they were unwilling to negotiate.
Burhan’s military called for dismantling the RSF, which it labeled a “rebellious militia.” Dagalo told the satellite news network Al Arabyia that he ruled out negotiation and called on Burhan to surrender.
Khalid Omar, a spokesman for the pro-democracy block that negotiated with the generals in recent months, warned that the conflict could lead to war and the country’s collapse.
In a series of tweets Sunday, Omar called on pro-democracy groups to set aside their disputes to find a way to end the crisis “immediately”.
Meanwhile, diplomatic pressure appeared to be mounting.
Top diplomats, including the U.S. Secretary of State, the U.N. secretary-general, the EU foreign policy chief, the head of the Arab League and the head of the African Union Commission urged the sides to stop fighting. Members of the U.N. Security Council, at odds over other crises around the world, called for an immediate end of the hostilities and a return to dialogue.
The African Union’s top council called Sunday for an immediate cease-fire “without conditions.” It also asked the AU Commission Chairman Moussa Faki Mahamat to “immediately travel to Sudan to engage the parties towards a cease-fire.”
Arab states with stakes in Sudan — Qatar, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates — made similar appeals. Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Farhan bin Faisal spoke by phone with Sudan’s rival generals and urged them to stop “all kinds of military escalation,” Saudi state TV reported.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he consulted with the foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. “We agreed it was essential for the parties to immediately end hostilities without pre-condition,” he said in a statement early Sunday.
On Sunday, the World Food Program said it temporarily suspended operations in Sudan after three agency employees were killed in clashes the previous day and an aircraft used by the WFP was damaged.
“We cannot do our lifesaving work if the safety and security of our teams and partners is not guaranteed,” said Cindy McCain, the executive director of the agency. About 16 million people, or one-third of Sudan’s population, require humanitarian assistance, according to the U.N.
The rival forces were fighting in several locations across Sudan, including the western Darfur region where tens of thousands of people live in camps for displaced people after years of genocidal civil war.
The three WFP employees were killed in clashes in the town of Kebkabiya in the province of North Darfur. Two agency employees were wounded.
Dozens of people were also killed and wounded since Saturday at a camp for displaced people in North Darfur, said Adam Regal, a spokesman for a Darfur charity.
In Nyala, the capital of South Darfur province, the two sides fought for control of the city’s airport, said a military official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief media.
The official said fighting also spread to the eastern region, including the provinces of Kassala and al-Qadarif on the borders with Ethiopia and Eritrea. He said battles centered around RSF and army bases.
The recent tensions stem from disagreement over how the RSF, headed by Dagalo, should be integrated into the armed forces and what authority should oversee the process. The merger is a key condition of Sudan’s unsigned transition agreement with political groups.
Pro-democracy activists have blamed Burhan and Dagalo for abuses against protesters across the county over the past four years, including the deadly break-up of a protest camp outside the military’s headquarters in Khartoum in June 2019 that killed over 120 protesters. Many groups have repeatedly called for holding them accountable. The RSF has long been accused of atrocities linked to the Darfur conflict.
Sudan, a country at the crossroads of the Middle East and Sub-Saharan Africa, is known for its history of military coups and civil conflicts since it gained independence in 1950s. A decade-old civil conflict resulted in the secession of South Sudan in 2011.
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for those responsible for the death of civilians, including three employees with the U.N. food agency, to be held accountable, according to his spokesman, Stéphane Dujarric.
The U.N. Security Council will discuss the crisis in Sudan on Monday, said Fedor Strzhizhovskiy, the spokesman for the U.N. mission of Russia, which holds the council’s presidency this month.

Alabama law enforcement officers Sunday were imploring people to come forward with information about a shooting that killed four people and injured 28 others during a teenager’s birthday party.
Among those killed was a high school senior who planned to play college football and was celebrating his sister’s 16th birthday. The shooting erupted Saturday night at a dance studio in downtown Dadeville.
During two news conferences Sunday, Sgt. Jeremy Burkett of the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency did not take questions. He did not say if a suspect was in custody or if investigators knew about any motivation. He did not provide the names of those killed.
“We’ve got to have information from the community,” Burkett said during a Sunday evening news conference.
Philstavious “Phil” Dowdell, a Dadeville High School senior who had committed to Jacksonville State University, was celebrating at his sister Alexis’ party before he was shot to death, his grandmother Annette Allen told the Montgomery Advertiser.
“He was a very, very humble child. Never messed with anybody. Always had a smile on his face,” Allen told the newspaper, calling it “a million-dollar smile.”
Dowdell’s mother was among those hurt in the shooting.
“Everybody’s grieving,” Allen said.
Burkett said the shooting occurred about 10:30 p.m. Saturday. “There were four lives tragically lost in this incident,” he said.
The shootings rocked the city of 3,200 residents, which is about 57 miles (92 kilometers) northeast of Montgomery, Alabama.
Keenan Cooper, the DJ at the party, told WBMA-TV that the party was stopped briefly when attendees heard someone had a gun. He said people with guns were asked to leave, but no one left. Cooper said when the shooting began some time later, some people took shelter under a table where he was standing, and others ran out.
Pastor Jason Whetstone, who leads the Christian Faith Fellowship, said the granddaughter of one of his church members was shot in the foot and underwent surgery Sunday.
“All of our hearts are hurting right now. We’re just trying to pull together to find strength and comfort,” Whetstone said before an interfaith vigil in the parking lot of First Baptist Church.
“We are a loving community,” he said. “We’re pulling together in every aspect to comfort each and every one of these children, the teachers, all of the community.”
Dadeville’s compact downtown is centered around a courthouse square with one- and two-story brick buildings. The town’s busiest commercial district is a few blocks north of the square, off a bustling four-lane highway that runs between Birmingham and Auburn. Dadeville is close to Lake Martin, a popular recreational area.
Investigators on Sunday continued filing in and out of the Mahogany Masterpiece dance studio, denoted by a banner hanging on the outside of a one-story brick building just off the square. At least five bullet holes were visible in the studio’s front windows. Less than a block away, the American and Alabama flags were lowered to half staff outside the Tallapoosa County Courthouse.
Dadeville Mayor Frank Goodman said he was in bed asleep when a council member called him just before 11 p.m. Saturday. He said he went to Lake Martin Community Hospital in Dadeville, where some of the people who had been shot were taken.
“It was chaotic,” Goodman said. “There were people running around. They were crying and screaming. There were police cars everywhere, there were ambulances everywhere. People were trying to find out about their loved ones. That was a scene, where we never had anything like this happen in our city before.”
Pastor Ben Hayes, who serves as chaplain for the Dadeville Police Department and for the local high school football team, said most of the victims are teenagers. Dowdell was within weeks of graduation and faced a bright future, Hayes told The Associated Press.
“He was a strong competitor on the field,” Hayes said. “You didn’t want to try to tackle him or get tackled by him. But when he came off the field, he was one of the nicest young men that you could ever meet, very respectful and well-respected by his peers.”
Antojuan Woody, from the neighboring town of Camp Hill, was a senior and fellow wide receiver with Dowdell on a Dadeville Tigers football team that went undefeated before losing in the second round of the playoffs last year. He said he and Dowdell had been best friends for all of their lives. “It hurts,” Woody said as a steady stream of friends and teammates walked over to hug him during Sunday’s prayer vigil. “It’s unreal. I can’t believe it.”
Woody said he and Dowdell had a special relationship on the football field. “Us being friends forever like that, our chemistry was spot on. We always celebrated together on the field,” he said.
He described the victims “as great people who didn’t deserve what happened to them.”
Hayes, the pastor, said worried families swarmed the local hospital Saturday night trying to find the condition of their children. He said serious crime is rare in Dadeville, and the small city is “sad, traumatized, in shock.”

Jacksonville State football coach Rich Rodriguez said in a statement Sunday: “Our thoughts and prayers are with the family of Philstavious Dowdell and the other victims of the senseless tragedy last night. He was a great young man with a bright future.”
Dowdell also recently won medals at a high school track meet at Troy University.
Counseling will be available for students at Tallapoosa County schools Monday, said the school district superintendent, Raymond C. Porter.
“This morning, I grieve with the people of Dadeville and my fellow Alabamians. Violent crime has NO place in our state, and we are staying closely updated by law enforcement as details emerge,” Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey said on social media.
President Joe Biden was briefed on the shooting, the White House said, adding that it is closely monitoring the situation and has been in touch with local officials and law enforcement to offer support.
“What has our nation come to when children cannot attend a birthday party without fear? When parents have to worry every time their kids walk out the door to school, to the movie theater, or to the park?” Biden said in a statement Sunday. “Guns are the leading killer of children in America, and the numbers are rising – not declining. This is outrageous and unacceptable.”
Biden called on Congress to “require safe storage of firearms, require background checks for all gun sales, eliminate gun manufacturers’ immunity from liability, and ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.”
The mayor said Dowdell was “a great young man.” He also said he is concerned about those wounded and psychologically traumatized by the shooting.
“We are praying for them,” Goodman said. “We ask God, if it’s his will, to bring them back to their parents safe, so they can mend.”
Goodman said guns and violence are not a frequent presence in Dadeville. He said trying to control guns would prove as futile as trying to control illegal drugs.
Dadeville High School had 485 students in grades 6-12 in 2022, according to Alabama state data. It serves Dadeville and nearby parts of Tallapoosa County. Like the rest of Dadeville, it’s tucked away just out of view off a busy highway that runs from Birmingham to Auburn.
Dadeville High’s head football coach Roger McDonald said he would try his best to support grieving students.
“There’s not a playbook for something like this,” he said. “So the best you’ve got to do is just love on your kids, let them all know how much you care about them, be there for them.”
McDonald said Dowdell had something special.
“He was a leader, and as far as his ability, an electrifying player,” the coach said.
Michael Taylor, an assistant coach, said he met Dowdell when the boy was 9 and coached him in youth football. Taylor said the team was invited to Atlanta to play in the stadium used by the NFL’s Atlanta Falcons.
“He did some amazing things there, and he never stopped doing them since then,” he said. “He was the No. 1 athlete in the school.”
Taylor said he last heard from Dowdell on Friday, when Dowdell was seeking video of his athletic exploits. Taylor said he drove to the shooting scene Saturday night from his home in nearby Camp Hill.
“Man, I couldn’t get close,” Taylor said. “So once I found out what’s going on, I really I just had to leave because it was going to be all night.”
Taylor said he returned Sunday to see Dowdle’s body carried out from the dance studio. He said he’s not sure what he will tell other athletes Monday.
“The first thing we’ve got to do is we’ve got to pray our way out of this,” Taylor said Sunday. “There ain’t no other way. And then I can tell you, they’re all real close like family at the high school.”
This is at least the second time in recent years that multiple people were shot in Dadeville. Five people were wounded in July 2016 during a shooting at an American Legion hall, and a man was later charged with five counts of attempted murder, news outlets reported.

French President Emmanuel Macron’s unpopular plan to raise France’s retirement age from 62 to 64 was enacted into law Saturday, the day after the country’s constitutional body approved the change.
Macron’s signature and publication in the Official Journal of the French Republic allowed the law to enter into force. The authorized changes will start being implemented in September, French government spokesperson Olivier Veran said.
On Friday, the Constitutional Council rejected some parts of the government’s pension legislation but approved the higher minimum retirement age, which was central to Macron’s plan and the focus of opponents’ protests.
The nine-member council’s decision capped months of tumultuous debates in parliament and fervor in the streets. Spontaneous demonstrations took place in Paris and across the country after the ruling.
France’s main labor unions, which organized 12 nationwide protests since January in hopes of defeating the plan, have vowed to continue fighting until it is withdrawn. They called for another mass protest on May 1, which is International Workers’ Day.
The government argued that requiring people to work two years more before qualifying for a pension was needed to keep the pension system afloat as the population ages; opponents proposed raising taxes on the wealthy or employers instead, and said the change threatened a hard-won social safety net.
Opinion polls show Macron’s popularity has plunged to its lowest level in four years. The centrist president, who made raising the retirement age a priority of his second term, plans to make a televised national address on Monday evening, Macron’s office said.
“The president’s remarks are very much awaited” and will both seek to appease tensions in the country and explain decisions that have been made in the past months regarding the pension reform, government spokesperson Veran said.
Macron was first elected in 2017 on a promise to make France’s economy more competitive, including by making people work longer.
Since then, his government has made it easier to hire and fire workers, cut business taxes and made it more difficult for the unemployed to claim benefits.

The death toll from Russian missile strikes on eastern Ukraine’s city of Sloviansk rose to 11 Saturday as rescue crews tried to reach people trapped in the rubble of an apartment building, Ukrainian authorities said.
Ukraine’s air force said the country would soon have weapons with which to try to prevent attacks like the one on Friday. The delivery of the Patriot air defense system promised by the U.S. was expected in Ukraine sometime after Easter, Ukrainian air force spokesperson Yuriy Ihnat said.
The primarily Orthodox Christian country is preparing to observe Easter on Sunday. Speaking Saturday on Ukrainian state TV, Ihnat declined to give a precise timeline for the arrival of the defensive missile system but said the public would know “as soon as the first Russian aircraft is shot down.”
A group of 65 Ukrainian soldiers completed their training last month at Fort Sill, a U.S. Army post in Oklahoma, and returned to Europe to learn more about using the defensive missile system to track and shoot down enemy aircraft.
Officials said at the time that the Ukrainians would then go back to their country with a Patriot missile battery, which typically includes six mobile launchers, a mobile radar, a power generator and an engagement control center.
Germany and the Netherlands also have pledged to provide a Patriot system each to Ukraine. In addition, a SAMP/T anti-missile system pledged by France and Italy “should enter Ukraine in the near future,” Ihnat said this week.
The Ukrainian military is looking to beef up its ability to intercept missiles as it prepares for an expected spring counter-offensive to retake Russian-occupied areas of the country. Although more than a year of fighting has depleted weapons supplies on both sides, Russian forces have intensified their 8 1/2-month campaign to seize the city of Bakhmut, the focus of the war’s longest battle so far.
Bakhmut and Sloviansk are located about 45 kilometers (28 miles) apart in eastern Ukraine’s Donetsk province.
Rescue teams in Sloviansk recovered the bodies of two people from under the rubble of a house hit in Friday’s missile strikes, according to the State Emergency Service. They also searched Saturday for five people who remained in the wreckage of the apartment building, as well as the residents of three units who were reported missing, Vadym Liakh, the head of the local government, said.
Separately, a 48-year-old woman and her 28-year-old daughter died Saturday after Russian forces shelled a neighborhood of the city of Kherson, the regional administration said on Telegram. The southern port city was occupied by Russian forces in the early months of the war, but Ukrainian forces regained control of it in November, one of the most notable battlefield defeats for Moscow.
A new law signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday that allows military offices to send draft notices electronically instead of delivering them in person is part of Russia’s preparation for a protracted war in Ukraine, the U.K. Defense Ministry said in a Saturday morning assessment.
According to British intelligence, a “unified registry of individuals eligible for military service” will be digitally linked to other government services, allowing Russian authorities to “punish draft-dodgers by automatically limiting employment rights and restricting foreign travel.”
Since the law does not come into force until later in the year, the U.K. Defense Ministry said the e-notices do not automatically point to a “major new wave of enforced mobilization” but rather form part of a “longer-term approach to provide personnel as Russia anticipates a lengthy conflict in Ukraine.”
Meanwhile, 52,000 young Russian men already have received draft orders as part of the country’s regular spring call-up, and 21,000 of them qualified for military service, Col. Andrey Biryukov, who is in charge of mobilization, said Saturday.
Biryukov addressed concerns that the new electronic conscription law presaged a broader mobilization of reservists, like one Putin ordered in September.
“I’d like to stress that all army deferrals for citizens will still be valid. And e-draft orders will not be mailed in bulk,” Biryukov said.

Ukraine’s foreign minister said Thursday his country won’t budge from its demand that Russia withdraw its forces from Crimea, as well as from other parts of Ukraine that Moscow illegally annexed more recently, for the war to end.
Calling the conflict in Ukraine “a bleeding wound in the middle of Europe,” Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said all his country’s territory must be treated equally in dealing with the Kremlin after its full-scale invasion more than 13 months ago.
“We are united by U.N. charter principles and the shared conviction that Crimea is Ukraine and it will return under Ukraine’s control,” Kuleba said, speaking by video link to a gathering in the Romanian capital, Bucharest.
“Every time you hear anyone from any corner of the world saying that Crimea is somehow special and should not be returned to Ukraine, as any other part of our territory, you have to know one thing: Ukraine categorically disagrees with these statements,” he said at the Black Sea Security Conference.
Russia took over Crimea in 2014, and during the current war has expanded its presence there. Occasional acts of sabotage and other attacks against Russian military and other facilities on the peninsula have occurred since, with the Kremlin blaming Ukraine. The Kyiv government hasn’t claimed responsibility for the attacks but welcomes efforts to repel the Russian presence there.
The Kremlin wants Kyiv to acknowledge Russia’s sovereignty over Crimea and also recognize September’s annexation of the Ukrainian provinces of Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk, and Zaporizhzhia.
Ukraine has rejected those demands and won’t hold talks with Russia until Moscow’s troops pull back from all occupied territories.
Though there is no sign of possible peace negotiations, the two countries have sporadically exchanged prisoners of war and have engaged in a wartime deal for the export of Ukrainian grain and Russian grain and fertilizers. The grain deal has helped ease concerns about the global food supply, especially to countries in Africa, the Middle East and parts of Asia where many are already struggling with hunger.
The agreement, which the U.N. and Turkey brokered last July, is delicate, however, and Moscow has repeatedly threatened to end it.
In the latest dispute, Russia’s Foreign Ministry said Thursday that no discussion about extending the Black Sea grain deal beyond May 18 would take place until progress was made towards resolving what it called “five systemic problems” that have resulted from sanctions on Russia over the war.
It said in a statement those issues were: reconnecting the state-owned Russian Agricultural Bank to the SWIFT international banking system; resuming supplies to Russia of agricultural machinery, spare parts and services; lifting restrictions on insurance and reinsurance and the ban on access to ports; restoring the operation of the Tolyatti-Odesa ammonia pipeline; and unblocking foreign assets and accounts of Russian companies related to the production and transportation of food and fertilizers.
Russia agreed last month to extend the grain deal for 60 days — instead of the 120 days set under a previous extension — to send a warning to the West.
On the battlefield, military analysts say, an anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive in coming months could aim at the land corridor between Russia and Crimea, hoping to split Russia’s forces in two.
That would be a daunting military challenge. Satellite images show the Kremlin’s forces are digging extensive trench systems between mainland Ukraine and the Black Sea peninsula.
The fighting in recent months has become a war of attrition, with neither side able to gain momentum over the winter and often resorting to long-range bombardment.
At least four civilians were killed and 11 were wounded in the latest Russian barrages that continued to hit civilian infrastructure, Ukraine’s presidential office said Thursday.
The Ukrainian military said Russian forces over the previous 24 hours launched 32 airstrikes, two missile strikes and 40 attacks from multiple rocket launchers.
In other developments:
— Russia’s Prosecutor General’s Office has opened an investigation into a video appearing to show the beheading of a Ukrainian serviceman that appeared online this week, according to the government department’s press service. It said it intended “to assess the reliability of these materials.” Ukraine on Wednesday also launched an investigation into what it alleged was the latest atrocity blamed on Russia since it invaded in February 2022.
— A Russian mine exploded near a generator room at one of the reactors of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Ukraine’s state nuclear operator Energoatom said. “Russian occupiers continue to turn the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant into a military base, mining the perimeter,” Energoatom wrote on Telegram. The head of the U.N.’s atomic energy agency confirmed the landmine explosion and reported one had also occurred last Saturday. Rafael Grossi of the International Atomic Energy Agency said: “At a time of growing speculation about military offensives and counteroffensives in the region, it is more important than ever to agree that a nuclear power plant should never be attacked, nor used to launch attacks from. I will not rest until this has been achieved.”
Europe’s largest nuclear plant has six reactors, all of which have been shut down over the past year. The U.N.’s atomic energy agency has been trying for months to obtain agreement between Ukraine and Russia on securing the plant, whose reactors and other equipment still require an external electricity supply to operate safety systems.

Former US President Donald Trump answered questions for nearly seven hours Thursday during his second deposition in a legal battle with New York’s attorney general over his company’s business practices, reversing an earlier decision to invoke his Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination and remain silent.
The Republican met all day with lawyers for Attorney General Letitia James, who sued Trump last year. Her lawsuit claims Trump and his family misled banks and business associates by giving them false information about his net worth and the value of assets such as hotels and golf courses.
Shortly after Trump entered the Manhattan skyscraper that houses James’ offices, his attorney, Alina Habba, said he was “not only willing but also eager to testify.”
After the deposition was finished, a lawyer for Trump’s businesses, Christopher Kise, said the former president had spent nearly seven hours “describing in detail his extraordinary business success.”
“The transactions at the center of this case were wildly profitable for the banks and for the Trump entities,” Kise said. “When the facts of this success, and not politically engineered soundbites, are out in the open, everyone will scoff at the notion any fraud took place.”
The lawsuit is unrelated to the felony criminal charges filed against Trump by the Manhattan district attorney, which led last week to his historic arraignment, the first for a former president.
James declined to answer a question about the deposition at a news conference on an unrelated matter Wednesday.
Trump previously met with James’ lawyers Aug. 10, but refused to answer all but a few procedural questions, invoking his Fifth Amendment rights more than 400 times. At the time, James had not yet brought her lawsuit and it was unclear whether questions about the way Trump valued his company would become the basis of a criminal case.
“Anyone in my position not taking the Fifth Amendment would be a fool, an absolute fool,” he said in that deposition, which was recorded on video and later released publicly. Trump predicted a “renegade” prosecutor would try to make a criminal case out of his answers, if he gave them.
“One statement or answer that is ever so slightly off, just ever so slightly, by accident, by mistake, such as it was a sunny, beautiful day, when actually it was slightly overcast, would be met by law enforcement at a level seldom seen in this country, because I’ve experienced it,” he said.
Circumstances since then have changed. The criminal charges brought by the Manhattan district attorney focused on how the company accounted internally for payments to a lawyer, Michael Cohen, for his work paying off people not to go public with stories about extramarital sexual encounters Trump said never happened.
James’ lawsuit focused on allegations that Trump lied repeatedly about his own wealth and exaggerated the value of his assets on financial statements.
In a social media post Thursday morning, Trump called the suit “ridiculous, just like all of the other Election Interference cases being brought against me.”
He raised a fist as he left his apartment at Trump Tower in the morning, arriving by motorcade at the attorney general’s office around 9:40. The two sides took a break for lunch. Trump departed in the motorcade just before 6:15 p.m. and did not stop to speak to reporters.
The lawsuit James brought is scheduled to go to trial in October. Video recordings of Trump’s depositions could potentially be played at the trial, if the lawsuit is not settled.
Thursday’s deposition was conducted in private.

Leaked U.S. intelligence documents suggesting Washington spied on South Korea have put the country’s president in a delicate situation ahead of a state visit to the U.S., the first such trip by a South Korean leader in 12 years.
The documents contain purportedly private conversations between senior South Korean officials about Ukraine, indicating that Washington may have conducted surveillance on a key Asian ally even as the two nations publicly vowed to reinforce their alliance.
Since taking office last year, conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol has put a bolstered military partnership with the United States at the heart of his foreign policy to address intensifying North Korean nuclear threats and other challenges. The April 26 summit with President Joe Biden is seen as crucial to winning a stronger U.S. security commitment and resolving grievances over the Biden administration’s economic and technology policies.
The leaked documents were posted online as part of a major U.S. intelligence breach. The papers viewed by The Associated Press indicate that South Korea’s National Security Council “grappled” with the U.S. in early March over an American request to provide artillery ammunition to Ukraine.
The documents, which cited a signals intelligence report, said then-NSC Director Kim Sung-han suggested the possibility of selling the 330,000 rounds of 155 mm munitions to Poland, since getting the ammunition to Ukraine quickly was the United States’ ultimate goal.
South Korea, a growing arms exporter, has a policy of not supplying weapons to countries at war. It has not provided arms directly to Ukraine, although it has shipped humanitarian aid and joined U.S.-led economic sanctions against Russia.
Yoon’s government said it discussed the leaked papers with the United States, and they agreed that “a considerable number” of the documents were fabricated. The South Korean government avoided any public complaints about the U.S. and did not specify which documents were faked.
“There’s no indication that the U.S., which is our ally, conducted (eavesdropping) on us with malicious intent,” Kim Tae-hyo, Seoul’s deputy national security director, told reporters Tuesday at Dulles Airport near Washington at the start of a trip aimed at preparing for the summit.
Senior Biden administration have discussed the leaks with allies at high levels and sought to reassure them of the U.S. government’s commitment to safe-guarding intelligence. The administration also sought to downplay the impact the leak would have on Yoon’s upcoming visit.
“Our commitment to the Republic of Korea remains ironclad, and President Biden looks forward to welcoming President Yoon to the White House for the upcoming state visit to discuss their shared commitment for a strong and deeply integrated U.S.-ROK Alliance that maintains peace, stability, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific and beyond,” the White House National Security Council said in a statement, using South Korea’s official name.
The Yoon government’s stance invited criticism from liberal rivals, who called on the government to lodge strong protests with the U.S. They also suspected what they call Yoon’s hasty relocation of his presidential office to a Defense Ministry compound in central Seoul may have left the office vulnerable to wiretapping.
“As a sovereign nation, we must sternly respond to the spying of state secrets, even if it was committed by an ally with whom (South Korea) has bonded over blood,” said Park Hong-geun, floor leader of the main liberal opposition Democratic Party.
In an official statement, Yoon’s office said it maintains tight security, including anti-eavesdropping systems. It called the opposition party’s attempts to link the office relocation to the spying allegation “diplomatic suicidal acts” that shake South Korea’s national interests and its alliance with the U.S.
The situation is unlikely to threaten the country’s alliance with the U.S. that was forged during the 1950-53 Korean War, many experts say.
“No big damage is expected on the Korea-U.S. alliance as it seems both governments share the view that they would focus on the alliance, more concretely on a successful state visit by Yoon,” said Bong Young-shik, an expert at Seoul’s Yonsei Institute for North Korean Studies.
If Yoon returns with some achievements, Koreans will conclude that he put up with the spying allegations “because bigger matters were at stake,” Bong said. But if the visit amounts to ”a pomp-only trip,” people could question whether South Korea “made lots of concessions.”
One possible achievement for Yoon would be if South Korea takes on a role in the management of U.S. nuclear weapons in the face of North Korea’s advancing nuclear arsenal.
Other wins would be securing U.S. benefits for major South Korean businesses involved in the making of electric vehicles and easing U.S. restrictions on technology exports to China, which has been a major manufacturing base for South Korean chipmakers.
If the U.S. intends to help Yoon, “the latest incident on the documents could end up strengthening the Korea-U.S. alliance and helping South Korea win something from the U.S,” said Kim Yeol Soo, an expert at South Korea’s Korea Institute for Military Affairs.
Kim Tae-hyung, a professor at Seoul’s Soongsil University, said the exposure of possible U.S. spying could help Seoul maintain its existing policy of not supplying weapons to Ukraine. But it’s also possible that the Yoon government reconsiders that policy now that the U.S. demands are public, Kim said.
Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, South Korea has agreed to provide billions of dollars’ worth of tanks, howitzers, fighter jets and other weapons to Poland, a NATO member.
An American official said in November that the United States had agreed to buy 100,000 artillery rounds from South Korean manufacturers to provide to Ukraine, although South Korean officials have maintained that the munitions were meant to refill depleted U.S. stocks.
Choi Jin, director of the Seoul-based Institute of Presidential Leadership, said it’s also no secret that allies spy on each other, as well as their adversaries.
The U.S. wiretapping activities “are something that everyone already knows,” although it becomes a more sensitive matter when the practice is made public, Choi said.
“I think South Koreans also try to wiretap (U.S. officials) as well,” Choi said. “People feel animosity toward the word ‘wiretapping.’ But in other words, it’s called intelligence gathering.”

 Prince Harry will attend his father’s coronation, Buckingham Palace said Wednesday, ending months of speculation about whether the prince would be welcome after leveling charges of racism and media manipulation at the royal family.
His wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, will remain at the couple’s home in Southern California with their two young children, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet, the palace said. A nearly identical statement from the Sussex’s representatives confirmed the news.
The May 6 date of the coronation at Westminster Abbey coincides with their son’s birthday.
While the announcement should silence the “will he or won’t he” debate in the British media, it won’t end the royal soap opera swirling around Harry and Meghan as King Charles III prepares for his coronation.
When the prince attended the funerals of his grandfather, Prince Philip, and his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, commentators discussed everything from whether Harry would be allowed to wear his military uniform to exactly where he was seated. And there is always the question of whether he will meet face-to-face with his father and older brother, Prince William.
That intrigue will only be heightened after Harry and Meghan stoked their critique of the royal family in a six-part Netflix series about their decision to step back from royal duties three years ago, which was followed by Harry’s decision to reveal family secrets in his bestselling memoir “Spare.”
Harry and Meghan, who is biracial, have alleged she faced racist attitudes from both the palace and the U.K. press. The treatment contributed to their decision to leave the country.
The revelations in “Spare,″ including details of private conversations with his father and brother, Prince William, fanned tensions between Harry and his family that became public when he and his wife moved to North America in 2020.
The book also included allegations that members of the royal family regularly feed the press unflattering information about other members of the House of Windsor in exchange for positive coverage of themselves.
The prince singled out Camilla, the queen consort, accusing her of leaking private conversations to the media as she sought to rehabilitate her image after marrying Charles. Camilla was once reviled for her long-term affair with Charles, which contributed to the breakdown of his marriage to the late Princess Diana, Harry and William’s mother.
The acrimony between Harry and his family once again spilled into public view last month when the Sussexes said that they had been asked to vacate their home in Britain.
Frogmore Cottage, a royal residence on the grounds of Windsor Castle west of London, was the couple’s main residence before they gave up royal duties and moved to Montecito, a wealthy enclave in Southern California.

Ukraine wants India to play a bigger role in helping end Russia’s war, its deputy foreign minister said Tuesday during the first visit by a senior Ukrainian official to India since the war began last year.
India “can play a bigger and greater role” and Ukraine would “welcome any effort that is directed at resolving the war,” Emine Dzhaparova said.
She made the comments in a speech at the Indian Council of World Affairs, a think tank in New Delhi, after meeting with her Indian counterpart, Sanjay Verma, and other officials.
Dzhaparova has sought to use her visit to deepen ties with India, which has refrained from condemning Russia’s role in the war and has abstained several times from voting on U.N. resolutions against Moscow. Instead, New Delhi has stressed the need for diplomacy and dialogue on ending the war and has expressed its willingness to contribute to peace efforts.
Dzhaparova said she hopes Indian officials including National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, who visited Moscow in February and held talks with President Vladimir Putin, will also visit Kyiv.
“We would be happy to welcome Indian officials to Kyiv,” she said.
Russian officials are expected to visit India in coming weeks for meetings of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, which the country is chairing this year.
India depends on Russia for nearly 60% of its defense equipment and has ramped up its purchases of low-priced Russian oil since the war in Ukraine began.
On Monday, Dzhaparova warned India against an over reliance on Russia.
“India should be pragmatic in diversifying its energy resources, military contracts and political interactions. Because what we see in my country when you are dependent on Russia, they will always use this blackmail instrument,” she told reporters.
India also holds the rotating presidency of the Group of 20 leading rich and developing nations this year. As host, India has cast itself as a rising superpower while leveraging its position on the global stage to bridge the gap between the West and Russia.
Dzhaparova urged India to use its presidency to spotlight the crisis in Ukraine by inviting Ukrainian officials to the G-20 events and summit, which will be held in September.
She said her visit was “a mark of friendship” and hoped it would kickstart Ukraine’s dialogue with India. “Let us make Ukraine more visible in India, let us help Ukraine to tell its own story, let us also bring India closer” to Ukraine, Dzhaparova said.

Airstrikes by Myanmar’s military on Tuesday killed as many as 100 people, including many children, who were attending a ceremony held by opponents of army rule, said a witness, a member of a local pro-democracy group and independent media.
The military is increasingly using airstrikes to counter a widespread armed struggle against its rule, which began in February 2021 when it seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi. More than 3,000 civilians are estimated to have been killed since then by security forces.
A witness told The Associated Press that a fighter jet dropped bombs directly onto a crowd of people who were gathering at 8 a.m. for the opening of a local office of the country’s opposition movement outside Pazigyi village in Sagaing region’s Kanbalu township. The area is about 110 kilometers (70 miles) north of Mandalay, the country’s second-largest city.
About half an hour later, a helicopter appeared and fired at the site, said the witness, who asked not to be identified because he feared punishment by the authorities.
Initial reports put the death toll at around 50, but later tallies reported by independent media raised it to about 100. It was impossible to independently confirm details of the attack because reporting is restricted by the military government.
“I was standing a short distance from the crowd when a friend of mine contacted me on the phone about the approach of a fighter jet,” the witness said. “The jet dropped bombs directly on the crowd, and I jumped into a nearby ditch and hid. A few moments later, when I stood up and looked around, I saw people cut to pieces and dead in the smoke. The office building was destroyed by fire. About 30 people were injured. While the wounded were being transported, a helicopter arrived and shot more people. We are now cremating the bodies quickly.”
About 150 people had gathered for the opening ceremony, and women and 20 to 30 children were among the dead, he said, adding that those killed also included leaders of locally formed anti-government armed groups and other opposition organizations.
The United Nations, United States and others strongly condemned the attack and pledged to work toward holding the military accountable.
’This heinous act by the terrorist military is yet another example of their indiscriminate use of extreme force against innocent civilians, constituting a war crime,” the opposition National Unity Government said in a statement. The NUG calls itself the country’s legitimate government, in opposition to the army. The office being opened Tuesday was part of its administrative network.
The military government’s spokesperson, Maj. Gen. Zaw Min Tun, acknowledged in a statement phoned to state television MRTV that the ceremony had been attacked, but accused anti-government forces in the area of carrying out a violent campaign of terror. He said the People’s Defense Forces — the armed wing of the National Unity Government -- had terrorized residents into supporting them, killing Buddhist monks, teachers and other people, while the military sought peace and stability. He said there was evidence the attack had set off secondary blasts of explosives hidden by the People’s Defense Forces around the site.
In response to accusations of abuses, the military government often accuses pro-democracy forces of terrorism. But analysts for the United Nations and non-governmental organizations have gathered credible evidence of large-scale human rights abuses by the army, including the burning of entire villages and displacement of more than a million people, triggering a humanitarian crisis.
The death toll from Tuesday’s air attack, if confirmed, could be the highest in more than two years of civil conflict that began when the army seized power in 2021. As many as 80 people were killed last October in another government air attack in northern Myanmar on an anniversary celebration of the Kachin ethnic minority’s main political organization, which is also battling the military government.
Myanmar has been in turmoil since the army takeover triggered widespread popular opposition. After peaceful demonstrations were put down with lethal force, many opponents of military rule took up arms, and large parts of the country are now embroiled in conflict.
The army has been conducting major offensives in the countryside, where it has faced some of the toughest resistance in Sagaing, in Myanmar’s historic heartland. The resistance forces have no defense against air attacks.
In videos of the devastated village seen by AP, survivors and onlookers stumble through the area of the attack amid clouds of thick smoke, with only the skeleton frame of one building still standing in the distance. The videos could not immediately be verified but matched other descriptions of the scene.
Some motorbikes remained intact while others were reduced to their frames or buried under tree branches. In one area, two victims lay close together, one of whom had only one arm still attached.
Another victim lay face down in a small grove by the roadside. A few meters (yards) away, a small torso missing at least one limb could be seen.
In January, Myanmar’s top leader told the military it needs to take decisive action against those opposed to army rule. Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing said at a military parade on Armed Forces Day that those who condemned his government showed indifference to violence committed by its opponents.
Resistance forces have been able to prevent the military from taking firm control of large areas of the country, but have a great disadvantage in weapons, particularly in countering air attacks.
Critics of the military government advocate banning or limiting the sale of aviation fuel to Myanmar to cripple the military’s advantage in air power. Many Western nations have imposed arms embargoes on the military government, and the United States and Britain recently enacted new sanctions targeting individuals and companies involved in supplying jet fuel to Myanmar.
The human rights group Amnesty International said in a statement Tuesday that “The relentless air attacks across Myanmar highlight the urgent need to suspend the import of aviation fuel. Amnesty reiterates its calls on all states and businesses to stop shipments that may end up in the hands of the Myanmar Air Force.”
It also urged the U.N. Security Council to “push through effective actions to hold the Myanmar military accountable, including by referring the situation in the country to the International Criminal Court.”
The United Nations said those responsible for the attack must be brought to justice, with U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric stressing that the injured must receive medical treatment, which is “often a challenge in these circumstances.” Myanmar’s government-run hospitals are short on staff and supplies, and opponents of the military avoid them for safety reasons.
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres “condemns all forms of violence and reaffirms the primacy of protection of civilians, in accordance with international humanitarian law and reiterates his call for the military to end the campaign of violence against the Myanmar population throughout the country” as called for by the U.N. Security Council in a resolution adopted last December, Dujarric said.
The U.S. would continue to work with the international community to hold the military government accountable for violations and abuses, the State Department said in a statement.
“These violent attacks further underscore the regime’s disregard for human life and its responsibility for the dire political and humanitarian crisis in Burma,” said Vedant Patel, principal deputy spokesperson at the State Department, using Myanmar’s former name.

A Louisville bank employee armed with a rifle opened fire at his workplace Monday morning, killing five people — including a close friend of Kentucky’s governor — while livestreaming the attack on Instagram, authorities said.
Police arrived as shots were still being fired inside Old National Bank and killed the shooter in an exchange of gunfire, Louisville Metro Police Department Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel said. The city’s mayor, Craig Greenberg, called the attack “an evil act of targeted violence.”
The shooting, the 15th mass killing in the country this year, comes just two weeks after a former student killed three children and three adults at a Christian elementary school in Nashville, Tennessee, about 160 miles (260 kilometers) to the south. That state’s governor and his wife also had friends killed in that shooting.
In Louisville, the chief identified the shooter as 25-year-old Connor Sturgeon, who she said was livestreaming during the attack.
“That’s tragic to know that that incident was out there and captured,” she said.
Meta, the company that owns Facebook and Instagram, said in a statement that it had “quickly removed the livestream of this tragic incident this morning.”
Social media companies have imposed tougher rules over the past few years to prohibit violent and extremist content. They have set up systems to remove posts and streams that violate those restrictions, but shocking material like the Louisville shooting continues to slip through the cracks, prompting lawmakers and other critics to lash out at the technology industry for slipshod safeguards and moderation policies.
Nine people, including two police officers, were treated for injuries from the Louisville shooting, University of Louisville Hospital spokeswoman Heather Fountaine said in an email. One of the wounded, identified as 57-year-old Deana Eckert, later died, police said Monday night.
One of the wounded officers, 26-year-old Nickolas Wilt, graduated from the police academy on March 31. He was in critical condition after being shot in the head and having surgery, the police chief said. At least three patients had been discharged.
Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said he lost one of his closest friends in the shooting — Tommy Elliott — in the building not far from the minor league ballpark Louisville Slugger Field and Waterfront Park.
“Tommy Elliott helped me build my law career, helped me become governor, gave me advice on being a good dad,” said Beshear, his voice shaking with emotion. “He’s one of the people I talked to most in the world, and very rarely were we talking about my job. He was an incredible friend.”
Also killed in the shooting were Josh Barrick, Jim Tutt and Juliana Farmer, police said.
“These are irreplaceable, amazing individuals that a terrible act of violence tore from all of us,” the governor said.
It was the second time that Beshear was personally touched by a mass tragedy since becoming governor.
In late 2021, one of the towns devastated by tornadoes that tore through Kentucky was Dawson Springs, the hometown of Beshear’s father, former two-term Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear. Andy Beshear frequently visited Dawson Springs as a boy and has talked emotionally about his father’s hometown.
Beshear spoke as the investigation in Louisville continued and police searched for a motive. Crime scene investigators could be seen marking and photographing numerous bullet holes in the windows near the bank’s front door.
As part of the investigation, police descended on the neighborhood where the suspect lived, about 5 miles (8 kilometers) south of the downtown shooting. The street was blocked as federal and local officers talked to residents. One home was cordoned off with caution tape. Kami Cooper, who lives in the neighborhood, said she didn’t recall ever meeting the suspect but said it’s an unnerving feeling to have lived on the same street as someone who could do such a thing.
“I’m almost speechless. You see it on the news but not at home,” Cooper said. “It’s unbelievable, it could happen here, somebody on my street.”
A man who fled the building during the shooting told WHAS-TV that the shooter opened fire with a long rifle in a conference room in the back of the building’s first floor.
“Whoever was next to me got shot — blood is on me from it,” he told the news station, pointing to his shirt. He said he fled to a break room and shut the door.
Deputy Police Chief Paul Humphrey said the actions of responding police officers undoubtedly saved lives.
“This is a tragic event,” he said. “But it was the heroic response of officers that made sure that no more people were more seriously injured than what happened.”
Just a few hours later and blocks away, an unrelated shooting killed one man and wounded a woman outside a community college, police said.
The 15 mass shootings this year are the most during the first 100 days of a calendar year since 2009, when 16 had occurred by April 10, according to a mass killings database maintained by The Associated Press and USA Today in partnership with Northeastern University.
Going back to 2006, the first year for which data has been compiled, the years with the most mass killings were 2019 and 2022, with 45 and 42 mass killings recorded during the entire calendar year. The pace in 2009 slowed later in the year, with 32 mass killings recorded that year.

China’s military sent several dozen warplanes and warships toward Taiwan in a large-scale exercise that simulated sealing off the island in response to its president’s trip to the U.S.
The Chinese military earlier had announced three-day “combat readiness patrols” which it called Joint Sword, as a warning to Taiwan, a self-ruled island which China claims as its own. Beijing says contact between foreign officials and the island’s democratic government encourages Taiwanese who want formal independence, a step China’s ruling Communist Party says would lead to war.
The sides split in 1949 after a civil war, and the ruling party says the island is obliged to rejoin the mainland, by force if necessary. Military analysts suggest that in the event of a war, China may block sea and air traffic around Taiwan, preventing the United States, Japan or other nations from intervening or sending supplies to help the island defend itself.
China’s latest military actions follow President Tsai Ing-wen’s delicate diplomatic mission to shore up Taiwan’s dwindling alliances in Central America and boost its U.S. support, a trip capped with a sensitive meeting with U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in California. A U.S. congressional delegation also met with Tsai over the weekend in Taiwan after she returned.
China responded to the McCarthy meeting by imposing a travel ban and financial sanctions against those associated with Tsai’s U.S. trip and with increased military activity through the weekend.
On Monday morning, the Chinese People’s Liberation Army said its Shandong aircraft carrier for the first time was taking part in the exercises encircling Taiwan. It showed a video of a fighter jet taking off the deck of the ship, according to a post from the PLA’s Eastern Command on Weibo, the social media platform.
State broadcaster CCTV, citing the PLA, said the exercises are “simulating the joint sealing off” of Taiwan as well as “waves of simulated strikes” at important targets on the island.
Between 6 a.m. Sunday and 6 a.m. Monday, a total of 70 planes were detected and half crossed the median of the Taiwan Strait, an unofficial boundary once tacitly accepted by both sides, according to Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense. Among the planes that crossed the median were 8 J-16 fighter jets, 4 J-1 fighters, 8 Su-30 fighters and reconnaissance planes.
Later Monday morning, Taiwan’s defense ministry reported another 59 flights by bombers, as well as multiple fighter jets.
That followed a full day between Friday and Saturday, where eight warships and 71 planes were detected near Taiwan, according to the island’s Defense Ministry. The ministry said in a statement it was approaching the situation from the perspective of “not escalating conflict, and not causing disputes.”
Taiwan said it monitored the Chinese moves through its land-based missile systems, as well as on its own navy vessels.
China’s military harassment of Taiwan has intensified in recent years with planes or ships sent toward the island on a near-daily basis, with the numbers rising in reaction to sensitive activities.
In addition to combat readiness patrols, China’s PLA would hold “live fire training” in Luoyuan Bay in China’s Fujian province opposite Taiwan, the local Maritime Authority announced over the weekend.
Meanwhile, to the south in the South China Sea, the U.S. 7th Fleet said its missile destroyer USS Milius sailed by Mischief Reef in a freedom of navigation operation. China had built an artificial island on the sea feature to stake its claim to the disputed territory.
China said the U.S. “illegally trespassed” into waters near the reef without the permission of the Chinese government, according to a statement from the Chinese military’s southern command.
One of the U.S. representatives who attended the meeting with Tsai last week said Saturday the U.S. must take seriously the threat China posed to Taiwan. Republican Mike Gallagher, chairman of the U.S. House Select Committee on China, told The Associated Press that he plans to lead his committee in working to shore up the island government’s defenses, encouraging Congress to expedite military aid to Taiwan.

It was a celebratory atmosphere for officials gathered just hours away from several of India’s major tiger reserves in the southern city of Mysuru, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced Sunday to much applause that the country’s tiger population has steadily grown to over 3,000 since its flagship conservation program began 50 years ago after concerns that numbers of the big cats were dwindling.
“India is a country where protecting nature is part of our culture,” Modi proclaimed. “This is why we have many unique achievements in wildlife conservation.”
Modi also launched the International Big Cats Alliance that he said will focus on the protection and conservation of seven big cat species, namely, the tiger, lion, leopard, snow leopard, puma, jaguar and cheetah.
Protesters, meanwhile, are telling their own stories Sunday of how they have been displaced by wildlife conservation projects over the last half-century, with dozens demonstrating about an hour away from the announcement.
Project Tiger began in 1973 after a census of the big cats found India’s tigers were fast going extinct through habitat loss, unregulated sport hunting, increased poaching and retaliatory killing by people. It’s believed the tiger population was around 1,800 at the time, but experts widely consider that an overestimate due to imprecise counting methods in India until 2006. Laws attempted to address the decline, but the conservation model centered around creating protected reserves where ecosystems can function undisturbed by people.
Several Indigenous groups say the conservation strategies, deeply influenced by American environmentalism, meant uprooting numerous communities that had lived in the forests for millennia.
Members of several Indigenous or Adivasi groups — as Indigenous people are known in the country — set up the Nagarahole Adivasi Forest Rights Establishment Committee to protest evictions from their ancestral lands and seek a voice in how the forests are managed.
“Nagarahole was one of the first forests to be brought under Project Tiger and our parents and grandparents were probably among the first to be forced out of the forests in the name of conservation,” said J. A. Shivu, 27, who belongs to the Jenu Kuruba tribe. “We have lost all rights to visit our lands, temples or even collect honey from the forests. How can we continue living like this?”
Jenu, which means honey in the southern Indian Kannada language, is the tribe’s primary source of livelihood as they collect it from beehives in the forests to sell.
The fewer than 40,000 Jenu Kuruba people are one of the 75 tribal groups that the Indian government classifies as particularly vulnerable. Adivasi communities like the Jenu Kurubas are among the poorest in India.
Some experts say conservation policies that attempted to protect a pristine wilderness were influenced by prejudices against local communities.
The Indian government’s tribal affairs ministry has repeatedly said it is working on Adivasi rights. Only about 1% of the more than 100 million Adivasis in India have been granted any rights over forest lands despite a government forest rights law, passed in 2006, that aimed to “undo the historical injustice” for forest communities.
India’s tiger numbers, meanwhile, are thriving: the country’s 3,167 tigers account for more than 75% of the world’s wild tiger population.
Tigers have disappeared in Bali and Java and China’s tigers are likely extinct in the wild. The Sunda Island tiger, the other sub-species, is only found in Sumatra. India’s project to safeguard them has been praised as a success by many.
“Project Tiger hardly has a parallel in the world since a scheme of this scale and magnitude has not been so successful elsewhere,” said SP Yadav, a senior Indian government official in charge of Project Tiger.
But critics say the social costs of fortress conservation — where forest departments protect wildlife and prevent local communities from entering forest regions — is high.
Sharachchandra Lele, of the Bengaluru-based Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment, said the conservation model is outdated.
“There are already several examples of forests used actively by local communities and tiger numbers have actually increased even while people have benefited in these regions,” he said.
Vidya Athreya, the director of Wildlife Conservation Society in India who has been studying the interactions between large cats and humans for the last two decades, agreed.
“Traditionally we always put wildlife over people,” Athreya said, adding that engaging with communities is the way forward for protecting wildlife in India.
Shivu, from the Jenu Kuruba tribe, also wants to go back to a life where Indigenous communities and tigers lived together.
“We consider them gods and us the custodians of these forests,” he said.

Afghan religious scholars Saturday criticized a ban on female education, as a key Taliban minister warned clerics not to rebel against the government on the controversial issue.
Girls cannot go to school beyond sixth grade in Afghanistan, with the education ban extending to universities. Women are barred from public spaces, including parks, and most forms of employment. Last week, Afghan women were barred from working at the U.N., according to the global body, although the Taliban have yet to make a public announcement.
Authorities present the education restrictions as temporary suspensions rather than bans, but universities and schools reopened in March without their female students.
The bans have raised fierce international uproar, increasing the country’s isolation at a time when its economy has collapsed and worsenied a humanitarian crisis.
Two religious scholars who are well-known within Afghanistan said Saturday that authorities should reconsider their decision. Public opposition to Taliban policies is rare, although some Taliban leaders have voiced their disagreement with the decision-making process.
One scholar, Abdul Rahman Abid, said institutions should be permitted to re-admit girls and women through separate classes, hiring female teachers, staggering timetables, and even building new facilities.
Knowledge is obligatory in Islam for men and women, he told The Associated Press, and Islam allows women to study.
“My daughter is absent from school, I am ashamed, I have no answer for my daughter,” he said. “My daughter asks why girls are not allowed to learn in the Islamic system. I have no answer for her.”
He said reform is needed and warned that any delays are at the expense of the global Islamic community and also weakens the government.
Another scholar, who is a member of the Taliban, told the AP there is still time for ministries to solve the problem of girls’ education. Toryali Himat cited ministries comprising the inner circle of the supreme leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada, who is based in Kandahar.
It was on his orders that the government banned girls from classrooms. Himat said there are two types of criticism, one that destroys the system and another that makes corrective criticism.
“Islam has allowed both men and women to learn, but hijab and curriculum should be considered,” said Himat. “Corrective criticism should be given and the Islamic emirate should think about this. Where there is no criticism, there is the possibility of corruption. My personal opinion is that girls should get education up to university level.”
Acting Higher Education Minister Nida Mohammad Nadim said Friday that clerics should not speak against government policy.
He made his remarks after another scholar, Abdul Sami Al Ghaznawi, told students at a religious school that there was no conflict over girls’ education. He said Islamic scripture was clear that girls’ education was acceptable. Al Ghaznawi was not immediately available for comment.
Nadim appeared to target Al Ghaznawi by mentioning “an honorable scholar” at the top of a video statement released on social media.
“You encouraged the people to rebel, so what is the result?” Nadim said. “The result is that rebellion against this (ban) is allowed. If people are encouraged to rebel against the system, will it benefit Muslims?”
The minister was not immediately available for comment. But his spokesman, Hafiz Ziaullah Hashimi, confirmed Nadim’s remarks without giving further details about who they were directed at or the reason behind them.

Chinese health officials defended their search for the source of the COVID-19 virus and lashed out Saturday at the World Health Organization after its leader said Beijing should have shared genetic information earlier.
The WHO comments were “offensive and disrespectful,” said the director of the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shen Hongbing. He accused the WHO of “attempting to smear China” and said it should avoid helping others “politicize COVID-19.”
The global health body’s director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said March 17 that newly disclosed genetic material gathered in Wuhan in central China, where the first cases were detected in late 2019, “should have been shared three years ago.”
“As a responsible country and as scientists, we have always actively shared research results with scientists from around the world,” Shen said at a news conference.
The origins of COVID-19 are still debated and the focus of bitter political dispute.
Many scientists believe it jumped from animals to humans at a market in Wuhan, but the city also is home to laboratories including China’s top facility for collecting viruses. That prompted suggestions COVID-19 might have leaked from one.
The ruling Communist Party has tried to deflect criticism of its handling of the outbreak by spreading uncertainty about its origins.
Officials have repeated anti-U.S. conspiracy theories that the virus was created by Washington and smuggled into China. The government also says the virus might have entered China on mail or food shipments, though scientists abroad see no evidence to support that.
Chinese officials suppressed information about the Wuhan outbreak in 2019 and punished a doctor who warned others about the new disease. The ruling party reversed course in early 2020 and shut down access to major cities and most international travel to contain the disease.
The genetic material cited by the WHO’s Tedros was uploaded recently to a global database but collected in 2020 at a Wuhan market where wildlife was sold.
The samples show DNA from raccoon dogs mingled with the virus, scientists say. They say that adds evidence to the hypothesis COVID-19 came from animals, not a lab, but doesn’t resolve the question of where it started. They say the virus also might have spread to raccoon dogs from humans.
The information was removed by Chinese officials from the database after foreign scientists asked the CDC about it, but it had been copied by a French expert and shared with researchers outside China.
A CDC researcher, Zhou Lei, who worked in Wuhan, said Chinese scientists “shared all the data we had” and “adhered to principles of openness, objectivity and transparency.”
Shen said scientists investigated the possibility of a laboratory leak and “fully shared our research and data without any concealment or reservation.”
Shen said the source of COVID-19 had yet to be found, but he noted it took years to identify the AIDS virus and its origin still is unclear.
“Some forces and figures who instigate and participate in politicizing the traceability issue and attempting to smear China should not assume that the vision of the scientific community around the world will be blinded by their clumsy manipulation,” Shen said.

Israel launched rare strikes in southern Lebanon early Friday and pressed on with bombing targets in the Gaza Strip, marking a widening escalation in the region following violence this week at Jerusalem’s most sensitive holy site.
The cross-border fighting erupted during a time of heightened religious fervor — when Jews are celebrating the Passover holiday and Muslims are marking the Ramadan holy month. In 2021, an escalation also triggered by clashes at Jerusalem’s Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, spilled over into an 11-day war between Israel and Gaza’s Hamas rulers.
Friday’s strikes in southern Lebanon came a day after militants fired nearly three dozen rockets from there at Israel, wounding two people and causing some property damage. The Israeli military said it targeted installations of Hamas, the Palestinian militant group, in southern Lebanon.
Associated Press correspondents in the area said several missiles fired by Israeli warplanes struck an open field in the town of Qalili near the Palestinian refugee camp of Rashidiyeh, close to the coastal southern city of Tyre, while others struck a bridge and power transformer in the nearby town of Maaliya and a farm on the outskirts of Rashidiyeh, killing several sheep. No human deaths were reported.
Israeli strikes in Lebanon risk drawing Lebanon’s Hezbollah militia into the fighting, which could lead to war. The Iran-backed group, armed with thousands of rockets and missiles, holds sway over much of southern Lebanon and is viewed by Israel as a bitter foe.
The Israeli military was careful to note in its announcement about Friday’s attack that it was targeting only sites linked to Palestinian militants. In recent years, Hezbollah has stayed out of other flareups related to the Al-Aqsa Mosque, which stands on a hilltop revered by Muslims and Jews.
In Jerusalem before dawn prayers on Friday, violence erupted again at the hilltop compound as Israeli police stationed at one of the gates forcibly dispersed vast crowds of worshippers who chanted praise for Hamas while pushing their way into the limestone courtyard. Videos from the scene showed police beating large groups of Palestinian men with sticks until they stumbled backward, falling and knocking down vendors’ tables.
The head of the U.N. peacekeeping force in Lebanon, Maj. Gen. Aroldo Lázaro, said he was in contact with Israeli and Lebanese authorities early Friday. The force, known as UNIFIL, said that both sides have said they do not want war.
Meanwhile, Israeli air strikes on Gaza resumed early Friday, after militants fired more rockets from the blockaded territory, setting off air raid sirens in the Israeli coastal city of Ashkelon. The military said targets included the entry shaft to an underground network used for weapons manufacturing.
The current round of violence began Wednesday after Israeli police twice raided the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem’s Old City. That led Thursday to rocket fire from Gaza and, in a significant escalation, the rocket barrage from Lebanon.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened his Security Cabinet for a three-hour meeting late Thursday. “Israel’s response, tonight and beyond, will extract a heavy price from our enemies,” he said in a statement after the meeting.
Almost immediately, Palestinian militants in Gaza began firing rockets into southern Israel, setting off air raid sirens across the region. Loud explosions could be heard in Gaza from the Israeli strikes, as outgoing rockets whooshed into the skies toward Israel. For now, Palestinian militants have fired only short-range rockets from Gaza, rather than the long-range projectiles that can reach as far as Tel Aviv and typically invite harsher Israeli retaliation.
The Israeli military said the rocket fire on its northern and southern fronts was carried out by Palestinian militants in connection to this week’s violence at Al-Aqsa where Israeli police stormed into the building with tear gas and stun grenades to confront Palestinians barricaded inside on two straight days. The violent scenes from the mosque ratcheted up tensions across the region.
In a briefing with reporters, Lt. Col. Richard Hecht, an Israeli military spokesman, said the army drew a clear connection between the Lebanese rocket fire and the recent unrest in Jerusalem.
“It’s a Palestinian-oriented event,” he said, adding that either the Hamas or Islamic Jihad militant groups, which are based in Gaza but also operate in Lebanon, could be involved. But he said the army believed that Hezbollah and the Lebanese government were aware of what happened and also held responsibility.
The mosque — the third-holiest site in Islam — stands on a hilltop revered by Jews as the Temple Mount, the holiest site in Judaism. The competing claims to the site have repeatedly spilled over into violence over the years.
No faction in Lebanon claimed responsibility for the salvo of rockets. A Lebanese security official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to media, said the country’s security forces believed the rockets were launched by a Lebanon-based Palestinian militant group, not by Hezbollah.
Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, condemned the firing of rockets from Lebanon, adding that Lebanese troops and U.N. peacekeepers were investigating and trying to find the perpetrators. Mikati said his government “categorically rejects any military escalation” and the use of Lebanese territories to stage acts that threaten stability.
Hezbollah has condemned the Israeli police raids in Jerusalem. Both Israel and Hezbollah have avoided an all-out conflict since a 34-day war in 2006 ended in a draw.
The current escalation comes against the backdrop of Netanyahu’s domestic problems. For the past three months, hundreds of thousands of Israelis have been demonstrating against his plans to overhaul the country’s judicial system, claiming it will lead the country toward authoritarianism.
Key military units, including fighter pilots, have threatened to stop reporting for duty if the overhaul is passed, drawing a warning from Defense Minister Yoav Gallant that Israel’s national security could be harmed by the divisive plan. Netanyahu said he was firing Gallant, but then backtracked as he put the overhaul on hold for several weeks. Critics could also accuse him of trying to use the crisis to divert attention from his domestic woes.
Netanyahu said that the domestic divisions had no impact on national security and that the country would remain united in the face of external threats.
Tensions have simmered along the Lebanese border as Israel appears to have ratcheted up its shadow war against Iranian-linked targets in Syria, another close ally of Iran, Israel’s archenemy in the region.
Suspected Israeli airstrikes in Syria in recent weeks have killed two Iranian military advisers and temporarily put the country’s two largest airports out of service. Hecht, the military spokesman, said Thursday’s rocket fire was not believed to be connected to events in Syria.
In Washington, the principal deputy State Department spokesman, Vedant Patel, said, “Israel has legitimate security concerns and has every right to defend themselves.”
But he also urged calm in Jerusalem, saying that “any unilateral action that jeopardizes the status quo to us is unacceptable,” he said.
In Jerusalem, the situation remained tense at Al-Aqsa. For the previous two nights, Palestinians barricaded themselves in the mosque with stones and firecrackers.
Worshippers have been demanding the right to pray overnight inside the mosque — which authorities typically only permit during the last 10 days of the monthlong Ramadan holiday. They also have stayed in the mosque in protest over threats by religious Jews to carry out a ritual animal slaughter at the sacred site for Passover.
Israel did not try to prevent people from spending the night in the mosque early Friday — apparently because it was the weekend, when Jews do not visit the compound. But tensions could re-ignite Sunday when Jewish visits resume.
Israel bars ritual slaughter on the site, but calls by Jewish extremists to revive the practice, including offers of cash rewards to anyone who even attempts to bring an animal into the compound, have amplified fears among Muslims that Israel is plotting to take over the site
In this week’s violence, Israeli police fired stun grenades and rubber bullets to evict worshippers who had locked the doors of the building. Palestinians hurled stones and fireworks at officers. After a few hours of scuffles that left a trail of damage, police managed to drag everyone out of the compound.
Police fiercely beat Palestinians and arrested over 400 people. Israeli authorities control access to the area but the compound is administered by Islamic and Jordanian officials.
The violence at the site has resonated across the region, with condemnations pouring in from Muslim leaders.

Janata Samajwadi Party (JSP) Chairman Upendra Yadav, who lost to Janamat Party Chairman CK Raut in the House of Representatives (HoR) constituency of Saptari-2 in November 2022, may again have to suffer at the hands of Raut.
This by-election in Bara-2 will be a battle between the waning pre-eminent force in Madhes, JSP, and the rising force, Janamat Party, that hopes to one day overtake JSP as the strongest party in the plains.
Raut recognizing that his party will have to directly compete with JSP if it wishes to become a major force in Madhes ushered Shiv Chandra Kushwaha into Janamat Party from CPN (Maoist Center) to defeat Yadav in the by-election in Bara-2.
Many say JSP Chairman Yadav made his confidant Ram Sahay Prasad Yadav, who was elected from Bara-2, vice-president to contest the by-election from that constituency with a big population of Yadavs where JSP has very strong organization.
Setopati reached all the wards in the constituency, which includes three municipalities and two rural municipalities, and talked with 560 voters about the upcoming by-election, their preferred parties/candidates, the reasons for their preference, and the most important issues for them, among other things.
The constituency includes the whole of Mahagadhimai and Pachrauta municipalities; Suvarna, Devtal and Karaiyamai rural municipalities; and Ward Number 8 of Kolhabi Municipality.
Just 3,000-4,000 of around 125,000 voters in the constituency are of hill origin while the Yadavs constitute the biggest community here. The Pachpaunia community, which also includes Janamat Party candidate Kushwaha, is the second biggest community while the constituency also includes Madhesi Dalits, Tharus and Muslims.

A whopping 199 (35.5%) of the 560 voters Setopati talked to said that they would vote for Kushwaha—who had secured 13,823 votes contesting as the common coalition candidate on a Maoist ticket and lost to Ram Sahay Prasad Yadav by just 355 votes in the November election—while 161 (28.7) said that they would vote for Upendra Yadav.
Sixty-two (11%) of them said that they would vote for Ramesh Kharel of Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) while 59 (10.5%) pledged to vote for Purushottam Paudel of CPN-UML meaning the two would have a close fight for the third position.
Thirty-one (5.5%) of them said that they would vote for Arun Gyawali of Janata Party led by Prabhu Sah while 48 (8.5%) of the voters said that they had yet to decide who to vote for.
Janamat Party seems set to attract most votes from JSP in the constituency.
Fifty-eight of the 199 who pledged to vote for Kushwaha said that they had voted for JSP in November, 27 said that they had voted for CPN (Maoist Center), 18 for independent candidates, and 11 had not voted in November due to different reasons. Similarly, 16 pledged to vote for Janamat Party despite being affiliated to Nepali Congress (NC).
Ninety-four of the 161 who pledged to vote for Upendra Yadav said that they had voted for JSP also in November and 17 said that they had voted for independent candidates. Twenty-eight said that they supported NC and would vote for Yadav as he was the common coalition candidate, and nine said that they supported Maoist Center and would vote for Yadav for the same reason. Four said that they would vote for Yadav despite supporting UML while six said that they had not voted in November due to different reasons.
JSP also seems to be leaking votes to RSP that has fielded Ramesh Kharel, who had resigned from the post of DIG of Nepal Police and made a name for himself serving as SP in Parsa district in the past. Kharel himself has been campaigning as SP Kharel to capitalize on that goodwill while some voters also said they would vote for him due to RSP President Rabi Lamichhane.
Sixteen of the 62 who pledged to vote for RSP’s Kharel said that they had voted for JSP in November while six are first-time voters. Nine said they would vote for Kharel despite being NC supporters while three UML supporters also pledged to vote for him.
All the 59 voters who pledged to vote for UML candidate Paudel said they would vote for him as they support UML. This shows that it will be hard for UML, which had supported Ram Sahay Prasad Yadav in the constituency in November, to attract voters from other parties even as it looks set to leak votes to Janamat Party, RSP and even JSP.
This does not mean Upendra Yadav will definitely lose or Kushwaha will be elected as voting takes place more than a week later and voters may swing during the intervening period. But the fact that Yadav looks behind in the race in Bara-2 that remains a JSP stronghold to the party with no organization in the constituency should be a matter of grave concern for Yadav.
JSP’s Ram Sahay Prasad Yadav had not just defeated common coalition candidate Kushwaha, who was supported by NC, but JSP was also the largest party in the constituency on the basis of Proportional Representation (PR) electoral system votes securing 13,242 votes. NC was second with 11,179, followed by UML 9,193, Janamat Party 8,846, Loktantrik Samajwadi Party (LSP) 4,225 and Maoist Center 3,256.
Upendra Yadav also has the support of NC, LSP and Maoist Center as the common candidate of the ruling coalition which together secured 31,902 PR votes in November. He also has the support of Ram Kishore Yadav, who secured 11,043 votes contesting as an independent candidate after quitting JSP in Bara-2, and Rabindra Prasad Yadav, who secured 10,750 votes contesting as a rebel NC candidate.
But Upendra Yadav seems to be trailing Kushwaha despite all that. The main reason for that is that Upendra Yadav is not contesting Kushwaha but Raut, who had defeated him in Saptari, in what appears to be a rematch of that November contest.
Many of the voters Setopati talked to said that Raut and Upendra Yadav are set for a close fight despite Raut not contesting the election. Raut’s magic seems to work the most on youths, women, impoverished people and Dalits.
Aware that defeating Upendra Yadav again in Bara-2 will establish him as the most prominent leader in Madhes, Raut has been staying in Bara in recent times. He has visited all the wards in the constituency, had tea with the voters and talked with them sharing their woes and happiness.
Upendra Yadav has also been based in the constituency but the contrast between him and Raut cannot be starker. Yadav visits with a motorcade and communicating directly with the voters has never been the forte of Yadav, who can neither talk with his eyes or laugh with gay abandon. Many voters complain that he does not listen to their grievances.
Yadav also suffers from the disadvantage of trying to again become HoR member through the backdoor just five months after that resounding defeat in Saptari by engineering the election of his confidant Ram Sahay Prasad Yadav as the country’s vice-president. Many point that he should have exercised patience and waited for five years.
He has always faced the accusation of continuously changing his constituency.
Yadav—who had lost to NC’s Girija Prasad Koirala in Sunsari-5 on a UML ticket in the first parliamentary election after restoration of democracy in 1990 and later joined the Maoist party—rose as the messiah of Madhes following the Madhes Movement triggered by him torching the Interim Constitution at the Maitighar Mandala just a day after it was promulgated on January 15, 2007, as founder of a political advocacy movement named Madhesi Janadhikar Forum.
The next Madhes Movement forced Koirala to sign an agreement accepting federalism. Yadav turned his organization into a political party and emerged as the fourth largest party after Maoists, NC and UML following the First Constituent Assembly (CA) Election in 2008. He was elected to the First Constituent Assembly (CA) Election in 2008 from both Morang and Sunsari districts.
He lost from Morang and won in Sunsari in the Second CA Election in 2013. He contested from Saptari-2, which includes Mahadeva Rural Municipality where he was born, in 2017 in search of a safe seat. But he lost to Raut even in that safe constituency in the recent election.
He has now taken his caravan to Bara-2 and suffers from the same malaise that took him down in Saptari. Many voters complain that he has not done anything for the people of Madhes despite continuously becoming lawmaker and minister in the past 15 years and used politics as a means to get into the government.
The fact that Raut roped in Kushwaha from Maoist Center to defeat Upendra Yadav also seems to be working against Yadav with the Janamat Party candidate looking set to add a few votes on his own on top of all those he looks set to amass owing to the charisma and popularity of Raut.
Upendra Yadav also looks set to struggle to attract all the votes from the second largest party in the constituency, NC, despite the grand old party officially supporting him. He will have to attract as many NC votes as he can if he were to register a narrow win over Kushwaha.

CPN-UML Secretary Yogesh Bhattarai has taken exception to CPN (Unified Socialist) Chairman Madhav Kumar Nepal’s claims that the main opposition party is working for House dissolution.
Talking with reporters at the Federal Parliament Building in New Baneshwore on Wednesday Bhattarai has asked how a party in the opposition can dissolve the House.
Talking with reporters in Sunsari earlier on Wednesday Nepal, who formed the party after splitting from UML, claimed that UML wanted mid-term election after House dissolution.
“The Madhav Nepal that I know does not use unnecessary substances (sic). I know Madhav Nepal as someone who is little far from alcohol and smoking,” Bhattarai, who was in the Khanal-Nepal faction of UML but chose to remain in UML led by KP Sharma Oli instead of joining Unified Socialist formed by the Khanal-Nepal faction, has stated.
He has also called Nepal’s accusation a bit suspicious. “How can a party that is in the opposition dissolve the House? What is he saying? Is he dreaming or awake? Seeing that a person who has run a big party for 15 years and has already become prime minister, such a seasoned politician speak like this…he seems to have changed a lot in the past one and a half years.”

The government has prepared a working procedure for providing Rs 200,000 each to the then “disqualified"" Maoist combatants.
According to Binod Prakash Singh, secretary at the Home Ministry, the working procedure has already been prepared.
The Cabinet meeting on March 20 had announced the decision to distribute Rs 200,000 each to the “disqualified” Maoist combatants. The government had drawn criticism for its decision to distribute money from the state coffers to Maoist cadres who had been verified as non-combatants by UNMIN.
According to Nepali Congress Chief Whip Ramesh Lekhak, Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal had told the ruling coalition meeting on March 22 that no such decision had been taken.
Secretary Singh said that they worked accordingly after the Cabinet decision to prepare a working procedure for distributing money to the disqualified combatants.
“As per the working procedure, we will now verify with the District Administration Office concerned the names of those who are to receive the money,” Singh told Setopati. “Maybe the money distribution will begin within a month at the latest.”
According to Singh, the Home Ministry has the names of 4,008 Maoists disqualified by UNMIN. The District Administration Offices will verify whether those people are in the district or municipality concerned or not.
“There is also the organization of discharged combatants. We also have asked them for names. We will send the names provided by UNMIN to the districts concerned and verify whether they are there or not. We have also formed a committee headed by the Home Ministry’s deputy secretary to inquire further about the names sent by the districts,” Singh said. “People on the list are abroad, we will provide them money after 2-3 months.”
As per the working procedure, Rs 200,000 is to be deposited in the bank account of each disqualified combatant.
“We won’t give money to everybody at the same time, the Finance Ministry has also said that the money will be release in installments,” Singh said.

The disciplinary committee of Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) has taken lawmaker Dhaka Kumar Shrestha’s statement regarding the audio recording of a phone conversation purported to be between him and businessman Durga Prasai.
Shrestha has said in his statement that the audio recording where a person is heard demanding Rs 20 million from Prasai is not his.
Shrestha has claimed that the audio recording of the phone conversation with Prasai has been edited.
Bharat Mani Devkota, head of the disciplinary committee, said that lawmaker Shrestha was questioned about the audio recording.
“We have prepared a report based on his clarification and statement. The central committee will take further decision regarding it,” Devkota said. “He has claimed that his audio has been edited.""
Kapurbot Media on Sunday published an audio recording of what it claims is a deal of Rs 20 million between Shrestha and Prasai. Shrestha can be heard telling Prasai that the amount is needed to be given to RSP President Rabi Lamichhane’s men for Shrestha to become health minister.
The conversation took place at the start of January, as Prasai informs in the audio, when RSP was negotiating in the then ruling coalition also including CPN-UML to get the Health Ministry. Shrestha can be heard telling Prasai that Lamichhane would make him heath minister only if he hands over Rs 20-25 million to Lamichhane's men.
On Monday, Kapurbot Media released another audio recording believed to be a phone call Shrestha had made to Yadu Gautam, a member of Prasai’s team, after the first audio recording was released on Sunday. Also, a person who calls himself Shrestha’s bhai (younger brother) is heard talking to Prasai in the earlier part of the audio recording.
Shrestha was elected to the House of Representatives (HoR) through the Proportional Representation electoral system.

Audio recording of RSP lawmaker Shrestha demanding Rs20M from Durga Prasai public (With audio)
RSP lawmaker Shrestha submits clarification on audio recording

In the earlier part of the audio, a person who calls himself Shrestha’s bhai (younger brother) calls Prasai.
Shrestha’s brother tells Prasai that the party will now take action against Shrestha and that he will lose the post of lawmaker.
Prasai says it’s not Shrestha’s fault but rather of those who made him ask for money, and asks how he can help in the matter.
Shrestha’s brother then says Prasai should understand that his brother has been made a scapegoat and that he wishes to meet Prasai.
Prasai asks him to tell Shrestha to meet in the evening, saying he is attending a microfinance event in Birgunj. He also expresses displeasure at the fact that party chiefs take money for making lawmaker and also for making minister.
Kapurbot TV has also published a video of the person who calls himself Shrestha’s brother.
Kapurbot Media on Sunday published an audio recording of what it claims is a deal of Rs 20 million between Shrestha and Prasai. Shrestha can be heard telling Prasai that the amount is needed to be given to RSP President Rabi Lamichhane’s men for Shrestha to become health minister.
The conversation took place at the start of January, as Prasai informs in the audio, when RSP was negotiating in the then ruling coalition also including CPN-UML to get the Health Ministry. Shrestha can be heard telling Prasai that Lamichhane would make him heath minister only if he hands over Rs 20-25 million to Lamichhane's men.
Shrestha was elected to the House of Representatives (HoR) through the Proportional Representation electoral system.

Son of former joint general secretary of Nepali Congress (NC) Govinda Raj Joshi has put five conditions to NC President Sher Bahadur Deuba for supporting the party's candidate in Tanahu-1.
The grand old party had recently withdrawn  disciplinary action taken against Joshi before the upcoming by-election scheduled to be held on April 23.
Deuba summoned Joshi's son Deepak Raj Joshi to his residence at Dhumbarahi to solicit support for NC's candidate in Tanahu-1 Govinda Bhattarai. NC has also been trying to bring back the Joshi into the party in recent times.
Deepak Raj Joshi has put five conditions to Deuba for that. The first being respectable role for his father in the party.
NC had punished Govinda Raj Joshi in a way that he did not remain even general member for five years for engineering defeat of Ram Chandra Paudel from Tanahu-1 in 2017.
Paudel was elected to the House of Representatives (HoR) in the election held in November 2022 and has since been elected the country’s president. Joshi had contested even the recent election from Tanahu-1 and had secured 6,878 votes.
NC has fielded Bhattarai in the by-election to be held in the vacant constituency.
The second demand is 33 percent sharing of party posts in the district to the Joshi faction. The other demands being management of Kul Bahadur Gurung and others who have left the party in the past few decades.
The other demand is investigation of attack on Deepak during the local election last year and relief for him. He had contested for mayor of Vyas Municipality as an independent candidate with support of CPN-UML.

Nepali Congress (NC) General Secretary and House of Representatives (HoR) member from Kathmandu-4 Gagan Thapa has urged Prime Minister (PM) Pushpa Kamal Dahal to hold dialogue with Mayor of Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) Balen Shah on the issue of stopping collection of garbage from the Singha Durbar.
Taking to Facebook a day after he unilaterally stopped collection of garbage from the Singha Durbar, Shah on Monday blamed the federal government for lack of coordination with the local government despite his continuous efforts for nine months. “The conclusion until now of the disregard, irresponsibility and negligence toward the repeated efforts made is the decision to not collect garbage from the Singha Durbar,” Shah posted.
Speaking during the HoR meeting on Monday ruling lawmaker Thapa conceded that there seemed to be lack of coordination among the federal, provincial and local governments. “Clash between the Bag Durbar (the office of KMC) and the Singha Durbar has been seen. We can debate later about the style and language used by a people’s representative to get the demands fulfilled complaining about lack of hearing. But let there be immediate dialogue with KMC to resolve the problem seen now,” Thapa stated.
He added that the lack of coordination is not only with KMC and pointed that chiefs of many local bodies were currently making rounds of the Singha Durbar seeking or stopping transfer of local body staffers. “The federal government should be proactive for coordination among the three levels of government. But that has not happened.”
Mayor Shah listed how the efforts he made to coordinate with 14 different federal ministries to resolve problems including management of squatters, traffic lights, footpath encroached by diplomatic missions, hospitals, expansion of the Ring Road, street lights and others had failed to yield results due to apathy of the federal government.
He had taken to the Facebook on Saturday even to announce stopping collection of garbage from the Singha Durbar taking everyone including Deputy Mayor Sunita Dangol by surprise.
Garbage was not collected even from the residence of the president, the prime minister and the federal ministers on Sunday.

Rastriya Swatantra Party President Rabi Lamichhane has said that there’s a deep reason behind why his party has continued to support the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government.
Addressing an event on Friday, Lamichhane said that their continued support to the Dahal government holds legal significance as they had submitted signatures to the President’s Office for making Dahal prime minister.
“It won’t take us even a second to withdraw support, but that has a legal basis, that has a legal route,” Lamichhane said. “That has a deep reason. We are signatories who went to the president to make Dahal prime minister. Therefore, it has legal significance.”
He, however, did not reveal what the legal significance is.
Lamichhane is contesting the April 23 by-election in the House of Representatives constituency of Chitwan-2. The Chitwan-2 seat has fallen vacant since the Supreme Court ruled that Lamichhane was ineligible to become a lawmaker.

Jha also questioned why the issues regarding minimum wage of workers and issuing national ID card to all citizens within a year were not included in the program.
He asked why issues mentioned in RSP’s commitment paper cannot be included now when they had been included before. “We want clarity if the opinion and behavior regarding our political existence is changing,” Jha said.

A circular issued by the Department of National Id and Civil Registration under the Home Ministry on Wednesday has been widely criticized for snubbing the rights of a woman once again.
The circular for implementation down to the ward level prescribes that the surname of the maternal side (instead of the mother’s) be assigned to the child while registering the birth at the current address of the mother if the child is born before marriage but the child’s father is not identified, and the mother has married since and is staying with her husband along with the child.
It similarly prescribes that the surname of the maternal side be assigned to the child while registering the birth at the address of the maternal side if the child is born before marriage but the child’s father is not identified, and the mother has married since and is staying with her husband but the child is staying with her parents.
The circular further prescribes that the birth registered as per the two provisions be revoked and the birth again registered at the current address of the father with the surname of the father if the identity of the child’s father is later revealed.
The department argues that the provision of using the surname of maternal side has been kept to address the problems faced by children of a single mother but the circular has been widely condemned claiming that the circular has intentionally snubbed the mothers.  
“Our intention was not to belittle anyone. We don’t feel that a woman is a nobody. We only aimed to provide identity to the child,” Director of the department Nava Raj Jaishi told Setopati when asked whether giving the surname of the mother at the time of the child’s birth does not mean the same thing and would not have served the purpose. “Many comments have been made after the circular was issued. We will correct language of the circular if needed and there are demands to change that.”  
The circular has humiliatingly snubbed mothers despite the previous circular issued by the Home Ministry on October 24, 2022 clearly specifying to give the surname of the mother. The new circular mentions that the new one had to be issued as the local bodies and staffers complained that the previous circular was not clear.

The Home Ministry has increased surveillance of activities of medical entrepreneur Durga Prasai.
Prasai—who has recently started a campaign to save nation, nationalism, religion, culture, and citizens—has also been organizing different programs accusing banks and financial institutions of excesses.
“We have been observing activities of Durga Prasai. All the bodies routinely carry out political and economic analysis and not just observe him. We will bring to book of there is obstruction in public service, and citizens are hassled,” Information Officer with the Home Ministry Dil Kumar Tamang told Setopati.
The Prasai-led campaign has started the campaign of smearing soot on staffers of banks and financial institutions for their ‘excesses’ from Chitwan. Coordinator of the campaign Shambhu Thapa was arrested by Chitwan Police Wednesday morning for vitiating public environment by spreading rumors in the society through unnatural and demeaning remarks.
Thapa, former Chitwan chief of the Maoist youth wing Young Communist League (YCL), is under investigation and the police will decide on the type of case to be filed against him after investigation.
Different organizations of commercial and development banks, and financial and micro-finance institutions had handed over memorandum letter to the Home Ministry demanding security guarantee after Prasai started the campaign of smearing soot. The Home Ministry on March 3 then instructed all 77 district police offices to provide security to staffers of banks and financial institutions, and stop such incidents of misbehavior.
“Those violating laws, taking the laws into hands and carrying out prohibited activities in the name of campaign will be arrested. They won’t be arrested for merely joining the campaign though,” Tamang stated.
He said Thapa may have been arrested as per the Home Ministry’s instruction, and added that case can be filed against Thapa by the police itself if there are no complaints against him.
Prasai, who is close to CPN-UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli who has nominated him as central member of the party, was expelled from the party on February 25 after he started a political campaign along with former king Gyanendra Shah and his son Paras on February 13.

Flight crew of the De Havilland Canada DHC-8 (DHC-8, Q400) plane, manufactured by Bombardier and commonly known as the Dash 8, that took off from the TIA with 78 passengers onboard made the decision to fly back to the TIA shortly after the takeoff following a warning from the aircraft’s fire detection system of a possible fire in the plane’s right engine.

The Home Ministry has increased surveillance of activities of medical entrepreneur Durga Prasai.
Prasai—who has recently started a campaign to save nation, nationalism, religion, culture, and citizens—has also been organizing different programs accusing banks and financial institutions of excesses.
“We have been observing activities of Durga Prasai. All the bodies routinely carry out political and economic analysis and not just observe him. We will bring to book of there is obstruction in public service, and citizens are hassled,” Information Officer with the Home Ministry Dil Kumar Tamang told Setopati.
The Prasai-led campaign has started the campaign of smearing soot on staffers of banks and financial institutions for their ‘excesses’ from Chitwan. Coordinator of the campaign Shambhu Thapa was arrested by Chitwan Police Wednesday morning for vitiating public environment by spreading rumors in the society through unnatural and demeaning remarks.
Thapa, former Chitwan chief of the Maoist youth wing Young Communist League (YCL), is under investigation and the police will decide on the type of case to be filed against him after investigation.
Different organizations of commercial and development banks, and financial and micro-finance institutions had handed over memorandum letter to the Home Ministry demanding security guarantee after Prasai started the campaign of smearing soot. The Home Ministry on March 3 then instructed all 77 district police offices to provide security to staffers of banks and financial institutions, and stop such incidents of misbehavior.
“Those violating laws, taking the laws into hands and carrying out prohibited activities in the name of campaign will be arrested. They won’t be arrested for merely joining the campaign though,” Tamang stated.
He said Thapa may have been arrested as per the Home Ministry’s instruction, and added that case can be filed against Thapa by the police itself if there are no complaints against him.
Prasai, who is close to CPN-UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli who has nominated him as central member of the party, was expelled from the party on February 25 after he started a political campaign along with former king Gyanendra Shah and his son Paras on February 13.

The Supreme Court (SC) has changed the grounds on which it allowed rape-accused cricketer Sandeep Lamichhane to fly to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to play cricket after its order was widely slammed.
The joint bench of Justices Sapana Pradhan Malla and Kumar Chudal after conducting a joint hearing of the petition by Lamichhane, who was released on bail in the case of raping a minor, demanding he be allowed to fly to the UAE along with the Nepali national cricket team and the appeal by the Office of the Attorney General (OAG) against the Patan High Court’s order to release him on a bail of Rs 2 million, had ordered on February 27 to allow Lamichhane to go to the UAE.
The grounds for allowing him to go to the UAE that SC Spokesperson Bimal Paudel gave while reading the order, however, were changed when the order was given to the parties of the case the next day.  
Paudel had said that the main grounds for allowing Lamichhane to go to the UAE were that no semen was found in the minor’s body, and her roommate’s statement. The order forwarded to the parties the next day, however, mentions that there was no situation to send Lamichhane to judicial custody on the basis of closed-circuit television (CCTV) footage, the health check report of the victim, and Lamichhane’s statement, according to a source.
“The order forwarded to the parties also mentions that it would be inappropriate to stop the defendant from going abroad as he is a national/international player. The order read by the spokesperson mentioned the statement of the victim’s roommate and lack of semen in the victim’s body on the basis of health report as the grounds for not keeping the defendant in custody. Those grounds have now been removed.”
The order given to the parties also mentions the victim’s age, which was not mentioned by Spokesperson Paudel, pointing that there seems to be a dispute as to whether the victim is a minor or not as the defendant claims that she is 19 and not 17 as claimed by her, and adds that the Kathmandu District Court should rule on the issue.   
Paudel had said that the case should be fast-tracked as Lamichhane is an international player but the order forwarded to the parties says it should be fast-tracked as it is related to offense about gender violence.
The order given to the parties also includes a new issue. “The District Court has been ordered to provide relief through the interim relief fund as legal professionals of the victim have told the bench that her mental state is not right,” the source added.
Spokesperson Paudel told Setopati that he had only read the draft order not signed by the justices on Monday as there was a hurry. “The order given after the justices finalize and sign on it is official,” Paudel has pointed. “The main part of that order is partial revocation of the Patan High Court’s order and allowing Lamichhane to go abroad to play cricket which has not been changed even now. The grounds also are the same. But there may have been some minor changes in the explanation from the draft order.”
The SC on February 27 also ordered that Lamichhane should produce himself before the Kathmandu District Court within 15 days of completion of any tournament featuring Nepal abroad. The permission to go abroad to play cricket will be revoked if he fails to do so.
It also refused to revoke the bail granted by the Patan High Court.
Hearing on the case could not be completed on February 26 and it continued the next day.
The SC on February 24  had refused to allow Lamichhane to fly to the UAE the next day along with the Nepali national cricket team.
The Patan High Court while granting Lamichhane bail had put five conditions including prohibiting him from going abroad. Lamichhane had moved the SC demanding he be allowed to travel with the national team going to the UAE to play ICC Men's Cricket World Cup League 2 matches against the UAE and Papua New Guinea.
The bench of Justice Ishwar Khatiwada hearing Lamichhane’s petition on February 24 asked the SC administration to schedule a combined hearing of the petition and the appeal by the OAG against the Patan High Court’s order to release Lamichhane on a bail of Rs 2 million.
The joint bench of Judges Dhruba Raj Nanda and Ramesh Dhakal hearing on the appeal against the Kathmandu District Court’s order to send Lamichhane to judicial custody in the case of raping a minor on January 12 decided to revoke the Kathmandu District Court’s order citing lack of grounds to keep him in custody. He was released on a bail of Rs 2 million the next day.
The OAG in its appeal has argued that the Patan High Court’s order to release Lamichhane on bail is against legal provisions and the SC’s interpretation during bail hearing in cases of similar nature.
Clause 27 of the National Criminal Procedure (Code) Act, 2017 has clear provision for holding the accused of any offense which is punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding three years in detention if based on the evidence available the accused appears to be guilty of the offense or there is any reasonable ground, based on such evidence, to believe that such person is guilty of the offense.
But Lamichhane was released on bail despite sub-section 3 (d) of Section 219 of the National Penal (Code) Act, 2017 stating that a person who commits rape shall be liable to imprisonment for a term of 10 to 12 years if the woman is 16 or above 16 years of age but below 18 years of age. The victim in the case is 17 years.
The Patan High Court ordered Lamichhane’s release on five conditions. He was to be sent back to prison if found to have violated those conditions.
The court had prohibited Lamichhane from traveling abroad. He was also required to obtain permission from the District Police Range Kathmandu for leaving the Kathmandu Valley.
The court had also asked the police to monitor his activities.
Lamichhane’s lawyers had appealed against the Kathmandu District Court’s order on November 4 to send him to judicial custody until the case is decided. Lamichhane had been kept at the Central Jail Jagannath Dewal.
The Patan High Court earlier had ordered documents from hospital where the victim was born to ascertain her actual age after Lamichhane's defense alleged that she was not actually a minor.
The District Government Attorney’s Office (DGAO), Kathmandu had registered a case against Lamichhane charging him with raping a minor.
The District Police Range, Kathmandu and the Metropolitan Police Circle, Gaushala had submitted the investigation report at the DGAO on October 21 after completing their joint investigation against Lamichhane. However, a case could not be filed against him then due to the Tihar holidays.
Police had investigated against Lamichhane under Section 219 of the National Penal (Code) Act, 2017 after a 17-year-old girl filed a rape complaint against him.
The Kathmandu DGAO has demanded a prison sentence of up to 12 years against Lamichhane as per sub-section 3 (d) of Section 219, which states that a person who commits rape shall be liable to imprisonment for a term of 10 to 12 years if the woman is 16 or above 16 years of age but below 18 years of age. It has also sought compensation for the victim.
Lamichhane has denied the rape allegation in his statements to the DGAO and police. He has admitted to staying with the girl in the same room of a hotel in Kathmandu on August 21. But he has said that the girl had slept on the bed and he had slept on a chair that night.
Lamichhane, who is the former captain of the Nepal cricket team, has been accused of raping a minor multiple times in a hotel room in Kathmandu on August 21.
A 17-year-old girl filed a rape complaint against Lamichhane at the Gaushala Police Circle on September 6.
The girl has complained that Lamichhane took her out to different places of Bhaktapur and Kathmandu on August 21, a day before Lamichhane left for the bilateral series with Kenya.
She has accused Lamichhane of raping her multiple times in room number 305 of a hotel in Kathmandu Metropolitan City Ward Number 9 that night.
Police have also collected CCTV footage of the night from the hotel. The footage shows that Lamichhane had stayed at the hotel for seven hours.
The girl has claimed in her complaint that she had gone to Nagarkot with Lamichhane on August 17 after being introduced to him through a friend.
Lamichhane left to play in the Caribbean Premier League on August 22 after leading the team to a 3-2 victory in the five-match Twenty20 series against Kenya. Rohit Kumar Paudel then led the Nepali team in the one-dayers in his absence.
An arrest warrant was issued against Lamichhane on September 8 and the Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) suspended him from the national team the same day after issuance of the arrest warrant.
Nepal Police later also issued a diffusion notice against him through Interpol on September 26.
Section 219 (2) of the National Penal (Code) Act, 2017 states: “Where a man has sexual intercourse with a woman without her consent or with a girl child below eighteen years of age even with her consent, the man shall be considered to commit rape on such woman or girl child.”

The Pokhara High Court has acquitted actor Paul Shah of rape charge.
Senior advocate Kamal Mohan Wagle, Shah’s lawyer, told Setopati that Shah will be released from Tanahun District Prison on Monday following his acquittal on Sunday.
After a hearing on appeals filed by the District Government Attorney’s Office and Shah against the Nawalpur District Court’s order in the minor rape case, the High Court acquitted Shah citing insufficient evidence to prove the charge.
A single bench of Nawalpur District Court Judge Yagya Prasad Acharya had acquitted Shah of rape charge on September 6, 2022 but sentenced him to two and a half years in prison and fined him Rs 25,000 for child sexual abuse and also ordered him to pay Rs 1 million in reparation to the victim.
The District Government Attorney’s Office and Shah had appealed at the Pokhara High Court against the decision.
The Tanahun District Court had also acquitted Shah of rape charge on January 17.
A single bench of Judge Komal Prasad Acharya had acquitted Shah of the rape charge stating that the accusation could not be proved.
A rape complaint was filed against Shah by a then 17-year-old singer with the District Police Office, Tanahun on February 23, 2022. He surrendered before the Tanahun Police four days later. The family had also lodged another complaint with the Nawalpur Police on February 27. The minor's family had lodged the rape complaints alleging that Shah raped her in Pokhara, Tanahun and Nawalpur.
Shah was accused by the singer, who is a minor and cannot legally give consent for sex, of having sex with her promising to marry her in the future.
The singer had reached the Kaski Police complaining that Shah had sexually abused her a month before that. Shah seems to have tried to reach a settlement after the Kaski Police refused to register the complaint citing lack of jurisdiction and advised the girl to go to the Tanahun Police instead as the alleged incident happened in Tanahun.
The Tanahun District Court had then sent Shah to judicial custody on March 24 after he conceded that he had reached her room at midnight after getting drunk despite denying that he raped her.
The minor then had turned hostile and claimed in her statement to the Tanahun District Court that Shah did not rape her.

Police have also collected CCTV footage of the night from the hotel. The footage shows that Lamichhane had stayed at the hotel for seven hours.
The girl has claimed in her complaint that she had gone to Nagarkot with Lamichhane on August 17 after being introduced to him through a friend.
Lamichhane left to play in the Caribbean Premier League on August 22 after leading the team to a 3-2 victory in the five-match Twenty20 series against Kenya. Rohit Kumar Paudel then led the Nepali team in the one-dayers in his absence.
An arrest warrant was issued against Lamichhane on September 8 and the Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) suspended him from the national team the same day after issuance of the arrest warrant.
Nepal Police later also issued a diffusion notice against him through Interpol on September 26.
Section 219 (2) of the National Penal (Code) Act, 2017 states: “Where a man has sexual intercourse with a woman without her consent or with a girl child below eighteen years of age even with her consent, the man shall be considered to commit rape on such woman or girl child.”

Transport workers have withdrawn public transportation strike in the Kathmandu Valley after dialogue with the government on Tuesday.
They agreed to end transportation strike after Minister for Physical Infrastructure and Transport Narayan Kaji Shrestha expressed commitment to resolve the problems in the transport sector forming a task force, according to chair of Nepal Independent Transport Workers Organization Bhim Jwala Rai.
""We have already formed the task force to resolve all the problems from one place. We will gradually address the issues of fine and suspension of driving license that you have raised now,"" Shrestha told the transport workers during the dialogue and urged them to end the strike.
The transport workers and entrepreneurs then agreed to end the strike but said they would continue other peaceful protest programs.  
The transport workers said that they had to resort to strike due to the misbehavior by traffic police inside the Kathmandu Valley.
Public transportation vehicles did not operate in the Valley since early Tuesday morning due to the strike resulting in problems for the commoners.

Transport workers have said that they will not operate public transportation in the Kathmandu Valley from Tuesday.
Agitating transport workers made such an announcement issuing a statement on Monday evening.
According to Bhim Jwala Rai, chair of Nepal Transport Free Workers Organization, transport workers have taken to the streets in protest against the thuggery by New Buspark contractor Lhotse Multipurpose Private Limited. They have blocked traffic in Balaju by parking their vehicles across the road.
Rai said three transport workers’ associations held a joint agitation but they were physically assaulted during that period.
He said they had 10 demands which they had planned to make public but they launched the protest after a group of about 30 people including the company’s general manager Sunil Kunwar and members Pankaj Malla and Himal Kunwar physically assaulted them.
The transport workers had warned of halting transportation, accusing traffic police of high-handedness including imposing fines against the law and suspending drivers’ licenses.
They have said that their demands should be addressed immediately. They have also said that their agitation will continue until a high-level task force is formed and starts work to address policy-level issues including law amendment.

                            Daniel Radcliffe has said he had started drinking to cope up with the feeling that he was ""being watched"" by Harry Potter fans.

The actor, who found global fame after he played the title character in eight ""Harry Potter"" movies, made the revelation during ""The Off Camera Show"".

""In my case, the quickest way of forgetting about the fact that you were being watched was to get very drunk,"" he said.

""Then as you get very drunk, you become aware that, 'Oh, people are watching more now because now I'm getting very drunk, so I should probably drink more to ignore that more',"" he added.

He also said that ""there is no blueprint"" to deal with the pressures of ""starting young"".

""That's like when people have a go at Justin Bieber and drag racing cars. I'm like, yeah, but stuff could be super crazy for him right now,"" he added.

It took the actor ""a few years and a couple of attempts"" to quit alcohol. He said he has been sober since 2010.

""Ultimately, it was my own decision. Like I woke up one morning after a night going like, 'This is probably not good',"" Radcliffe said.

""Even at the lowest point, I still loved my job so much. I loved going to set, and there was never a day where my own (feelings) would affect how I was on set, there was never a point where I was like, 'Oh, I wish this hadn't happened to me, I wish I wasn't Harry Potter,"" he added.

                            Actor Kangana Ranaut will soon bring her own life story to the big screen as a director and says the project won't be a ""propaganda"".

With a script penned by ""Baahubali"" writer KV Vijayendra, who also wrote ""Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi"", the film will go on floors by the end of this year in October-November.

""My own story is the subject of my next directorial. But it is not a propaganda film with characters who are starkly black and white, rather it is a sincere, heartfelt account of my journey so far with plenty of lighter moments,"" Kangana said in a statement.

""I'm emboldened by the love of the people around me, who have never judged me but accepted me for who I am,"" she added.

According to the actor, Vijayendra ""urged"" Kangana, around 12 weeks ago, to let him write a film based on her life.

""I was nervous and wary initially, but then, given his stature and the fact that I trust him implicitly, I gave Vijayendra sir the go-ahead on the project.""

Kangana said the film will focus on various aspects of her life but would not name people who have had differences with her in the past.

""How can I show my journey without people, I can't be walking alone. But we will not be taking any names. The idea is to protect me and my life with all its highs and lows.

""In the end, it is the story of an achiever, a girl from the mountains who came into Bollywood without any connections in the industry or even a godfather, and went on to carve a niche for herself against all odds,"" she added.

                            Actor Kangana Ranaut on Thursday said people from the Hindi film industry have ganged up against her for calling them out on ""nepotism"".

The actor, who was at an event of her latest ""Manikarnika"", was asked about the lack of support to her during the film's promotions.

""How will it benefit me? I've already won 3-4 national awards. At the age of 31, I am a filmmaker. Khud ko he promote kar le bohot badi baat hai (it would be a big deal if they can promote themselves).

""Is Rani of Jhansi my aunt? She's as much mine as she's yours. Then why are these people scared? They are worried just because I spoke on nepotism? They have formed a gang: 'Why did she speak on nepotism?""

The actor had sparked a debate on nepotism when she appeared on Karan Johar's chat show two years ago and started a war of words with the filmmaker after she called him the ""torchbearer of nepotism"" in the industry for launching star kids.

""They have all gathered together, like a classroom where 59 have ganged up against one, trying to bully one. How will you feel if someone did that? Aren't they ashamed? Some of them are my grandfather's age.

""They are after me. Don't they feel ashamed that it's not about me. I don't even want to work with them and I've said that often,"" she said.

The actor said ""Manikarnika"" was for the next generation and the film wasn't about Kangana.

""What Bollywood is doing, the planning and plotting, one thing is for sure, earlier I used to call them out for sexism, nepotism or pay disparity, but now I'll be after them. 'Inki vaat laga dugi'. I'll expose each and every one. They have asked for trouble by ganging up against me,"" she added.

                            The red carpet for the premiere of Liam Neeson’s latest film was canceled Tuesday, a day after a British newspaper published an interview in which the actor discussed wanting to kill a random black person nearly 40 years ago when a close friend told him she had been raped by a black man.

Organizers of the New York premiere of “Cold Pursuit” said they were cancelling interviews and photo opportunities for the film hours after Neeson appeared on “Good Morning America” to explain his past racist thoughts. He told interviewer Robin Roberts he is not a racist and moved past his desire for violence after seeking help from a priest and from friends.

Neeson said in an interview published Monday by The Independent that after learning his friend’s attacker was black, he “went up and down areas with a cosh (stick or truncheon)” hoping a black person “would come out of a pub and have a go at me about something, you know? So that I could kill him.”

“It took me a week, maybe a week and a half, to go through that,” Neeson said.

Neeson told Roberts he had asked about the race of the attacker, along with other descriptive characteristics. He said Tuesday the topic came up because the interviewer asked him about how he tapped into the feelings of revenge that he displays in “Cold Pursuit,” which tells the story of a father who seeks violent revenge for his son’s death.

“We all pretend we’re kind of politically correct,” Neeson, who grew up in Northern Ireland, told Roberts. “I mean, in this country, it’s the same in my own country too, you sometimes just scratch the surface and you discover this racism and bigotry, and it’s there.”

                            A man who broke into Taylor Swift’s townhouse in New York City and took a nap has been sentenced to six month in jail.

The New York Post’s Page Six reports that 22-year-old Roger Alvarado, of Homestead, Florida, was sentenced Tuesday after pleading guilty to criminal contempt and attempted burglary.

The Post says Alvarado plans to return to Florida after his jail stint, which is nearly finished, and serve five years’ probation. He must also complete a mental-health program.

Officers found Alvarado asleep in the pop star’s home in the Tribeca neighborhood of Manhattan in April. Police say he had also used her shower. Swift was not home during the break-in.

Alvarado had been arrested at the same address last February on charges of breaking the front door with a shovel.

                            Two years ago he made the whole world dance with “Despacito,” but Luis Fonsi says he is still a romantic singer and is ready to show “all his cards” Friday with his new album, “Vida.”

“Many people thought I moved away from that romantic side and I always said ‘I haven’t, I’m not going anywhere.’ I am still a romantic singer, I still talk that romantic language. But at the same time I like to do both things. I don’t like to be limited,” Fonsi said in a recent interview with The Associated Press, in Spanish.

“Vida” is his ninth studio album and his first in five years, a time of big changes in his life and his career — especially since 2016, when the birth of his son Rocco overlapped with that of the song that gave him international stardom and a broader exposure to Latin music. The original “Despacito” video, featuring Daddy Yankee, is still the most watched in the history of YouTube with over 5.9 billion views to date; its remix with Justin Bieber remains among the top three songs on Billboard’s list of Hot Latin Songs.

Both versions are included in the album, along with the previously-released singles “Echame la culpa” with Demi Lovato, “Calypso” with Stefflon Don, “Imposible” with Ozuna and “Sola”. It also includes new romantic songs and one powerful torch song that challenged Fonsi’s vocal chords. One of the most personal pieces is “Ahi estas tu,” which he wrote to his son Rocco. (His previous album, “8,” included a tune for his daugher Mikaela.)

There are 15 songs total that cover or fuse Latin pop, R&B, dembow, reggaeton and other genres.

“I want to be able to dance, make people rejoice, and sometimes sing a ballad with a lot of lyric, a lot of emotion,” said the Puerto Rican singer-songwriter.

The touching R&B-infused, piano-led ballad “Dime que no te irás” is also, according to Fonsi, the most difficult to perform vocally.

It “is one of the songs with more weight in this album”, he said. “It’s one of those songs that may not have the commercial value of others, but it does have the musical and emotional value.”

He also highlighted his latest single, “Sola,” a ballad that you may not hear in a club but that will make you nod to its beat.

“It’s neither the typical depressing ballad nor a rhythmic pop song and much less a reggaeton, but it’s a hybrid of the new sound of pop and that is something that I’ve always liked to do — to innovate, to suggest new things to my audience and always to follow my own path.”

In regards to the title “Vida,” he said he chose it because the album is kind of an X-ray of his life.

“These songs come from very honest, real places. Many have to do with me, many don’t. But I felt that my life is there, in each song,” said Fonsi, remembering himself running between the studio to his house to other professional commitments while his wife was pregnant, Rocco was born and starting to grow. “That life, that excitement, that love that you feel as a father for a child, the most pure and intense form of love — it’s impossible not to reflect that in my music, in the way I communicate. ‘Vida’ is all that. It’s my life.”

                            Chris Brown is free to leave France after being released from police custody.

The ‘Yeah 3x’ singer and two other men, including his bodyguard, were arrested in Paris on Monday (21.01.19) after a 24-year-old woman made an allegation of rape and though he’s been given the all-clear to return to the US, the investigation is not over.

The prosecutor’s office told TMZ: “The investigations, which are not closed at this stage, will continue under the authority of the Paris prosecutor’s office.”

The prosecutors confirmed the 29-year-old star is free to leave France, having been released from custody on his own recognisance, without bail.

The two other men who were arrested have also been let go.

The official announcement comes after Chris took to Instagram to protest his innocence against the allegations.

The ‘Loyal’ hitmaker - who has four-year-old daughter Royalty from a past relationship - shared a photo on Instagram which read “This B!tch Lyin’ ” and added the caption: “I WANNA MAKE IT PERFECTLY CLEAR...... THIS IS FALSE AND A WHOLE LOT OF CAP!

“NNNNNNNNEEEEEEEEEEVVVVVVVVVVEEEEEERRRRRR!!!!!! FOR MY DAUGHTER AND MY FAMILY THIS IS SO DISPRESPECTFUL AND IS AGAINST MY CHARACTER AND MORALS!!!!!(sic)”

The alleged victim has claimed she was attacked in Chris’ suite at the five star Mandarin Oriental hotel on January 15.

In her police statement, which was obtained by French magazine Closer, she claims she met the singer - who has been accompanied on his France trip by girlfriend Ammika Harris - at Le Crystal club, near Les Champs-Elysees, and went him back to the hotel, after she and a friend were both invited there by the ‘Run It’ hitmaker and the other two men.

She then claims she was separated from her friend and ended up alone with the singer, which is when the alleged crime took place.

According to reports, Chris and the other three men were arrested at his hotel and have been co-operating with their lawyers.

                            U.S. singer Chris Brown and two other people are in custody in Paris after a woman filed a rape complaint, French officials said Tuesday.

Brown was detained Monday on potential charges of aggravated rape and drug infractions and remained in custody Tuesday, a judicial official said. Investigators have another two days to decide whether to let him go or file preliminary charges.

Brown’s publicists at Sony Music would not immediately comment on the complaint or say what Brown, 29, was doing in Paris.

Brown has been in repeated legal trouble since pleading guilty to the felony assault in 2009 of his then-girlfriend, Rihanna. He completed his probation in that case in 2015.

One of Brown’s bodyguards is among the others detained, according to a Paris police official.

The woman who filed the complaint said she met Brown and his friends at the club Le Crystal in the 17th arrondissement of northwestern Paris on Wednesday, and then they all went to the Mandarin Oriental Hotel near the Concorde Plaza in central Paris, according to the official.

Neither official was authorized to be publicly named discussing the investigation.

Davenport was convicted of first-degree manslaughter in May.

Hines was an aspiring actress and played a small role in the movie “5 Flights Up” along with Freeman and Diane Keaton.

Freeman said in a statement after her death that “the world will never know her artistry and talent.”

His publicist previously said that while Hines was Freeman’s step-granddaughter, he referred to her as his granddaughter.

                            The Philippines’ Catriona Gray was named Miss Universe 2018 in a competition concluding Monday in Bangkok, besting contestants from 93 other countries and delighting her home nation.

Gray wore a sparkling red dress she said was inspired by a volcano in the Philippines as she was handed the crown to the delight of a roaring crowd that generally favored Southeast Asian contestants.

The 24-year-old singer and model said she wore red because “when I was 13 my mom said she had a dream that I would win Miss Universe in a red dress.” She said her mom cried when they saw each other after she won the competition, the 67th Miss Universe pageant.

Gray edged out first runner-up Tamaryn Green of South Africa and third-place Sthefany Gutierrez of Venezuela. She succeeds Demi-Leigh Nel-Peters of South Africa.

In the Philippines, pageants are a popular attraction, and Gray’s countrymen watching the televised contest cheered wildly and jumped for joy when she was declared the winner.

Celebrations were especially buoyant in Oas town in the northeastern province of Albay, from which Gray’s Filipina mother hails. According to Gray, her gown’s design, with its lava color and appearance, was influenced by Albay’s iconic Mayon Volcano.

Gray’s father is Australian, and she was born and grew up in Cairns, Australia. She studied at the Berklee College of Music in Boston in the United States.

The office of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was quick to congratulate the winner. Gray is the fourth Filipina to be named Miss Universe.

“Ms. Gray truly made the entire Philippines proud when she sashayed on the global stage and showcased the genuine qualities defining a Filipina beauty: confidence, grace, intelligence and strength in the face of tough challenges,” he said in a statement from the presidential palace. “In her success, Miss Philippines has shown to the world that women in our country have the ability to turn dreams into reality through passion, diligence, determination and hard work.”

An early round of questioning touched on the issue of drugs, a controversial issue in the Philippines where Duterte’s aggressive ‘war on drugs’ has taken thousands of lives, many in what critics charge were extrajudicial executions. Duterte raised even more controversy when he recently joked that he smoked marijuana to deal with his busy schedule of meetings with other Asian leaders at a regional summit.

Asked what she thought about legalizing marijuana, Gray said: “I’m for it being used for medical use, but not so for recreational use. Because I think if people will argue, then what about alcohol and cigarettes? Everything is good but in moderation.”

This year’s Miss Universe competition included the first-ever transgender contestant, Angela Ponce of Spain. She said in a video presentation that it was not important for her to win but was more important for her “to be here.”

One of the few controversies of this year’s contest involved Miss United States, Sarah Rose Summers, seeming to mock contestants from Cambodia and Vietnam over their English language skills. Summers apologized.

The finale was again hosted by Steve Harvey who infamously announced the wrong winner in the 2015 contest. Harvey joked briefly about the incident in exchanges with contestants and said: “You all can’t let that go” and “I’m still here.”

The theme of this year’s pageant was “Empowered Women” and was judged by seven women including former pageant winners, businesswomen and a fashion designer.

He also promised her a job in a Bollywood movie, it said.

The 'Subah Ho Na De' hitmaker was last seen on stage at a Bollywood awards ceremony followed by a performance at a private party.


Singh has sought consular access and the embassy staff is working on his case, Indian Ambassador to the UAE Navdeep Singh Suri was quoted as saying in the report.

This is not the first time that the singer has been facing charges of inappropriate behavior.


He has been accused of forcibly kissing the Bollywood's controversial actress Rakhi Sawant.

Meanwhile, official sources in New Delhi said that Singh was detained at 3 AM and legal proceedings were being initiated against him.

Pelé was simply “The King.” He embraced “the beautiful game” of soccer in his 1958 World Cup debut for Brazil and never really let go.
He won a record three World Cups and was widely regarded as one of his sport’s greatest players. His majestic and galvanizing presence set him among the most recognizable figures in the world.
Pelé died Thursday at 82. He had undergone treatment for colon cancer since 2021.
Pelé was among the game’s most prolific scorers and spent nearly two decades enchanting fans and dazzling opponents. His grace, athleticism and moves on soccer’s highest stage transfixed all. He orchestrated a fast, fluid style of play that revolutionized the sport — a flair that personified Brazilian elegance on the field.
He carried his country to soccer’s heights and became a global ambassador for his sport in a journey that began on the streets of Sao Paulo state, where he would kick a sock stuffed with newspapers or rags.
“Pelé changed everything. He transformed football into art, entertainment,” Neymar, a fellow Brazilian soccer player, said on Instagram. “Football and Brazil elevated their standing thanks to the King! He is gone, but his magic will endure. Pelé is eternal!”
In the conversation about soccer’s greatest player, only the late Diego Maradona, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are mentioned alongside him.
Different sources, counting different sets of games, list Pelé’s goal totals anywhere between 650 (league matches) to 1,281 (all senior matches, some against low-level competition). When Maradona once interviewed Pelé, he playfully asked the Brazilian how he accumulated so many goals.
The player who would be dubbed “The King” was introduced to the world at 17 at the 1958 World Cup in Sweden, the youngest player ever at the tournament.
Pelé was the emblem of his country’s World Cup triumph of 1970 in Mexico. He scored in the final and set up Carlos Alberto with a nonchalant pass for the last goal in a 4-1 victory over Italy.
The image of Pelé in a bright-yellow Brazil jersey, with the No. 10 stamped on the back, remains alive with soccer fans everywhere. As does his trademark goal celebration — a leap with a right fist thrust high above his head.
Pelé’s fame was such that in 1967 factions of a civil war in Nigeria agreed to a brief cease-fire so he could play an exhibition match in the country. He was knighted by Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II in 1997. When Pelé visited Washington to help popularize the game in North America, it was the U.S. president who stuck out his hand first.
“You don’t need to introduce yourself because everyone knows who Pelé is,” Ronald Reagan said.
Pelé was Brazil’s first modern Black national hero but rarely spoke about racism in a country where the rich and powerful tend to hail from the white minority.
Opposing fans taunted Pelé with monkey chants at home and all over the world.
“He said that he would never play if he had to stop every time he heard those chants,” said Angelica Basthi, one of Pelé’s biographers. “He is key for Black people’s pride in Brazil, but never wanted to be a flagbearer.”
Pelé’s life after soccer took many forms. He was a politician — Brazil’s Extraordinary Minister for Sport — a wealthy businessman, and an ambassador for UNESCO and the United Nations.
He had roles in movies, soap operas and even composed songs and recorded CDs of popular Brazilian music.
Pelé was an ambassador for his sport until his final years but as his health deteriorated his travels and appearances became less frequent. After needing a hip replacement, he started using a cane.
He was often seen in a wheelchair during his final years and did not attend a ceremony to unveil a statue of him representing Brazil’s 1970 World Cup team.
“He gets very shy, he gets very embarrassed,” his son Edinho told Globoesporte.com. “He doesn’t want to go out.”
Pelé spent his 80th birthday with a few relatives.
Pelé spent a month hospitalized in 2021 after surgery to remove a tumor from his colon. Pelé said he was ready “to play 90 minutes, plus extra time,” but soon started chemotherapy.
Born Edson Arantes do Nascimento, in the small city of Tres Coracoes in the interior of Minas Gerais state on Oct. 23, 1940, Pelé grew up shining shoes to buy his modest soccer gear. His father was also a player.
Pelé’s talent drew notice when he was 11, and a local professional player brought him to Santos’ youth squads. Despite his youth and 5-foot-8 frame Pelé’ scored against grown men with the same ease he displayed against friends back home. He debuted with the Brazilian club at 15 in 1956, and the club quickly gained worldwide recognition.
The name Pelé came from him mispronouncing the name of a player called Bilé. He later became known simply as ‘O Rei’ – The King.
Pelé went to the 1958 World Cup as a reserve but became a key part for his country’s championship team. His first goal, in which he flicked the ball over the head of a defender and raced around him to volley it home, was voted as one of the best in World Cup history.
“When Pelé scored,” veteran Swedish midfielder Sigge Parling said, “I have to be honest and say I felt like applauding.”
The 1966 World Cup in England — won by the hosts — was a bitter one for Pelé, by then already considered the world’s top player. Brazil was knocked out at the group stage and Pelé, angry at fouls and hard tackles by Portugal, swore it was his last World Cup.
He changed his mind and was rejuvenated in the 1970 World Cup. In a game against England, he struck a header for a certain score, but the great goalkeeper Gordon Banks flipped the ball over the bar in an astonishing move. Pelé likened the save — one of the best in World Cup history — to a “salmon climbing up a waterfall.” Later, he scored the opening goal in the final against Italy, his last World Cup match.
In all, Pelé played 114 matches with Brazil, scoring a record 95 goals — including 77 in official matches. Most of his goals came with Santos, which he led to five national titles, two Copa Libertadores trophies and two club world championships — all in the 1960s.
His run with Santos stretched over three decades until he went into semi-retirement after the 1972 season. Wealthy European clubs tried to sign him, but the Brazilian government intervened to keep him from being sold, declaring him a national treasure.
On the field, Pelé’s energy, vision and imagination drove a gifted Brazilian national team, with intricate passing combinations slicing defenses while leaving room for players to showcase flashy skills.
The fast, fluid style of play exemplified “O Jogo Bonito” — Portuguese for “The Beautiful Game.” And at the center of it all, like a maestro in command of his orchestra, was Pelé. It was his 1977 autobiography, “My Life and the Beautiful Game,” that made the phrase part of soccer’s lexicon.
In 1975, he joined the New York Cosmos of the North American Soccer League. Although he was past his prime at 34 years old, Pelé briefly gave soccer a higher profile in North America before ending his career on Oct. 1, 1977, in an exhibition between the Cosmos and Santos. Among the dignitaries on hand was perhaps the only other athlete whose renown spanned the globe — Muhammad Ali.
Pelé had two daughters out of wedlock and five children from his first two marriages, to Rosemeri dos Reis Cholbi and Assiria Seixas Lemos. He later married businesswoman Marcia Cibele Aoki.

Erling Haaland scored twice on his Premier League debut as Manchester City opened its title defense with a 2-0 win over West Ham on Sunday, showing just why Pep Guardiola spent big to bring in the striker this offseason.
Haaland needed 35 minutes to open his City account from the penalty spot after being brought down by the goalkeeper in the area, and then netted with a clinical low finish in the 65th minute to double the lead.
After Liverpool was held to a draw by Fulham on Saturday, City sent an early warning that it remains the team to beat in England.
City led the league in scoring last season with 99 goals as it edged Liverpool to the title by one point, despite often playing without a recognized striker up front. Having the towering Haaland in the middle only makes Guardiola’s attack look even scarier.
After City struggled to break down West Ham’s defense in the opening 30 minutes, Haaland showed his speed to accelerate away from two defenders as he ran onto a pass into the box from Ilkay Gundogan and was brought down by substitute goalkeeper Alphonse Areola as they vied for the ball.
He calmly dispatched the penalty by sidefooting into the left corner and then sat down cross-legged in a meditative pose — his trademark goal celebration that could become a frequent sight in the Premier League.
Areola, who had to come on in the 29th after Lukasz Fabianski picked up a knock, couldn’t do much to prevent the second goal, either.
Haaland timed his run perfectly to meet a through ball from Kevin de Bruyne and then used his left foot to slot the ball inside the far corner.
Haaland scored 86 goals in 89 games during his three seasons at Borussia Dortmund to establish himself as one of the most-wanted players in Europe before opting to move to City, where his father Alfie played between 2000-03.
Alfie Haaland celebrated in the stands as his son became just the second City player to score twice on his Premier League debut, after Sergio Aguero did so in 2011.
He was taken off in the 78th to a standing ovation, having missed out on a hat trick when his header sailed high.
Judging by this performance, though, it won’t be long before the next goal comes along for Haaland.

New manager, same old problems for Manchester United.
United slumped to a 2-1 loss against Brighton at Old Trafford on Sunday in Erik ten Hag’s first Premier League game in charge, dispelling any notion that the Dutch coach could provide an instant fix to the many issues that plagued the team last season.
United looked vulnerable in defense — with Pascal Gross scoring twice in the first half to put Brighton in control — and toothless in attack until Cristiano Ronaldo came on early in the second half.
And the questions about Ronaldo’s future at the club remain.
Ten Hag decided to leave Ronaldo out of his starting lineup after the Portugal star only played 45 minutes in preseason amid reports he wants to leave for a Champions League club.
But it’s clear why Ten Hag wants to keep the 37-year-old forward as United looked much more dangerous with him on the field, although the hosts needed a goalkeeping error to pull a goal back.
Robert Sanchez failed to punch away a corner and then got in the way of Alexis Mac Allister, who tried to clear the ball only to send it into his own net in the 68th.
United continued to push forward but never came close to an equalizer as Brighton held on for a first win at Old Trafford in the club’s history.
“It was obviously disappointing and the worst possible start at halftime to be 2-0 down at Old Trafford,” United defender Harry Maguire said. “Not good enough. We huffed and puffed and we got one back and we had chances to equalize, but it’s a bad start for us.”
While United improved in the second half, the first 45 minutes showed just how big a task Ten Hag is facing to turn around a club that finished sixth in the Premier League last season.
While the hosts dominated possession, the only good chance they created came in the sixth minute when a cross was deflected into the path of Bruno Fernandes, who sent his shot well high of the bar.
Brighton took the lead in the 30th when Danny Welbeck made a run into the area to collect a pass from Leandro Trossard near the byline and then squared the ball across goal for Gross to tap into an empty net.
The second goal came after a quick counterattack, with Gross on hand to tap in the rebound after Solly March cut inside and saw his shot parried by David de Gea.
“I thought we had an idea of how to attack and when we could we tried to press and put them under pressure,” Brighton manager Graham Potter said. “We were positive, brave and the boys gave everything. Our performance in the first half was really strong.”
Ronaldo instantly gave United a jolt when he came on in the 52nd and set up Marcus Rashford for a one-on-one against Sanchez in the 60th but the goalkeeper blocked the forward’s shot. The offside flag was up against Ronaldo, but replays hinted he had stayed onside.
That was the closest Ronaldo came to making an impact, though, as the Ten Hag era got off to a losing start.
United’s players were booed off at halftime and at the final whistle, with Ten Hag looking grim-faced as he walked off the field.

An unplayable Neymar notched a goal and three assists to lead defending champion Paris Saint-Germain to a 5-0 win at Clermont in the French league on Saturday.
Lionel Messi also made a big contribution with two goals and an assist.
Neymar troubled Clermont with his movement and skills. In the seventh minute, he pounced on a low cross from Achraf Hakimi to have a first-time effort deflected out by Alidu Seidu.
Two minutes later, Pablo Sarabia squared the ball back for Messi, who flicked it toward Neymar. The Brazil forward controlled the ball before burying it into the bottom corner.
PSG capitalized on a fast break in the 26th when Neymar found Achraf Hakimi, who fired into the top corner.
Neymar set up the third goal with a pinpoint free kick for Marquinhos, who headed home in the 39th.
On the stroke of halftime, Neymar fed Messi, whose shot was saved by goalkeeper Mory Diaw.
PSG slowed down a bit in the second half against a Clermont side which narrowly avoided relegation last season.
Messi still made it 4-0 in the 80th. He played a one-two with Neymar before netting with a low strike.
The Argentina superstar sealed the win in the 86th by chesting down a ball over the top from Leandro Paredes to score with an overhead kick.
“What I have liked is the team’s desire to win the ball back very quickly, to play with a lot of intensity,” PSG coach Christophe Galtier said. ”Leo reacts reacts very quickly when possession is lost, and Ney has also made efforts in his defensive positioning to help the team stay very compact and win the ball.”
Chasing a record 11th league title, PSG missed Kylian Mbappe, who is nursing a groin problem, and Renato Sanches, who was signed on Thursday and lacked match fitness.
PSG left out of its matchday squad some high-profile players it reportedly wants to move out: Mauro Icardi, Julian Draxler, Ander Herrera, Idrissa Gueye, Rafinha, Thilo Kehrer and Layvin Kurzawa.
Meanwhile, Krepin Diatta and Sofiane Diop scored for a weakened Monaco to prevail at Strasbourg 2-1.
In a clash between contenders for European spots, Diatta opened the scoring with a powerful volley from the edge of the box in the 43rd. The Senegal winger could have added another goal in the 48th but Strasbourg goalkeeper Matz Sels saved his chip.
Diop, a France Under-21 international, doubled the lead by converting a rebound in the 53rd after Sels palmed away a deflected cross from Gelson Martins.
Strasbourg forward Habib Diallo pulled one back in the 65th by heading in a cross from Thomas Delaine.
Monaco and Strasbourg finished third and sixth, respectively, last season.
Sels limited the damage by denying Martins in the 35th, diverting onto the post a close-range effort from Jean Lucas in the 61st, and saving a downward header from substitute Maghnes Akliouche in the 85th.
Monaco goalkeeper Alexander Nubel preserved the win in injury time by stopping a point-blank shot from Adrien Thomasson.
’We had chances to lead 3-0 and 4-0,” Monaco coach Philippe Clement said. “It’s a matter of experience. It’s normal with young players, they must learn lessons, they must gain experience in such situations.”
Monaco missed the suspended Kevin Volland and Aleksandr Golovin, the injured Takumi Minamino, Benoit Badiashile and Myron Boadu, and an ill Caio Henrique.

While Liverpool made a stuttering start to the English Premier League, Tottenham showed it might be ready to take another step forward under Antonio Conte.
Liverpool had to come from behind twice to salvage a 2-2 draw at promoted Fulham on Saturday, largely thanks to new signing Darwin Nunez, after a performance that Jurgen Klopp conceded was well short of the team’s standards.
Tottenham also conceded an early goal but came roaring back to earn a 4-1 victory at home against Southampton after a dominant display that hinted that Spurs are well gelled after a full offseason under Conte, who took over as manager last November.
Chelsea also had a winning start but in less impressive fashion, holding on for 1-0 at Everton after Jorginho netted a late first-half penalty.
Newcastle, Leeds and Bournemouth also won in their league openers.
At Craven Cottage, Fulham threatened to pull off a major upset as Aleksandar Mitrovic put the hosts ahead twice against Liverpool. But Nunez came off the bench to score one goal and set up the other for Mohamed Salah.
Liverpool nearly grabbed all three points when Jordan Henderson hit the crossbar in injury time with a long-distance shot, but even Klopp agreed that a win would have been undeserved.
“The start of the game was really bad from us,” Klopp said. “No direction, no positivity, no opening up, no breaking lines, nothing (of) what you have to do.”
It was a different story in north London, where Tottenham reacted superbly to going behind in the 12th minute.
Ryan Sessegnon and Eric Dier put Spurs in front by halftime and Southampton defender Mohammed Salibu netted a comical own goal when trying to clear the ball off the line in the 61st minute. Dejan Kulusevski capped a stellar performance by slotting in the fourth two minutes later.
“It was a perfect start for us, despite going behind,” Conte said. “I liked the game a lot for the result but especially the way in which the result was created — creating many chances to score, good possession, good high and medium pressure and we were good when we lost the ball and the intensity to try and get it back. ... Today we have seen (the) summer work with my players.”
Conte spent much of last season complaining about a lack of squad depth, but still opted not to start any of the team’s six offseason signings. Ivan Perisic, Clement Lenglet and Yves Bissouma came off the bench instead to show that Conte also has increased options this season as Spurs tries to join champion Manchester City and Liverpool in the fight for the title.
NEWCASTLE SPOILS FOREST’S RETURN
Nottingham Forest spent most of the game defending in its return to the top flight after an absence of 23 years. The newcomer held firm for nearly an hour at St. James’ Park but couldn’t prevent Newcastle’s Fabian Schar from finally breaking the deadlock with a long-range shot. Newcastle won 2-0 after Callum Wilson added the second in the 78th.
“We were second best in the game no doubt,” Forest manager Steve Cooper said. “We coped OK in terms of possession and territory but didn’t play well enough with the ball.”
Fellow newcomer Bournemouth got off to a better start after Scott Parker won the battle of the former England midfielders as his team earned a 2-0 home win over Steven Gerrard’s Aston Villa.
Jefferson Lerma and Kieffer Moore scored either side of halftime at Vitality Stadium as Gerrard — who played alongside Parker at Euro 2012 — cut a frustrated figure for much of the afternoon.
His expensively assembled team dominated possession in the south-coast sunshine but was toothless in attack.
AARONSON GIVES LEEDS A SPARK
There was a distinct American flavor to Leeds’ 2-1 win over Wolverhampton at home.
U.S international Brenden Aaronson played a key part in the winning goal as he rushed in to meet a cross from Patrick Bamford, although it was credited as an own goal by defender Rayan Ait-Nouri, who tried to clear the ball only to poke it into his own.
Leeds went behind early when Daniel Podence scored for the visitors in the sixth minute with a volley that spun off the turf and in off the underside of the crossbar.
Rodrigo leveled for the hosts in the 24th.
Aaronson and fellow U.S. international Tyler Adams made their first starts for Leeds, which is managed by American coach Jesse Marsch.
“All the debutants did quite well,” Marsch told the BBC. ”(Aaronson) is relentless. He is nonstop. His work rate is incredible. I know him well and the thing I know about him is he is only going to get better.”
CHELSEA ‘HAVE THINGS TO IMPROVE’
Chelsea earned its first win at Goodison Park in five visits, but coach Thomas Tuchel acknowledged his team looked rusty as he tries to incorporate new signings while coping with the lack of a pure striker.
“We have things to improve but this isn’t a surprise,” Tuchel said. “We struggled physically but showed the spirit to get the clean sheet.”
Everton is also without a striker and lost two more players as Ben Godfrey was carried off early with a suspected broken leg and Yerry Mina exited in the second half with an ankle injury.
Godfrey’s injury meant there was eight minutes of stoppage time in the first half, and Jorginho converted a penalty seconds before the interval after Abdoulaye Doucoure pulled down Ben Chilwell.

Tottenham recovered quickly from going a goal down and routed Southampton 4-1 in their English Premier League opener Saturday to show the team’s new strength in depth.
Attacking duo Harry Kane and Son Heung-min failed to get on the scoresheet, but it was fellow forward Dejan Kulusevski who orchestrated the comeback.
The Sweden international set up the equalizer for Ryan Sessegnon before he slotted the fourth goal himself after the break, following an Eric Dier header and Mohammed Salisu’s own goal.
It backed up the growing anticipation around Antonio Conte’s side, which has been tipped by many to join champion Manchester City and Liverpool in the title race.
James Ward-Prowse put Saints into an early lead, but the hosts regrouped immediately to start the new campaign in strong fashion, even though none of their six new signings made the starting lineup.
It took 12 minutes for the first legitimate chance to present itself and Southampton took full advantage to open the scoring through Ward-Prowse.
Moussa Djenepo got away from Emerson Royal down the left and chipped back to the edge of the area where Ward-Prowse fired home on the volley, his effort bouncing into the ground and beating Spurs keeper Hugo Lloris.
The hosts trailed for only nine minutes.
After Southampton had dealt with a number of early crosses into the area, they had little answer in the 21st minute when Kulusevski checked back onto his left foot and curled in for Sessegnon, who leapt above Kyle Walker-Peters to power home the equalizer.
Conte’s team completed the turnaround in the 31st through another unlikely source.
Son saw his initial corner cleared but soon received possession back and produced a fine inswinging delivery, which proved perfect for Dier to stoop low and head on into the bottom corner to make it 2-1.
Sessegnon had the ball in the net again immediately after halftime but his finish with his right foot was ruled out due to offside.
Tottenham should have already been two goals to the good with Kane denied by Bazunu before the break and Son wasteful from six yards when he could have passed to his teammate.
While the pair scored 40 goals between them in the league last season, it was Kulusevski who took center stage on this occasion.
The Swede nearly set up Sessegnon again with a delicious pass before the third arrived for the hosts in the 61st.
Emerson led a counterattack and exchanged passes with Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg and Son before his scuffed cross was put through his own net by an off-balance Salisu.
Kulusevski saved the best until last when he latched onto Emerson’s cutback, opened up his body and curled into the bottom corner to make it 4-1 and give Spurs a second goal in the space of two minutes.
Conte made a quadruple substitution late on and gave Ivan Perisic, Clement Lenglet and Yves Bissouma their debuts.

New Liverpool signing Darwin Nunez came off the bench to score one goal and set up another Saturday as the Reds salvaged a 2-2 draw at promoted Fulham in the opening round of the Premier League.
Aleksandar Mitrovic put Fulham ahead twice at Craven Cottage as Marco Silva’s team threatened a major upset, but Nunez showed just why Liverpool spent big to bring the Uruguay forward in from Benfica this offseason.
Nunez first met a low cross from Mohamed Salah with a deft backheel flick into the top of the net to make it 1-1 in the 64th minute, and then helped his Egyptian teammate net the second equalizer in the 81st. Nunez tried to control a high cross into the box that time but the ball instead fell into the path of Salah, who had a simple tap-in.
Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson then came close to an injury-time winner when his curling long-distance shot hit the crossbar.
Mitrovic headed in the opening goal in the first half, rising above Trent Alexander-Arnold at the far post to meet a cross from the right, and then converted a penalty in the 72nd minute after he was brought down by Virgil van Dijk.
Fulham also had a chance to make it 2-0 in the 57th when Neeskens Kebano hit the post with a shot from the right side of the area after a quick attack.
The draw will still count as a setback for Liverpool, which is aiming to wrest back the Premier League title after finishing one point behind champion Manchester City last season.
Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp opted against starting Nunez even though the newcomer made quite an impression in preseason and scored in the Community Shield win over City last weekend. Roberto Firmino was given the start up front instead, but Liverpool’s attack clicked into a higher gear once Nunez came on for the Brazilian.

 Arsenal’s newcomers made an immediate impact as they opened the English Premier League by beating host Crystal Palace 2-0 on Friday.
Left back Oleksandr Zinchenko set up the opening goal in the first half while striker Gabriel Jesus created a number of chances and defender William Saliba put in a near-flawless performance in his first start for Arsenal.
The Gunners still had to endure a nervy second half before Bukayo Saka’s attempted cross was deflected into his own net by Palace defender Marc Guehi in the 85th.
Arsenal took the lead from a well-worked corner in the 20th, when Zinchenko met a long delivery into the area and headed back across goal toward Gabriel Martinelli, who nodded the ball in from close range.
Martinelli should have scored in the opening minutes after a rampaging run from Jesus, who dribbled his way into the box before the ball was deflected into the path of his fellow Brazilian, who scuffed his shot wide of the far post.
“The way we started the game, the way we played the first half an hour, I think was superb,” Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta said. “We should have scored another one or two, we missed some chances. But (if) you want to win here, you have to dig in.”
Zinchenko and Jesus both joined from Manchester City in the offseason while Saliba was signed in 2019 but spent the last three seasons on loan in his native France. The center back looked composed and confident in his league debut, making key interventions and blocks as Palace chased an equalizer.
“It’s a long time I waited for this moment,” Saliba said. “I’m so glad to start with a clean sheet and a win.”
Arsenal also needed two good saves from goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale to maintain the lead.
Ramsdale first reacted quickly to palm away a close-range header from Odsonne Edouard in the 42nd minute, then got down low to block a shot from Eberechi Eze in the 54th.
“Aaron did incredibly well and he won the game for us,” Arteta said.
For Arsenal, it made for a much better start to the season than last year, when it also opened the campaign on a Friday night but fell to at promoted Brentford 2-0 and went on to lose the next two games as well.

Industry Minister Gajendra Hamal has resigned 40 hours after appointment. Hamal has said he has resigned listening to his conscience after widespread criticism of the appointment. Baluwatar has tried to spin the resignation by Hamal of his own volition to save its face. The press note issued by Baluwatar mentions that Hamal has resigned on request of Prime Minister (PM) Sher Bahadur Deuba even as audio recording of Hamal requesting to broadcast/publish the issue through the media pointing that Deuba may reject his resignation has been made public.
One fact has been irrefutably established despite all the efforts of damage control by Baluwatar. The democracy in Nepal has been attacked in an unimaginable manner last week.
Politicians and people in the judiciary can some time commit mistakes in course of work and do work that should not be done. But the deed of PM Deuba and Chief Justice (CJ) Cholendra Shumsher Rana with consent of the top leaders of ruling coalition is an unthinkable crime in democracy. CJ seeking share of spoils in the government and the ruling parties accepting that is unimaginable in democracy.
The main source of this misdeed is CJ Rana, and his unconstitutional aspirations. Rana had the temerity to seek a share in power violating the sanctity of judiciary believing he can do anything he wishes.
The ruling coalition should have strongly resisted this impudence by CJ Rana. But the coalition easily accepted his demand reflecting at once the gratitude of the coalition toward some of the past verdicts by CJ and fear that he may put the government in another crisis.
Rana has been enjoying the fallout of the havoc he has wreaked from the sacred chair of CJ and making mockery of democracy. It is not hard to see that Rana has been influencing the court’s verdicts in a way that benefits one party or another, and reaping political benefits for that.
Two major verdicts by the Supreme Court (SC) in cases related to political parties are now under suspicion. The SC verdict to revoke unification of CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Center) restoring the two parties to the state before unification in a case related to the unified party using name of another registered party was against the Constitution, laws and jurisdiction of the judiciary. That verdict was unimaginable.  
The refusal by the SC to issue an interim order in the case against the ordinance making splitting of parties easier issued hastily by the Deuba government after suddenly ending the House session, and subsequent delay in issuing final verdict in the case have also raised suspicions. Every government has undermined the parliament by bringing ordinance and tampered with laws for its vested interests. There will be no meaning of democratic norms of the people’s representatives formulating laws and the rule of law if that is not controlled.
The SC recently had revoked the ordinance brought by the KP Oli government to amend the act related to citizenship immediately after dissolving the House. The court had done a commendable job of curbing the autocratic tendency of the executive to rule through ordinances by avoiding the parliament. The final verdict in that case would have set a good precedent and curbed abuse of powers bolstering democracy and rule of law.
But the SC has again treaded the wrong path in the case related to the ordinance about splitting of parties. The SC has blatantly ignored the precedent it established in the ordinance related to citizenship. The double standard of the Apex Court in cases related to two similar ordinances has not just hit the credibility of the judiciary but raised suspicions that CJ Rana influences court verdicts to serve his immoral interests in connivance with political parties. CJ Rana has himself proved the suspicions to be true by accepting his share in Cabinet expansion.
Opposing such immoral acts of CJ is not opposing the judiciary or attacking the dignity of the court. The judiciary is not an individual justice or CJ, for that matter, who does not remain within the limits and disregards the sanctity of the judiciary.
Condemning such justices rather saves the judiciary and all those honest justices who continuously work with constitutional integrity and cannot even think about treading the path Rana has taken. Slamming Rana will save the justices who twice revived the House dissolved unconstitutionally by Oli going against Rana’s wishes. Criticizing Rana will safeguard the public trust over those very justices who have not participated in the political dealmaking of Rana.
We should not forget here that CJ Rana agreed to reinstate the House for the first time only after three justices in the five-strong constitutional bench stood for House reinstatement. Two justices refused to stay in the constitutional bench formed by CJ Rana in the case against the second dissolution by Oli. The rest of the justices then forced Rana to constitute the bench on the basis of seniority. The constitutional bench formed on the basis of seniority then reinstated the House.  
The current transgression by Rana has provided an opportunity to UML leaders to claim that the verdict for House reinstatement was also given on the basis of political machination. Rana in this way has not just dragged other SC justices working with honesty and integrity into suspicion but also gravely reduced the credibility of the judiciary.
CJ Rana would have deserved impeachment if politicians at the top were not complicit in such grave crimes. Merely demanding share in government would be sufficient to impeach a CJ in a well-functioning democracy. But our politicians are so lowly and decadent that they are condemned to fulfilling the quota demanded by CJ in appointments in the government and constitutional bodies. Oli gave Rana share in appointments in constitutional bodies when he was PM. Deuba gave Rana a share even in the Cabinet this time.
Our politicians will not muster moral courage to impeach Rana due to this background. The responsibility to resist the immoral deeds of Rana is now on the judiciary itself. The SC justices, the Nepal Bar Association, and the SC Bar Association must seriously carry out consultations. Such incidents erode the legitimacy of democracy and undermine rule of law, and the courageous stand of people with integrity and honesty at such times will instill life in democracy and save democracy.
Nepali Congress (NC) that considers itself to be the mother of parliamentary democracy in Nepal and its leaders and cadres also have a huge responsibility. Maoist Center Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who does not respect or believe in parliamentary democracy a bit, defending Hamal’ appointment is not surprising because he believes all the means toward climbing to power and staying are fair. But NC leaders and cadres should seriously contemplate whether corruption of the executive by an immoral and whimsical CJ is acceptable in parliamentary democracy or not? Whether the party president who has committed such a grave attack and crime against democracy is acceptable or not? Whether the party president can continue to lead the party and government in the coming days or not? Why should the Nepali people bear with Deuba who undermines democracy, Constitution and the party ideals every time he reaches power even if the party leaders and cadres consider him fit to be party president? Why should NC under Deuba again be sent to the government?
The coming days will show how people in the judiciary retaliate against CJ’s arbitrariness or those in NC will resist Deuba. But one thing is absolutely clear. Deuba and Rana, and not Hamal, are the ones who should be punished in this episode. The attack on democracy by PM Deuba and CJ Rana, who have repeatedly failed to maintain clean image even in the past, this time has plummeted their image to the nadir of ignominy. History will not absolve them of this ignominy.

A wrong history has been repeated when the government sent an ordinance about splitting parties to the president evading the House today.
The then prime minister KP Sharma Oli had first tried the ignominious option on April 20, 2020 to engineer a split in Federal Socialist Forum Nepal (FSFN) even as his party had almost a two-third majority in the House. He eventually took the ordinance back along with that about the Constitutional Council following widespread condemnation within his own party and without, and after FSFN hastily unified with Rastriya Janata Party (RJP) to stop the split that Oli had plotted.
Oli again brought the two ordinances eight months later on December 15, 2020 to split ruling CPN if needed after Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Madhav Kumar Nepal allied to put him in minority and then continued appointments at constitutional bodies against the spirit of Constitution.
He had brought the ordinance about splitting parties first to split FSFN and then to split his own party, and that about the Constitutional Council on both the occasions to curtail representation of opposition in constitutional bodies.
Sher Bahadur Deuba has now given Oli a taste of his own medicine pushing CPN-UML on the verge of split. Deuba would not have even dared to bring the ordinance had Oli not done so last year. Oli would have moral grounds to oppose that even if Deuba had. Oli's acolytes who defended the ordinances last year or did not oppose them also do not have the right to oppose the ordinance brought by Deuba.   
Those who had opposed the ordinances brought by Oli then have every right to oppose this ordinance now. And they must oppose this undemocratic step with determination. There should be no doubt that the axe Deuba has today taken to the House will not just hurt Oli but our democracy. It will ultimately undermine democracy.
Parties are agents of democracy and democracy becomes weak if the agents become weak. Repeated disputes and splits in parties erode democracy. Frustrate the people. Inspire the anti-democratic forces and those who want to wind the clock back.
The ordinance about splitting parties brought by Oli last year and Deuba now has undone the democratic reforms we started. This is unpardonable attack on democracy by both of them. There is a long background to the legal provision we now have about splitting parties. Nepali Congress (NC) nearly split during the first term of the House after restoration of democracy in 1990. There was a wave of splits in parties including UML, the then largest party in the House, during the second term. The then third largest party RPP split repeatedly. Horse trading of lawmakers and holding them hostage in hotels inside and outside the country started then. That instilled aversion toward the parliamentary system in the people.
The situation worsened after the Jana Andolan II. The three Madhes-based parties elected to the First Constituent Assembly (CA) with a big mandate splintered into 18. There were over two dozen parties in the CA due to the proportional representation (PR) electoral system. Leaders of those small parties sold the PR seats to the highest bidders.  
There was a strong demand and intense pressure from the public, the media and even inside big political parties to stop this wrong practice. We made two corrections in the law after the Constitution was promulgated in 2015.  
The first is that a party must get at least three percent of PR votes, and win at least one seat in the first past the post electoral system (FPTP) to become a national party and to be eligible to get PR seats in the House. That limited the number of recognized national parties in the House to five even though it was 25 in the CA.
We also made another improvement in the act about political parties. The act earlier had the provision allowing split of political parties with support of 40 percent in the central committee or the parliamentary party. That was amended to make it require support of 40 percent in both the parliamentary party and the central committee to split any political party.
This stopped the practice of winning the election on ticket of a party and later splitting the party by taking a fat sum or to become minister. No party has split in the current House after the provision came into force. CPN split into CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Center) on order of the Supreme Court.
This ordinance brought by Deuba, however, has paved the way for UML to split. He has brought the ordinance allowing split of political parties with support of 20 percent in the central committee or the parliamentary party to serve his interest.
Oli can oopt for revenge if he again comes to power in the future and bring an ordinance allowing split of political parties with support of just 10 percent in the central committee or the parliamentary party to engineer a split in NC or another party.
Deuba, who has been linked with almost all the wrong political practices since restoration of democracy in 1990 if he has not initiated those practices, will not have moral right to protest then like Oli now.

Once again, the issue of caste discrimination is dominating national conversation.
Amid an uproar over a journalist being denied a room in rent because of her caste and the subsequent intervention by a minister to get the landlord accused of such discrimination released, ideas and proposals on how to break away with such violations of national and human rights laws have been hitting the headlines.
A national campaign has been urged to end discrimination against Dalits and this is surely something worth considering but we need to reflect about the details, the contents and the overall goal of such proposal.
Should such campaign just be focused on the stigmas faced by citizens belonging to the Dalit community or instead have an enlarged “radar” and bring in also an attention on other groups within the society that have also been object of a pattern of discrimination on a consistent basis?
Think about many marginalized indigenous groups in the country. Think about members of the citizenry discriminated and abused because of their sexual orientation. Think about members of disability community or members of Muslim community or citizens from Madhes that have been often perceived as strangers.
You surely also have sections of the so-called dominating groups with grievances as well.
The more you think, the more you realize that discrimination in the country has been a constituent part of the old system that in many ways is still pervasive in so many aspects of daily lives.
Many positive changes happened but they are not enough.
It is important to recognize this reality but inevitably this also brings about the issues of the so-called perpetrators, those who are perceived and seen as holding on to the ancient discriminatory status quo.
This is an extremely delicate and sensitive issue and to better understand how divisive it can turn out, I spent considerable time reading about Critical Race Theory (CRT) and all the divisions that this subject, unintentionally or, for some, intentionally, is creating in the United States of America.
CRT is a broad area of studies that tries to understand how racism has permeated many aspects of the life in the United States, offering to explain how the ongoing discrimination against minorities there must be read through the prism of a system that for so many years was structurally designed to favor the white majority while intentionally leaving behind all the rest.
Acknowledging past historical injustices, recognizing how certain groups were discriminated in the name of a very limited and selective concept of freedoms and justice, principles applicable for so long just to certain members of the society, makes sense to me.
Yet the process must be driven toward reconciliation and centered on a will to deal with the past without indiscriminate blaming of present and future generations belonging to certain groups that are accused for past injustices.
The problems start when such attempts are, intentionally or not, used to create a wedge in the society, pitting whites versus African Americans, Latinos or Asian Americans or other members of minorities like native Americans who have been historically discriminated.
You read about “weaponization” of the concept of race as many white Americans are strongly pushing back CRT teaching because they feel that such studies are portraying all whites as inherently racist.
On the other side some members of the minority groups might be instead keen to ask not for reconciliation or healing but for revenge and this is extremely dangerous.
A reckoning with the past has become, at least for those pushing back against it, about group identities where individuals are risked to be judged not for their personal actions and behaviors but are considered as member of a certain racial groups.
In a way, for many, the entire issue has not been about reconciliation but about white oppressors versus minorities being perennially oppressed.
The issue is extremely complicated and inflammable as extremes on both sides of the equation might further polarize the issue, sowing more divisions.
I think that this long introspection in what’s happening in the USA is important for Nepal as well.
As the country is extremely diverse and with many layers of discrimination still thriving in many people’s mindsets, it is essential to have a national conversation about diversity and discrimination faced by many citizens.
It is about reflecting on hidden privileges and it is about realizing and admitting that a citizen’s status and position could have been influenced by certain norms and patterns that enabled one’s privileges at the expenses of others.
It is true that the Constitution and laws are now strong enough to formally punish any acts of discrimination but this is not enough. Incidents like the one experienced by citizens being denied a room or apartment, would not happen if it were.
That is why we need to have a national discussion centered around the issue of discrimination and injustices with the overall intent to ensure that such reckoning does not bring further division and bitterness as is happening in the USA.
For sure it is something that would make someone uncomfortable and uneasy but this would be part of a process of national healing.
We should not forget that after all, the Maoist insurgency here was initiated in the name of a better and more just country for all.
It is essential that all members of the traditionally dominating groups realize that the game was not fair for many other members of the society that in the past could not even imagine themselves as equal peers.
Only together, in the spirit of understanding, reconciliation and healing, a new pathway can be found for the country to emerge stronger and more just.
Dealing with the past does not necessarily mean keeping on blaming some members of the society for the ways the system was structured in the past but it certainly implies an acknowledgement of it.
Any divisive issues like stronger quota systems and other positive discrimination measures should be discussed in a spirit of healing certain fault lines that do exist in Nepal as well.
Such mechanisms should be decided and accepted wholeheartedly by those who might lose something out of them because they can be indispensable in creating a real level playing field in the country.
As emotional as such conversation might be, a certain detachment will be needed to listen to each other and better understand all the sides of the equation. Only an exercise centered on deep listening and reflective silence will do the job.
We need to create a multi-stakeholder coalition to fight against all kinds of discriminations but we need to make sure that the highest number of citizens, including those from the traditionally predominant groups, fully embrace such efforts.
Dealing with discrimination starts with understanding, and understanding leads to reflections, and reflections bring to a process of self-realization.
As a consequence, consciously or unconsciously, patterns of thinking and behaving might change and if this process is properly done, the changes will not cause a pushback like in the United States but a new beginning instead.
Nepal can come up with its own way of dealing with the past and present injustices.
A prosperous nation can only thrive if the grievances of many and the concerns of others are discussed and wisely dealt with.
In the United States the discussions are turning more and more divisive but in Nepal it could be an entirely different story.

Brahman, Kshatriya, Vaishya, Shudra. These are the four different labels that unequalize equally born humans. This article answers why and how society engraves these marks upon our identity.
Bhardwaj, a prominent sage of the Mahabharat era asks another sage Bhrigu, ""What is it that distinguishes the Varna?"" Bhrigu opined, the Varna is a color-coded system. To this, Bhardwaj replied that, colors are seen among all Varnas; the sensation of desire, anger, fear, greed, grief, anxiety, hunger and toil prevails over all human beings; the flow of bile and blood happens in all human bodies, so how are they different? (Hiltebeitel Alf, Dharma: Its Early History In Law, Religion, And Narrative, 2011)
Varna is a Sanskrit word that literally translates into English as color or complexion. The Varna system is rooted in Hinduism but Dharmashastras and Upanishads are obscure about racial prejudice based on color. Different colors have been observed within the same Varna ruling out the possibility of distinction based on color. So, the same question arises time and again: ‘What actually distinguishes Varna?’
The idea of Varna system has a long history and tradition dating back to Vedic times. Manusmiriti is considered one of the prominent historical texts that talks about the Varna Byabastha (i.e., system of Varna) in the Vedic era. The law of Varna teaches each one of us to earn our own bread by following the ancestral calling. Our ancestors divided themselves into different social classes which are today popularly known as Varnas or put more regressively, the ‘re-constructed castes’. Back then it defined not our rights but our duties. With the introduction of the Varna system, society was segregated into four major divisions. People who were associated with scholarly works and religious works were classified as Brahman. People who were good at administration and warfare were given the title of Kshatriya. People who were good at trade and businesses were called Vaishya. The laborers and service providers were called Shudra.
Lord Krishna says in the twenty-seventh verse of the second chapter of the Bhagavad Gita that people of earth are classified into four Varnas on the basis of their 'Guna' i.e., quality. The one who is wise, moral, virtuous, and manifests principles of proper conduct is 'Sattoguni', thus called Brahman. Kshatriya is 'Rajoguni' characterized by higher energy, passion, desire, and pain tolerance. They have the qualities of an administrator. Vaishya has mixed quality of 'Rajoguni' and 'Tamoguni'. Shudra is 'Tamoguni', characterized by lethargy and ignorance.
It is perplexing to trace the origin of the Varna system. However, it is assumed that in the past, not everyone had the access to education and some privileged classes acquired knowledge and exerted power over the society. The four Varna system might be a new concept but the trend of class division is as old as humankind and has prevailed in almost every human civilization. In this regard, Winston Churchill correctly quotes that ""History is written by the victors and powerful people"". Long ago when the Varna system actually came into light, the then powerful people, the educated ones were involved in the paper and administrative works. By the virtue of the power they wielded, they classified people into four Varnas on the basis of the nature of their profession. Thus, the four Varnas; Brahman, Kshatriya, Vaishya, and Shudra, collectively known as Savarnas came into existence. There were other people called ‘Avarnas’ who were considered unworthy to fall under any of those four classes (Chandra et.al, India's Struggle For Independence 1857-1947 (1989). In the present day, some Dalits and other backward castes fall under the category of 'Avarnas'; deemed untouchables.
Some historians are convinced that the Varna system is solely formed on the basis of the nature of work, some claim it to be a color-coded system while others relate it to the Varnakram set by Dharmashatras. Although the historicity of Varna system is ambiguous, the exclusion of Avarnas is an evidence that the discrimination was practised even before the Varna system came into existence and somehow the discriminatory mindset of the privileged class was behind the introduction of this systematic oppression. This is supported by the fact that Vaishyas and Shudras were deprived of basic education and they had to indulge in the works requiring limited basic skills. It is an utmost truth that the Varna system was introduced by those who wielded the power at that time. The famous Irish Singer, Frank Harte was once quoted to have said, ""Those in power write the history, while those who suffer write the songs."" It is obvious that the rulers reconstructed the society in such a manner that the hierarchy set by them would always favor them and they could continue ruling over the lower class people. Put simply, the Varna system was not solely divided on the basis of the nature of work and activities. There is a popular saying that “Works are not to be considered big or small, every kind of work is equal” but at the same time, the reason behind different people being discriminated is the nature of their work. The entire process of assigning a hierarchical position to profession ranging from honor to humiliation is the dissatisfaction that we carry against the Varna system. We eat the crops they harvest in the utensils they make but we hesitate to dine with them. But, this is not completely our fault, we are only doing what we have been taught by our parents. This is the stance we use in our defence when we are confronted with our discriminatory behaviour.
In Nepal, it was King Jaysthiti Malla who systematized the caste system by introducing four Varnas and sixty-four Jaats. After the unification of Nepal, it was Prithvi Narayan Shah who modified the caste system into four Varnas and thirty-six Jaats. Whatever the intention may have been, it has always oppressed the so-called lower caste people systematically. In the present day Nepal, Dalits are routinely denied access to religious sites; they face resistance to inter-caste marriages; non-acceptance of water touched by Dalits and the list of discriminatory practices goes on. As stated earlier, this is the outcome of classifying and discriminating the work and profession itself. Among the four, Shudras are the critical sufferer of the Varna system because the nature of their work is considered derogatory in the books of our society. We have always turned away from the fact that the same work is feeding us and keeping us in a healthy environment. It is high time we understand that every work is meritorious and equal in status, as long as it is done with honesty, morality and lawfulness.
The Varna system is not something that we should pass on to the next generation as an ornamental ancestral relic. In the present, people from all Varnas are doing all kinds of work. The segregation of work no longer exists. People of Shudra community are involved in scholarly works, administrative works and trade activities because now they too have access to education. Brahmans can do business activities and are doing too. Some so-called higher caste people are working as laborer and service-provider abroad while acting as the sole child of God in our own land. This proves that the disrespect for a profession has disappeared from our conscience but the social acceptance of the fact is yet to come.
Let us take a moment and have a good look around us, we see our society is changing slowly and gradually. It is not as orthodoxical as it was in the past. There is healthy acculturation of the works that were previously understood hereditary privilege. The children of Brahmans are not necessarily involved in religious works; Kshatriyas are not necessarily involved in administrative works; Vaishyas are not obliged to carry on their parent’s business, and Shudras are not meant to serve all. The ancestral family profession has shifted from being a compulsion to optional. The choice of our profession is upon us and living in a democratic society, choice is what matters the most. No one holds the power to assign class, put a label or compel others to any profession. We lived in the past where the nature of our work determined our class and category but today our caste should not be the determining factor in our work.
Going back to history, it has always been hypocritical in matters of the Varna system. In the epic tale of Mahabharat, Bhisma forbade Karna from putting up a fight against Arjun because he belonged to a lower caste family and thus was supposed to work as a rider of a chariot as his father did. Considering Mahabharat not as mythology but as a history, it portrayed the then society where the rulers did not allow lower caste people to indulge in another profession. Society was run according to the will of people in power. Karna, being a Sut Putra (son of a chariot driver), was denied knowledge of armory by Dronacharya and was deprived of honor by Bhisma. But when King Shantanu, the father of Bhisma, fell in love with a fisherman’s daughter decades earlier, Bhisma was the one who lobbied for the marriage of a Kshatriya King and a fisherman’s daughter. Observing my society I understood that fishermen fall under the Vaishya's category and Bhisma accepting Vaishya stepmother contradicts his own bias against Karna that deprived him of the respect he deserved due to his caste. This story clearly depicts the hypocrisy of the lawmakers who made the Varna system to give a new structure to the society but ultimately set the hierarchy so as to continue their rule over people below them.
It is the ultimate truth of our society that casteism exists. The one who believes that there is no such thing as caste or Varna, is evidently living in denial. They are not ready to share their privileges with the so-called lower castes. To understand this thoroughly we need to visit the rural areas: My hometown is in the south-east of Jaleshwar Municipality in Mahottari District. People of different castes like Maithil Brahman, Bhumihar, Khatbe, Chamar, Kewat, etc. live there and all of them have their separate tole (colony). I was born and brought up there but it was only after my high-school, I realized my village has different colonies like Brahman Tole, Chamar Tole, Khatwe Tole, etc. A year ago when my grandfather passed away, according to the culture of tarai, we arranged feast for the villagers. When villagers arrived and the feast began, the people of all castes sat with their own caste only and avoided contact with the people of other castes. At first, it was surprising to me because I was living in ignorance as I believed that my villagers do not discriminate merely on the basis of caste but the ground reality was different and beyond my imagination.
This is an example but not the only example. Recalling the Rukum incident where Navaraj BK and his friends were killed, it is prima facie evident that he was beaten to death because he belonged to the Dalit community and dared to fall in love with a girl of so-called higher caste. Our society is still filled with people who label us with a particular Varna at the moment we are born. Navaraj BK was killed because loving a girl is a sin in the eyes of our society and it is a bigger sin when the label of lower caste is engraved in our identity. It is an ignominy that a man gets killed for falling in love because he was a Dalit in the 21st century. Had he belonged to the higher caste he might have been alive today. This fact will haunt us as long as we unequalize equally born humans labelling them as Brahmans, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and Shudras.
In a democratic society, different people have different opinions and thus different ideologies become the factor for the evolution of different religions. I have a firm belief that religion is the product of ideology and faith. But, the Varna system or the caste system is nowhere the product of either ideology or faith even though the Varna system has its roots in the Sanatan (eternal) Hindu Dharma. The very first factor that played role in the division of Varna was the nature of work people practised and then gradually the discriminatory notions overtook the structure and it became a hereditary trait in due course of time.
Some people argue that discrimination is a very human thing, it has nothing to do with the Varna system but we cannot disagree with the fact that Varna system is the product of discrimination and vice-versa. In no way discrimination is a human thing, so let's try our best to erase the predetermined notions set by Varna system and teach ourselves and our future generations that the Varna system was a privilege given to the already privileged class and, therefore, a burden to the lower class. Some say, it was revolutionary to give the new structure to the society and some people are of the view that it was the systematization of the class division with the flavor of discrimination. While the motive behind bringing the Varna system into practice is ambiguous, the discrimination it brought with needs to stop. It should not be passed on to the next generation.

Events like Education Minister Krishna Gopal Shrestha dropping the landlord who allegedly refused to lease a room to Rupa Sunar due to her caste need no explanation.
One can understand the society being divided about how big a mistake the landlord's refusal to lease the room on the basis of caste is, and how some have taken this as a minor incident. One can also understand how some are angry that the woman, nearly 60, was locked up for three days and others sympathize with her. One can understand all these things in a society that has been mired in caste system for centuries and also understand arguments of some that it takes time to change the society.   
The police had submitted the investigation file to the District Government Attorney Office which could have decided whether to take the case to the court or not if it were allowed to do its work fairly. The court could have then found the woman guilty or acquitted her. We all would and should have accepted the verdict.
But the government hijacked the case that was in a judicial process. The District Government Attorney Office did not move the case forward citing lack of evidence and sent it back to the police for further investigation. Minister Shrestha went to the police station for release of the accused and dropped her home in his official vehicle fluttering the national flag.
It's the words of Sunar against that of the woman in the case for now in lack of evidence and people are free to choose which side to trust. But the woman has not been acquitted by the court and the District Government Attorney Office, under pressure from the government, has only sent the file back for further investigation. And she still remains accused of the offense.
The Constitution has explicitly prohibited any kind of discrimination on the basis of caste. Minister Shrestha appointed in accordance to the Constitution cannot use that position to solicit release of a person accused of an offense prohibited by the Constitution that he has sworn to while taking oath as a lawmaker and minister. He also cannot use the vehicle he got in capacity of the position as minister to drop the accused home. He also cannot flutter the national flag recognized by the Constitution to provide official endorsement for his abominable and unpardonable act.
It is not hard to see why Minister Shrestha did that. The accused is a Newar woman and many naively say he stood for the Newar community. But we firmly believe that he did that for votebank politics and not for the Newar community. He would have stood for dozens of families who were rendered homeless in the name of road expansion in Balaju if he stood for the benefit of Newars. He was nowhere to be seen when the indigenous people in the Kathmandu Valley suffered from glottophobia for years. Where does he stand in the ongoing movement to conserve the culture and heritage of the Valley, and revive the Valley to its glorious ancient form? His action has once again revealed the age-old nature of opportunistic politicians to try to cash in on social disputes.
Minister Shrestha going to the police station in this manner is tantamount to the state, that should have stood up for the victim, standing against the victim. This is not just a question about Rupa Sunar but about caste discrimination that has dragged our society down for centuries. Many have similarly been denied rooms in the Valley. But this is still not an issue just of the Valley or a certain community. This is a representative story of the discrimination that dalits have faced for centuries. Around four million dalits across the country were looking at the issue with hope that they would for once get to experience that the equality granted by the Constitution is not merely an empty promise but actual right that can be exercised without any fear or retribution. Minister Shrestha has added insult to injury of these millions of dalits. The woman may be pardoned using myriad of arguments or acquitted by the court in lack of concrete evidence. But the crime that he has committed in capacity of the representative of the state cannot be pardoned. He deserves punishment for that.     
We urge the prime minister and ruling CPN-UML to either fire Minister Shrestha or formally swear allegiance to the caste system. There will be no need to make noise expecting democracy and social justice from this dispensation after that. The dalits will also have no illusion about equality or expectation about social justice, and may perhaps disabuse themselves of the rosy interpretation of the Constitution.

The G7 summit held in person at Carbis Bay in the United Kingdom past weekend made for an interesting viewing from Nepal. Leaders of the seven rich and liberal democracies of the world frolicked maskless at the beach on the Atlantic coast even as virtually whole of Nepal is under prohibitory orders. The seven leaders, the majority of whom are over 65 years old with three septuagenarians and just two below 50, mingled without face masks even indoors and pledged more doses of vaccines to the global south. Indian Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi, invited as a guest country, virtually addressed the summit sounding a clarion call  for following a ""one earth, one health"" approach to effectively deal with the pandemic globally. Nepalis, rubbing their eyes in disbelief, watched the Indian media rave about how Modi lectured the world leaders about their collective responsibility toward tackling the pandemic globally. Some may even have felt that the leader with recent 'sage' makeover has had an epiphany and would lift the export ban of vaccines at least in the immediate neighborhood. But there was no such epiphany alas and India has yet to relax export ban at the time of writing this editorial.
All that frolicking and pomp was vulgar to see from Nepal where around 1.4 million older adults are hopelessly waiting for the second dose of Covishield vaccine over three months after getting the first one. Nepal started its vaccination campaign with the one million Covishield (AstraZeneca manufactured in India) doses donated by India just a few days after it was started in India. The government did not choose to inoculate the most vulnerable older adults with the doses remaining after inoculating the frontline health workers and opted to jab journalists, government staffers and bankers among others instead. Nepal opted for inoculating older adults only after paying Serum Institute of India for two million more doses and one million of them arrived. The government, despite all its ineptitude in handling the pandemic, was cautious even after the one million doses arrived and consulted the WHO before starting to vaccinate the older adults. It started to inoculate people above 65 years from the second week of March only after consent of the WHO. With well over one million doses in hand, advance payment already made to Serum for another one million doses and assurances that it will also receive its share of vaccines from the global vaccine alliance COVAX. Nepal even agreed to inoculate foreigners working in different diplomatic missions and international organizations in Nepal ahead of the older adults with assurances that there will be no shortage of doses. This was kind of generosity not even the developed countries showed toward foreigners at that time.
But as the older adults started counting down the eight weeks they were told they had to wait for the second dose, the second wave hit India hard. Serum, on instruction of the Indian government, refused to deliver the one million doses Nepal had already paid for and also to COVAX as it was obliged to. The government requested New Delhi to at least provide enough for second dose to the older adults but to no avail. Serum has to supply the doses after taking advance payment for the sake of ethical business practice. The Modi government should allow export of the doses on humanitarian grounds if not for the millennia of special bread and daughter relation with Nepal that he repeatedly invokes. The quantity, that has become a matter of life and death for Nepali older adults, is almost irrelevant for a vast country like India. It is not even half of the Covishield doses that Serum manufactures each day on an average and can be easily offset by smoothening the supply chains inside.
The older adults have to hopelessly wait even as the western media report that the delta variant, first seen in India and assumed to be the dominant even in Nepal, is significantly more contagious than other variants. Studies show that while two doses of AstraZeneca provide full protection against serious disease from delta variant, single dose provides significantly less protection against the variant than against the original virus. Britain initially had gambled to extend the gap for second dose of AstraZeneca from four weeks to 10-12 weeks to ensure more people have some level of protection instead of a fewer having complete protection and others no protection at all. But considering the significant risk of delta variant even for those receiving one dose, it has brought the gap to well below eight weeks. It is now rapidly inoculating younger Britons having all but finished vaccinating most vulnerable older adults.
In this grim scenario, the only option the Nepal government has for the older adults if it doesn't get AstraZeneca/Covishield vaccines is to provide two doses of Chinese or another vaccine. Some studies are being done in the West about giving Pfizer vaccine as the second dose after first dose of AstraZeneca and preliminary results show that such mixing indeed works. But the results are just preliminary and it will be too late for such mixing to be officially authorized for the vulnerable Nepalis who received the first dose three months back.
Starting a new kind of vaccine for the older adults would mean that 1.4 million doses of Covishield given as the first dose will be wasted. That would be unpardonable considering how precious and scarce the life-saving vaccines are. Nepal and India also have another kind of special relationship apart from the clichéd bread and daughter relationship Modi always invokes. Nepali men have fought for India for centuries and thousands have died protecting the Indian borders over the years. Thousands of Nepalis still serve in the Indian army. The Nepali older adults awaiting the second dose include many veterans who have served India in the past and may well be parents and grandparents of many who are currently serving the Indian forces. Not providing these doses would tantamount to wastage of all the one million doses donated by India and another 400,000 procured by Nepal.
India at least can point at the devastation wreaked by the second wave in defense of its vaccine nationalism. But the richer countries do not even have that excuse. America has tens of millions of AstraZeneca doses that it doesn't intend to use. With the country securing enough doses of Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines to inoculate the American people many times over, it has finally pledged to provide AstraZeneca to other countries. But it outrageously is waiting for approval of the Food and Drug Administration before supplying them to other countries despite it already being approved in those countries. America is the first country to have diplomatic relation with Nepal apart from British India and have invested billions in foreign assistance to Nepal over the years. It is baffling that America has not provided the AstraZeneca vaccines it won't use to solve the humanitarian crisis in Nepal.
Britain, like India, has special relationship honed over centuries with Nepal. It is troubling that Britain is not doing anything to avert the humanitarian crisis by supplying AstraZeneca vaccines developed there. Thousands of Nepalis have died fighting for the British Empire since their colonial rule in India. Selling AstraZeneca vaccines to Nepal to inoculate the older adults would be a small gratitude for the tons of Nepali blood shed for the British cause.     ,
Japan is another example. It has ordered 120 million doses of AstraZeneca to be delivered by September that it will not use on Japanese people in all likelihood. It authorized use of AstraZeneca around three weeks back. But it has yet to start its use citing the very rare instances of blood clots and has already secured enough of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to inoculate those aged 16 or older. Japan has tremendous goodwill in Nepal despite not being an immediate neighbor or a global superpower and Nepali people consider it to be the only donor with no strategic interest in Nepal. It is regrettable that Japan sits top on the pile of AstraZeneca vaccines, many of them reportedly on verge of expiry, even as those above 65 here in Nepal are in this hopeless situation. 
The communist government in its exuberance to please China may have rubbed Japan the wrong way in the past few years. There have also been murmurs from Japanese diplomats about the problem Japanese business folks face in repatriation of income generated here back to Japan. But that does not mean the Japanese diplomats, who have always been selfless friends for Nepal, should remain mere spectators to the humanitarian crisis unfolding here. We urge the Japanese Embassy to take initiative to allow Nepal to buy the AstraZeneca vaccines Japan does not intend to use if donating is too much to ask for in these troubled times.
The United Nations and health experts have been repeatedly pointing that no one is safe from this virus until everyone is safe but the rich countries despite paying lip service to that have been shamelessly practicing vaccine nationalism. It is criminal on part of rich countries to outbid and elbow out poorer countries with non-existent health infrastructure to secure enough vaccines to inoculate their people many times over and then allow the spare doses expire unused. It is obscene to bribe younger adults with joints and beer for vaccine when the pandemic has already waned there while even the frontline health professionals and the older adults in poorer countries in the midst of a surging pandemic cannot get the jab.
Vaccine delayed, like justice, is vaccine denied. But better late than never. The pledge of G7 to secure a further one billion vaccine doses for other countries over the next 12 months primarily through COVAX is welcome. But more is needed and needed today, not the next year as WHO Director General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus rightly says.  ""There are enough doses of vaccines globally to drive down transmission and save many lives, if they are used in the right places, for the right people,"" he stressed speaking after the G7 announcement. There are more than enough doses of unused AstraZeneca vaccines on verge of expiry around the world to provide second dose to the older Nepali adults. The international community with their collective conscience buried under the piles of unused surplus vaccines owe at least that much to Nepal.

The ever-increasing trade deficit of Nepal has crossed Rs 1 trillion. Balancing the economy has always remained a challenge for the government and having trade surplus remains a distant dream. The government recently announced a controversial plan to export sand, gravel, rocks and other materials to India to balance the trade deficit. This invited heavy criticism from all quarters including the political parties, environmentalist, and the non-governmental sector among others. Though the government denies that mining will be carried out in the Chure region, there is a big ethical question on whether or not to extract resources from any specific geographical region.
The vulnerability 
Mining certainly has some implications on the environment at local and regional scales. Any alterations upstream will bear upon the natural settings downstream, especially if the physiography is relatively fragile. This is the exactly the case of Chure region of Nepal which is unique in terms of its geology, geomorphology and ecology. Geologically it is the youngest mountain of the Himalayas comprising of unstable slope and unconsolidated rocks. The tarai section of the Chure is already prone to flooding and inundation. Chure Master Plan, the most comprehensive document so far for Chure management, shows that about 89,797 hectares of Chure falls under highly vulnerable category in terms of flooding and inundation. Likewise, 145,794 hectares falls in the moderately vulnerable category. With lack of management and unregulated mining, there is a risk of additional areas being pushed to the vulnerable category. These geo-hazards are further exacerbated by recent but unprecedented anthropogenic pressures like forest encroachment and degradation, uncontrolled grazing, forest fire, uncontrolled excavation of sand, gravel and boulders from rivers and streams in the Chure.
Among the several activities, mining in the rivers has remained the most contested issue over the past several years. Records show that there are 242 mining sites across 27 districts of Chure region. In addition, 136 potential mining areas have been identified. The reason for this scale of expansion of the industry is perhaps the revenue that governments collect. Statistics show that the Bagmati province alone collected over Rs 1 billion in revenue from the local government, majority of which came from mining taxes. The lucrative nature of this business has not only convinced the government to allow mining, it has rather promoted illicit collection and export across the border.
The illegal extraction has not only altered the topography of the Chure region including the downstream, millions of lives are in danger due mainly to their exposure to flooding events. Estimates show that 14 million inhabit the Chure region. Not limited to this, about millions of people live in the Gangetic plains, meaning any environmental modifications made in Chure will have a direct implication to far south in the Indian territories.
The Chure Master Plan has explicitly highlighted the fact that the initial environmental assessments are not adequately followed and that monitoring and regulation is equally weak. It further stresses that the amount of materials drawn exceeds the actually permitted amount. Technically, the rate of excavation of such mines should not exceed that of the rate of deposition. This has particularly been happening close to expanding market areas. For instance, areas close to urban centers likeTinau of Rupandehi, and certain areas in Bara and Dhanusha districts are a few examples of soaring mining activities, some in illicit ways.
Environmental impacts
Studies have shown that over extractions can have an array of environmental impacts. That ranges from impacts on the aquatic ecosystem, loss of land mass due to erosion, disruption in the waterflows thus triggering water currents, damages to infrastructures including bridges, all of which undermines the protection against flooding events.
The argument that extraction of gravels and boulders is reasonable as long as the sand/sediment budget and the hydraulic information is adequately considered. Indiscreetly, mining in Nepal has lacked scientific discernment compounded by the lack of capacity on part of the local bodies and administration to conduct environmental assessments and regular monitoring. Not only has this motivated over extraction of the resources, illegal collections and export across the border is rife. Dozens of illegal mining and export remains unreported across Nepal. This shows the lack of capability of the government to regulate the collection, thus in contradiction to its claim to sustainable extraction. Attack on the journalist reporting on illegal sand extraction in Abu Khaireni of Gorkha district, and murder of Prakash Mahato, an environmental activist protesting the illegal extraction in rivers of Dhanusha, on January 2020 are manifestations of the illegality in this industry. 
The question on sustainable mining
The demand for sand and gravel is ever increasing in the Indian territory. Even the major cities and peri-urban areas on the Nepali side has witnessed rapid expansion thus giving thrust to development priorities. With ever increasing demand for development materials, regulating the supply demand chain is a big challenge. Citing rising cases of illegal and unstainable mining, parliamentary committee had instructed to ban the export and mining in the Chure region in 2010 warning that the denudation would soon turn tarai to a desert. Nevertheless, imposition, and ease in the ban largely remains in the discretion of political leadership. 
Despite periodic bans on illegal mining from rivers, these go largely unchecked and unregulated in Nepal. Previous studies have highlighted the fact that the maps identified for mining in the initial environmental assessment reports is different from areas where extraction is actually done. More alarming is that in some cases, in defiance of the assessment reports, extractions have been carried out in areas that are flood prone and under risk of river bank erosion.
The expansion of tools and technology in the domains of mining is testimony to this flourishing industry. Records show 458 crusher industries operating across 37 districts. In 2017-2018 alone, excavators and shovel loaders worth Rs 19 billion were imported to Nepal. With this extractive policy, the questions always remain about sustainable mining.
 A transboundary issue
The impacts of mining can be traced beyond borders and in some cases leaves serious repercussions. For instance, Singapore is ravenously expanding its land over the seas. It is doing this through importing sand, gravel and other materials from neighboring states. The impacts of the sand export have already manifested in various countries but most notably is the disappearance of over 20 sand islands in Indonesia alone.
The point is there is never a limit to the demand over such resources. With neighboring states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh in India expanding rapidly, the demand for resources keep shooting up. Over 30 districts in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh usually suffer from flooding that emerge from the Nepali territory. That means India is also not spared from the detriments of the Nepali land, most importantly the Chure. As long as the mining and export ARE not checked through policies, regulations and effective oversight, there is always a likelihood of overexploitation. This would be more effective through concerted efforts of the governments across regions. Unsustainable mining across the Chure and the impacts it has across Nepal and the Indian territory demands for a joint effort. Joint assessments, monitoring, and conservation efforts between the concerned agencies in Nepal and India would equally be important to minimize the impacts of Chure degradation.

Nepal’s mountains and rivers are often praised as heavenly assets that attract tourists—foreign as well as domestic. However, Nepal as a country, which is located along the seismically active tectonic plate, lies in one of the world’s most disaster-prone territory. Given the topographical fragility of its steep terrain and young geology of Himalayas as well as ferocious rivers during monsoon, human settlements in their vicinity are exposed to recurrent disaster-hazards. Moreover, deforestation, haphazard extraction of Chure, lack of sustainable engineering on road construction, impacts of climate change, unplanned human settlements, weak channeling of budgets allocated for disaster mitigation efforts, dams, embankments and other structures built by India along the border as well as Nepal’s lack of diplomatic acumen to resolve this issue with India through talks, have aggravated the disaster risks.
It is unsurprising that Nepal, every year, records a massive loss of lives and property worth hundreds of million rupees to various disasters during monsoon. Besides, common monsoon disasters such as landslides, mudslides, lightning, flash floods, and inundations among others destroy critical infrastructures like roads, utility poles, schools and hospitals among others, leaving human settlements in peril, in many cases even out of humanitarian assistance. According to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority, last year alone between April and October, monsoon disasters claimed at least 463 lives—the biggest single-year casualty since the devastating earthquake of 2015—while as many as 803 persons were injured, 101 others went missing and property worth Rs 797.5 million was lost.
Nepal has continuously devised pre-disaster preparedness and disaster management mechanisms in tandem with international partners and local agencies over the years. In current federal restructuring, Disaster Risk Reduction and Management (DRRM) Act (2017) has made it clear that the National Disaster Risk Reduction Management Authority (NDRRMA) is the apex agency under the Home Ministry to work on all natural disaster risks management cycle—preparedness, response, rescue operation, recovery, relief or mitigation efforts—in coordination with local and provincial governments across the nation. Also, NDRRMA has to coordinate with the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology and the Department of Mines and Geology in terms of disaster warning systems to disseminate early alert messages to the public.
According to the rules, local levels, district disaster bodies, provincial bodies and national-level authorities are required to coordinate with each other to prepare the reports on disaster risks and mitigation efforts following the bottom-up approach. Based on a database of these annual reports, higher level authorities devise national plans at the end for disaster mitigation efforts which could be channelized throughout the three tiers of the government to tackle the disaster risks.
There is, however, still a huge coordination and communication gap among intra-governmental, non-governmental and private humanitarian agencies at all levels. Further, lack of clarity on how roles and responsibilities are shared among them has added to the woes.
Most distressingly, the efficacy of our disaster risks mitigation mechanism is questionable when it comes to enhancing disaster resilience capabilities of the hazard-prone communities.  When a community is faced with calamities like landslides, floods and inundation, there are always the most pressing concerns about potential loss of lives, economic impacts and untoward psycho-social repercussions. However, in terms of most monsoon disasters, landslides in the vicinity of weak hills and high hills as well as floods on the river bank settlements are always predictable in many cases. Such hazard effects can be remarkably prevented or mitigated with coordinated community mobilization. But we have largely failed to strengthen the abilities of communities to take meaningful, deliberate and collective actions both to prevent disasters and reduce the disaster impacts. We should understand the fact that if communities are resilient, they can come forward with strong civic leadership, coordinate with each other to engage in prevention efforts as well as generate organizational linkages to withstand disaster impacts such as social, cultural, economic including psycho-social support during the crisis.
This is mainly due to the fact that our disaster preparedness efforts are only focused on response soon after catastrophes befall. Throughout the year, all authorities remain almost non-functional and resort to dirty blame games when disasters wreak havoc on human societies. Even in the wake of disaster, they lack coordinated actions to extend the humanitarian services to the victims and relocate them to safer places.  What happened to Sindhupalchok and Baglung landslides victims last year is just the tip of the iceberg. Had the authorities responded on time, such a huge loss of lives and property as well as psychological impacts could have been significantly averted.
Furthermore, owing to the unscientific human settlement patterns and inflexible land use policy in the nation as well as inaction on the part of government agencies to respond with long-term relocation plans, communities are compelled to hastily reconstruct poor shelters on the same lines where disasters normally hit year by year. This only spares hazard-prone communities to witness another year’s catastrophes.
With this year’s monsoon around the corner and increased vulnerability of disaster-prone communities due to the pandemic crisis, it is utterly necessary to learn lessons from the past experiences and adopt the most possible pragmatic approaches to reduce the disaster risks.
It is clear that the hilly districts sitting in the Siwalik, Mahabharat range, Mid-land as well as higher Himalayas are more vulnerable to landslides owing to their steep topography and fragile ecosystem while communities within the basin of snow-fed perennial rivers such as Koshi, Narayani, Karnali, and Mahakali among other southern rivers are always at higher risks of floods and inundation.
Disaster preparedness remains an urgency to mitigate the plight of people in disaster-prone communities in hills and low-lands where natural disasters are invariably recurrent phenomenon with incessant rainfall in monsoon causing flash floods and landslides. Timely communication, coordinated efforts and dedicated actions among all levels of government agencies, humanitarian agencies, national security apparatus, private partners and communities are fundamental to strengthening life-saving approaches both before and after the catastrophes befall.
Moreover, this is also the prime responsibility of media to educate communities to enhance their disaster resilience capabilities and keep them alert on possible disaster threats.
Equally important is communities’ awareness to be prepared with disaster supply kit contents that include essential items such as stock of food that requires no cooking or refrigeration, safe drinking water, clothing, and first aid tools as well as necessary medication to sustain a family at least for a few days. This will help ease the disaster challenges that are often faced by vulnerable populations such as children and older adults including women, patients and differently-abled individuals. As each life is precious, it is never good to be unprepared for the worst that this year’s monsoon may impose on us.

The world is currently experiencing the threat of COVID-19, which has affected 220 countries and territories. Being a Himalayan country with complex landscapes, lax quarantine systems, under-resourced health care and public health systems, less capacitated diagnostic facilities, and a long open border with India, Nepal is on the brink of health care failure and severe risk from COVID-19 pandemic. The risk has already been evinced by severe outbreaks of COVID-19 in Nepal that ranks 18th  in active cases, 41st in total cases,  and 51st in total deaths (as of May 31). However, the data is supposed to be underestimated due to limited testing, and lack of case tracing are common in Nepal.            
Some measures were adopted initially to prevent the COVID-19 outbreaks, such as nationwide lockdown, closure of academic institutions and all entertainment and sports avenues, implementing travel restrictions from affected countries and borders. However, all of those measures were poorly implemented; Nepal experienced growing cases of COVID-19 despite being controlled. Reviewing the global scenario shows the COVID-19 outbreaks have been linked to the country’s public health, economic, political, and social systems. Thus, these systems should be understood to determine the appropriate preventive and therapeutic strategies of the pandemics.
The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the fragility of the country's health system, inequalities, and poor governance. The second wave likely driven by B.1.617.2 variant, that is reported to be highly contagious, aggressive, and fatal, has led to mass fear on the Nepali people. As of April 30, 2021, all of the as intensive care unit (ICU) wards in all of the private and public hospitals were already occupied with serious cases of COVID-19. It is a pity to see that healthcare workers provide their best services to COVID-19 patients despite being infected themselves. Many city hospitals have already run out of the necessities such as ICU beds, ventilators, oxygen, and drugs used in COVID-19 treatment. Hospitals close to Indian border have experienced massive cases of COVID-19, and this harbingers the worst situation in future if further integrated activities are not performed soon. This has been aggravated by flocking of a large number of people from India into Nepal through the porous borders, and the government not being able to control such movements. This has raised a serious threat to the introduction of new viral strains into Nepal. There is no hope of health facilities including PCR tests and others for the rural and disadvantaged people, especially in the high altitude areas with difficult landscapes. These are the underlying causes why COVID-19 patients are not traveling to the hospitals and thus are hidden from the government statistics. One can argue that overwhelming hospital attendance, strained and exorbitant health system, health services fatigue, and the resource constraints predict an even worse situation in the coming days.
 Who is to blame?
The main question regarding the second wave is who was to blame. Health workers and public health experts had already warned the government of the possible tsunami of the COVID-19 due to new viral variants. They urged the government to ramp up efforts to upgrade hospitals, arrange ICU beds, and get vaccines. Although COVID-19 Crisis Management Center (CCMC) frequently advised the government to take precautions, plans, programs, and policies related to the future outbreak, the government turned its blind eye to engage experts and use data and science and follow the public health advice. On January 28, 2021, when no death was reported for the first time after the start of first wave, health care authorities and government believed the COVID-19 epidemic was under control, were complacent, and did not prepare for possible future outbreaks. Thus, the government did not carry out border lockdown for Nepali workers and people celebrating religious/cultural events returning from India or Indian people who flew from Kathmandu to other countries by air. From the first COVID-19 wave, the government was busy concentrating on other political affairs such as infighting in the ruling party, dissolution of parliament, demonstration of power via rally, restructuring Cabinet at the central level, toppling the governments at the provincial level, and lobbying to pass the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) Compact. The opposition parties also did not care about the pandemic as thousands of their cadres also participated in rallies and programs. While the government prohibited gathering of more than 25 people, the prime minister himself attended many public events for inauguration, political speech, and religious ceremonies, surrounded by hundreds of mostly unmasked people. In addition, politicization, false information, rumors, claims, and advocacy in social media fuelled the non-compliance, conspiracy theorists urged the general people to not follow the preventive and control measures against COVID-19. For example, PM KP Sharma Oli's hearsay regarding guava leaf therapy, turmeric powder therapy, spicy therapy, and the so-called theory of naturally immune Nepalis do not have any scientific pieces of evidence. It was highly criticized by politicians and non-aligned scientists. However, he blamed Nepali people for their negligence when the second wave hit, and then, he touted his government, claiming everything is under control, indicating his hunger for self-ennoblement. In the meantime, there are reports of corruption in the purchase of essential medical supplies and vaccines against COVID-19. This has resulted in the growing anxiety and frustration among citizens regarding the government’s healthcare and economic response to the pandemic. Therefore, the PM seems to defend his government, hiding its moral failure, apathy, incompetence, and corruption regarding COVID-19 control.    
Nevertheless, it was a welcome move of the government to make a plan to inoculate all of its citizens by the end of April 2021 beginning the vaccination campaign in January.  As of March 15, 2021, 1.6 million people or less than 6 % of the eligible population had received single dose of vaccine while more than a million older adults have not got their second dose of Covishield well over two months after receiving the first. It was interesting that when PM Oli was machinating to dissolve the House, the US Senate Foreign relations Committee discussed about vaccine shortage in Nepal. The recent announcement of Chinese President Xi Jinping to provide a million doses of vaccines to Nepal indicates a critical worry advocated about Nepal by the emerging leaders around the globe.  
Recommendations 
While the second wave is engulfing the country, Nepal should fight with it based on scientific evidence and medical experiences. First, it should learn a lesson from the experiences of countries like New Zealand, South Korea, Taiwan, Israel, and others on how to effectively apply control and preventive measures and promote equitable vaccine distribution. Policy, which prioritized economy rather than public health in few countries like USA, India, Brazil, and others, led to the failure. Therefore, efficient and wise leadership in the current situation in Nepal is mandatory. Second, considering its capacity, Nepal should focus and invest more in the early detection, identification, and containment of viruses at the community level in all seven provinces. For this, the central government should mobilize the microbiologists, biotechnologists, zoologists and health workers via a fast-track employment system and work with health centers at the local level. Third, the government should welcome and facilitate travel permits for those individuals, groups, charities, or organizations who want to support COVID-19 patients as well as other patients. Thousands of Nepali people are volunteering delivery of the patients to the hospitals and providing primary care or quarantine centers, oxygen cylinders, antibiotics, and drugs. For this, Nepali people around the world are also playing essential roles. Fourth, a healthy collaboration of the government with different line ministries, different political parties, and prompt application of the advice given by the CCMC is essential. Awareness programs regarding vaccine hesitancy and COVID-19 management via proper use of media are critical and can be conducted by following the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. Fifth, the government should have aggressive contact tracing, epidemiological and molecular studies to better understand circulating variants and their epidemiological features and to implement effective control measures.
Nepal should also talk to authorities in India about the establishment of temporary isolation centers and the closure of border entry. Sixth, in vitro as well as in vivo research using natural products, drugs, and vaccines related to the treatment and preventive strategies of COVID-19 should be conducted. Seventh, the government should implement mass vaccination as well as non-pharmaceutical interventions such as universal masking and social distancing, which have been proven successful in controlling the viral spread. It would also be better to provide alternative approaches such as deferring the second dose to accelerate and maximize vaccination coverage to the susceptible population, as practiced first in Britain. Eighth, a 'vaccine passport' or 'e-vaccination certificate' should be regulated at least at the international airport so that only the fully vaccinated individuals are allowed to enter the country. Finally, Nepal, whose current health expenditure per capita is only US$ 45.5 needs the international community including the WHO to help her combat the pandemic. How successfully Nepal defeats COVID-19 depends on the responsible leadership and public health interventions by the government.

Harvard professor Steven Pinker, in a scholarly deliberation, subtly describes the reasons behind political rhetoric tending to be “vague, empty and bland”. For this, not only the politicians but also the audiences play their part equally as both are hypocritical in political messaging. It is because, he says, “there is firestorm when the leaders speak substantive”. In our context we can imply that a leader would not be able to draw attention of voters or people or win their support if s/he speaks reality in terms of what actually s/he can perform or is performing. To fill this void s/he speaks tall promises, vague and empty ideas that look like real with a lot of glitter to generate wow from the audience. The media, instead of focusing on substantive information, always “yearns for spotting gaffes the politicians commit when there is not horse race”, Pinker further observes. Framing and spin-doctoring techniques are widely applied in generating and spreading unsavory ideas as part of the political rhetoric, he argues.
Rhetorical tricks
If we minutely go through Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s political steps and subsequent communicative actions, it would be pellucid how rhetorical tricks have entirely corroborated the actions taken to secure his stay in power and capture all state machinery including constitutional bodies. Knowingly or unknowingly the media and the audience have been the prey of incessant logical fallacies from Oli and his entourage. Unless we realize this communication perspectives of today’s polity, which is truly represented by PM Oli and his cortege among others, our efforts to cope any undemocratic move would be unavailing. 
Nepal’s republic system has so far witnessed eight PMs and two presidents. History would judge their distinctive traits and performances. All chief executives shared some short of common traits as to compromising democratic values and delivering below par, although to a varying degree. Oli, however, has painted a discrete picture, though not pleasant. When assuming the top office three years ago, Oli’s aura as the premier of almost two-third majority and as a chair of historically the biggest communist party of the country was astounding. In the beginning, the design of development and prosperity he mapped out were worth drawing attention to for every single Nepali who was either working as a blue-helmet worker in a gulf country or suffering from multiple problems ranging from unemployment to social injustices here at home.
Initially, many compelling ideas and slogans Oli articulated one after another kept on beating the media headlines. He orchestrated different strategies to establish what he had done was right and up to the mark. Later on after people began to seek true delivery from his administration rather than lofty promises, he gradually either ignored or diluted his failed attempts by attributing to other factors such as opponents in his party or foreign elements. While he busied himself to meet foreign agents, enhance his propaganda drives and take steps accordingly, he, side by side, accused his opponents of using these weapons against him. If we look at the shreds of political moves taken by Oli we can find a spiral of attempts he made to justify his every other step.  As part of his attempts to create his self-respect and urgency in the power, he opted for two weapons. First was the announcement or initiation or inauguration of developmental projects, almost all of which were devoid of substantiated foundation or progress or far behind from completion. Second was the rhetorical tricks he and his team used to justify his every move through various types of logical fallacies. Essentially, this article focuses on the communication traits he and the President’s Office made to justify the dissolution of the parliament and announcement of the elections on November 12 and 19.
Either me or nobody attitude 
Oli uses a lot of emotional appeals with selected phrases and imageries that can evoke a sense of urgency or compulsion in his action. Other contemporary leaders look diminutive to Oli in utilizing humor and wits. Side by side, he, at times, uses threats eliciting a sense of fear that the country and democracy will fail if his path was not adopted. How can going for the fresh mandate when no one is being able to garner required support to form a new government be autocratic move? Apparently, this question he put forth looks plausible for general audience. However, there are numerous counter questions that invalidate his idea: Is going to election by violating the letter and spirit of the Constitution appropriate? Can elections be held in free and fair manner when he has managed to take state organs including the constitutional bodies into his grip? Is it the right time to go for elections when the entire country is unprecedentedly suffering from a pandemic (COVID-19) when the parliament still has nearly two more years to complete its tenure? Instead of addressing these questions rightly, he and his team members are now busy to dilute them with ersatz ideas and partial or misrepresented truths.
Following the House dissolution, Oli, in a press meet, said that he opted for the dissolution, for the opposition alliance could neither form the government nor did it support him by giving him vote of trust in the parliament. He also tried to justify his move saying that he wanted to clear the way to form a new government under Article 76(5). His arguments do not carry any merit as they contradict on what he did in real action. Not only did he claim for new government under his leadership under the same Article for which he had “cleared the way for new government”, he also created a pseudo situation that led him to dissolve the parliament and go for elections. Oli, for this, adopted two tactics: presenting claims to the president that he has the support of required number of parliament members and creating a pseudo situation where the president could invalidate the claims of both the candidates—Oli himself and leader of the opposition alliance Sher Bahadur Deuba. Instead of clearing the way for the new government, these tactics cleared the way for himself to invoke the Article 76(7) for dissolving the parliament and go for mid-term polls–his ultimate goal to cling on to power and vanquish his opponents.
President Bidya Devi Bhandari’s logic that some of the lawmakers’ support to both the candidates made her invalidate both the candidates clearly appeared to be shallow and unfounded. Essentially, Deuba had appeared with signatures of more than the required numbers of lawmakers whereas Oli had just made the claim that he has the support from more than the required members by ignoring the fact that a significant number of the lawmakers from his own party CPN-UML and Janata Samajbadi Party had already revolted from their respective parties and supported Deuba. As the protector of the Constitution, Bhandari was supposed to verify the signatures by taking some time to clear her doubts so that the House of Representatives could be saved. Instead of bothering to fulfil this duty by taking some time, she dissolved the parliament and announced the fresh polls on Oli’s recommendation. It is obvious that she just served Oli’s interest by trampling all merits and reasoning against the move.
BR Ambedkar, after India’s Constitution was drafted under his leadership, said, “. . . however good a Constitution may be, it is sure to turn out bad because those who are called to work it, happen to be a bad lot. However bad a Constitution may be, it may turn out to be good if those who are called to work it, happen to be a good lot.” Nepal is now going through a situation when the current lot (bad lot) in the power is solely responsible for the ongoing political turmoil and focus on politicking rather than devastating pandemic.
Fighting evil spirits
Oli will be remembered as a chicanery chief executive of democratic federal republic Nepal as he managed to use tricks and deceits in justifying his actions and create a false reality. Some of such traits comprised spending a lot of time, mostly in his almost solo deliberations, with preferably the media and journalists lenient to him; tactfully framing phrases that apparently show his actions taken either out of compulsion or urgent need of time; attacking opponents with abhorring, stinging, sardonic and belittling comments and analogies; parroting political rhetoric such as nationalism, national interest, democracy, transformation, corruption-free society in speeches but acting against them in actuality. The political parties need to revamp their internal system and nourish democratic exercise so that wrong people would not prevail to not let the history repeat itself. Emboldening public opinion against any such pernicious character from the politics is equally important. This demands efforts, either concerted at organizational level or at individual level; from the media, civil society members, research organizations and academics.
Fighting the evil spirits is no doubt tough as they are well-equipped with resources and their dogmatic supporters or ‘cyber troops’ through which they attack the opponents and whistleblowers or dilute the facts against their interest. However, it is not impossible as we all citizens can ventilate our voice through various communication channels. Since we don’t have to wait for or rely on others to make our voices heard as we are readily accessible to various communication channels with enormous intensity of diffusion, we can hone these weapons, wield them against the wrongdoers and attack them by spreading facts, exposing their self-serving tricks, creating debates over the merits and demerits of public affairs and carrying out valid researches from academic and other sectors. As Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple Inc. once said “it’s really clear that the most precious resource we all have is time”. We are living in the time of highly sophisticated communication and technology through which we can work a lot to demolish any despot. So, let’s beware of glittering claims, cunningly framed speeches or stories and doctored information. Let’s not forget that the time is ours!

Prime Minister (PM) KP Sharma Oli has again attacked the Constitution and democracy after his first blow on December 20, 2020 failed. The motive is clear—to shred the Constitution into pieces and derail democracy.
He has full support of President Bidya Devi Bhandari in this motive. Not merely support, both of them are together in this motive.  President Bhandari, therefore, threw away the written application submitted by  149 House of Representatives (HoR) members to form an alternative government as per the constitutional provision on Friday, and dissolved the HoR on recommendation of Oli.
The flimsy arguments President Bhandari used to usurp the constitutional rights of 149 lawmakers makes her motive clear. Issuing a statement in the midnight, she claimed that their claims were unjustified taking help of the false claims made by Oli. Oli had sent a letter to the President less than 24 hours earlier saying he has paved the way for formation of new government pointing he does not have confidence of the House.
She issued the notice saying claims of both Oli and Nepali Congress (NC) President Sher Bahadur Deuba are unjustified pointing at the false claims of Oli that he now has majority. She reasoned that the supporting lawmakers are repeated on both sides, they have supported candidate of another party against the party's decision, and the parties concerned have written to not recognize their signatures.
These arguments are false and baseless. First and foremost, President Bhandari's claim that the names of supporters are repeated is a blatant lie. None of the 149 lawmakers who signed to make Deuba the new PM have signed in favor of Oli. Oli rather had submitted a false letter lying that he has full support of all 121 CPN-UML lawmakers and 32 Janata Samajwadi Party (JSP) ones. Thirty-eight out of those 153 had signed in support of Deuba.
So much so that Oli implied that UML leader Madhav Kumar Nepal and JSP leaders Upendra Yadav and Baburam Bhattarai, who were present in person while submitting the application supporting Deuba to President Bhandari, supported him.
Any lawmaker can sign supporting any other lawmaker who wishes to become PM under Article 76(5) of the Constitution. This provision has been kept in Article 76(5) of the Constitution precisely to ensure that any lawmaker who can muster support of majority lawmakers can form the government after the majority government, coalition government of two or more than two parties, and minority government of the largest party in the House all fail. If party whip were to be binding, there would be no meaning of keeping Article 76(5) of the Constitution.
The logic that President Bhandari gave pointing that Deuba could not be appointed PM as lawmakers have supported candidate of another party against the parties' decision, and the parties concerned wrote requesting her to not recognize those signatures, therefore, is groundless.
Let us assume for a while that a lawmaker cannot support lawmaker of another party or an independent candidate without decision of the party concerned even under Article 76(5) of the Constitution, and the party whip is valid and the Act related to political parties is attracted.
A lawmaker can defy the party whip not just in the context of Article 76(5) of the Constitution, but in election under any other article of the Constitution, or any other issue. That is counted as a valid vote in the House. That vote is not annulled. A lawmaker always has that right as a sovereign representative elected by the people.
The lawmaker definitely can be punished for defying the party whip, and can even lose the post of lawmaker as per the Act related to political parties. But there is no provision in the Constitution or any law in Nepal that stops a lawmaker from voting defying the party whip, or annuls the vote so cast. 
Even if the lawmaker who signed in support of the lawmaker to be appointed PM under Article 76(5) of the Constitution were later to be punished in accordance to the law, our Constitution or law of the land does not grant any right to the President to reject the vote cast when the person is legally a lawmaker.
She could have verified authenticity of the signatures if she had any doubt. She could have even summoned those lawmakers to march at the President's Office within 24 hours and asked them to sign in person to establish whether the majority of lawmakers supported Oli or Deuba.
But she did not want to do that because that would have exposed Oli's lies. That step would have been against the motive she shared with him.
The whimsical attitude of Oli would have largely been reined in if President Bhandari had followed the system right from the beginning and complied with the Constitution. She continued to further nurture his growing whimsical attitude instead. She is, therefore, one of the main reasons behind the the current whimsical nature of Oli and his habit of taking arbitrary decisions on whims.
We should also not forget there is a very strong external dimension to the path against the Constitution and democracy that Oli has taken. It will metastasize further the more we delay to understand and publicly challenge that. Many had suspected right from the beginning that the outside hand was in play in dissolution of the HoR even on December 20. The maneuverings of the external powers have come to the fore after the House was reinstated.
They are openly operating to keep Oli in power in recent times. They first advised the main opposition NC to not form an alliance against Oli and later resorted to threatening language. They did everything to woo, threaten and split JSP lawmakers to support Oli. Why are they doing all this for Oli?  
Chief of the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) of India Samant Goel had arrived on an Indian Air Force plane while Nepal was in lockdown seven months back. He had a meeting with PM Oli at Baluwatar in the midnight without any representative of the Foreign Ministry. Records of even telephonic conversations of the US President with a foreign head of the state or government are kept. The records of the in-person meetings of US President with any foreigner are also kept. But there is no such record of the talk between Oli and Goel.
The Indian stance toward Oli suddenly changed after that midnight meeting. Oli unconstitutionally dissolved the House on December 20 without any reason just two months later. What if the conspiratorial attack on the House and Constitution Friday midnight was a result of that Oli-Goel meeting?
The way the Indians are working in recent times to stop formation of an alternative government and dissolve the House gives credence to such suspicions. This has also led to another suspicion. What is the Indian roadmap? How can one believe that the election will be held in November?
The country is reeling due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Thousands are testing positive every day while the daily death toll has hovered over 150 on average for more than a week. No one can say when the pandemic will wane. Some experts fear that we may be swamped by the third wave even before the second wave recedes. It is difficult to believe that an election can be held amidst such raging pandemic. There are not even grounds to believe that Oli intends to hold election. The Constitution will be in doldrums if the election cannot be held.
It's well-established that India does not like this Constitution or the House that amended the Constitution to incorporate the new map including the Nepali territories encroached by India. The strong CPN that it abhorred has been shattered due to division of CPN. Are these the objectives of India or is there more?
The history of many countries testifies that democracy and Constitution and democracy of small neighboring countries do not have any meaning in comparison to the ego and interest of big countries. There have been precedents that even existence of some small countries have not mattered before the interest and ego of these big countries.  
Therefore, we must also be aware and vigilant about this external dimension while preparing to fight this arbitrary action of Oli. But there is no need to be frightened.
Our own history testifies that no despot or the external powers can do anything if all the citizens come together. This is the one lesson we should take from the Janaandolan II.
The struggle against the Oli's blatant attack on democracy and Constitution will be long and difficult. But it is the people who will ultimately prevail. The people have emerged victorious in every movement in Nepal right from 1951. The relevance of certain individuals for external powers is transient and they are ruthlessly disowned when their relevance ends. The external powers cannot continuously back an individual pushing the people aside for long even if they were to wish so.   
The first battle in the struggle against Oli's attack against democracy and Constitution is the legal fight. The 149 lawmakers whose constitutional right to elect the new PM was denied should immediately move the court.
This case is less complicated that the ones lodged after the first dissolution. The Supreme Court in its verdict while reinstating the House then has explained the process through which the Article 76(7) can be exercised to dissolve the House establishing the rights of the lawmakers to provide an alternative government through Article 76(5) of the Constitution. The majority lawmakers should go to the court demanding that very right President Bhandari has usurped.
The battle to bring the Constitution and democracy on track should start from there. The rest should be gradually waged after that.

The deep political division in the recently formed Janata Samajwadi Party (JSP), which claims to represent the ethnic minorities across the hills and plains of Nepal, seems to have befuddled the political crystal gazers of Kathmandu.
The Mahantha Thakur-Rajendra Mahato faction of the JSP threw its weight behind Prime Minister (PM) KP Oli in a recent vote of confidence in the parliament, neutralizing the possibility of forming an alternative government by opposition parties.
Thakur, despite his penchant for nepotism, is a respected political figure and claims to represent the Madhesis who feel excluded by the exclusionary nature of Nepali nationalism based on hill ethos. Oli, on the other hand, is at another extreme of the political spectrum who is perceived to have thrived on the same nationalist rhetoric.
The Thakur-Mahato faction has defended the move by claiming that the withdrawal of cases against those implicated in the Madhesh violence during the political transition is a proof that Oli has addressed the demands of the Madhesis “at least partially”, and that he cannot stab Oli on the back by joining an alternative government.
But declining to take charge of some lucrative ministries in Kathmandu is something that hardly makes sense for ethnic parties that tend to be highly dependent on clientelistic politics for political survival. Now the question is: does the Thakur-Mahato faction have an alternative vision for its political survival?    
The second puzzle is the low profile of an otherwise hyperactive Chinese Ambassador to Nepal Hou Yanqi even as Nepal seems to have headed for an uncharted political territory – something that Beijing could have perceived as concerning for its security policy on the periphery in the changed geopolitical context. This is also in stark contrast to the previous wave of pandemic when she had raised hope of an adequate flow of Chinese medical aid to Nepal if required. The second wave of pandemic is now sweeping across the country, hospitals are running out of basic medical supplies, grieving families are mourning loved ones laid on funeral pyres, and social media walls are full of obituaries. Yet, ambassador Yanqi is no longer seen holding meetings with Nepali politicians in their residence in Kathmandu depriving the Nepali media of speculative stories about potential “Chinese plot to replace India in Nepal” that often send chills down the spine of Babus in New Delhi and invite knee-jerk responses from the Indian media to the delight of Twitterati in Kathmandu.
Nor is Nepal clearly seeking help from China for medical supplies despite Oli’s presence on CNN to draw the US attention to the unfolding crisis in Nepal and his subsequent article in The Guardian appealing to the UK government for immediate help. China is perhaps in the best position to help Nepal at this moment, though both countries are our important partners and the US has, in particular, significantly helped Nepal. Yet, Oli made no such appeal to China which may have otherwise been obliged to respond to this crisis more effectively. Our prime minister’s open letter for help to a country that is seven seas apart, despite our historic ties, while ignoring the next-door neighbor must have baffled the Chinese who are increasingly embroiled in a major power rivalry and disputes over the initial handling of the pandemic. Equally baffling and shameful was a letter sent by Nepal to India a few weeks ago, seeking medical help such as oxygen supplies when India itself was reeling under acute oxygen shortage.
What do these two puzzles have in common, anyway? Putting these two pieces of puzzles together may provide a better picture of the big puzzle that is the Oli regime and may explain several other Oli moves that are puzzling even for those who have long been observing Nepali politics and society closely.
Oli seems to have taken a new political turn from at least the time of Nepal visit by Samant Goel, chief of India’s intelligence agency Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) last year, as reported by several media outlets. Interestingly, Oli has maintained total silence on the disputed issues between Nepal and India since their meeting and the new so-called pointed map of Nepal has vanished from the official discourse. It appears that Oli’s rapport with the Indian PM Narendra Modi was facilitated by the network of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a militant wing of India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), leading to his transformation from a violent Leninist to a disciple of lord Shiva who defies the basic logic of science during pandemic. There are indications that he hopes to rule Nepal through a dominant party built along the image of BJP.
Leaders from the former Rashtriya Janata Party (RJP)—such as the Hindu high caste leaders of the JSP like Thakur, and other like Mahato—look eager to embrace Oli as coalition partners in the new game of Hindu politics. It is worth recalling that the RJP had shown a dubious commitment toward secularism before it merged with its former rival in the plains, Federal Socialist Party, Nepal. In fact, Madhesi parties are already in trouble and are looking for ways to make a comeback.
Without full political support from JSP to an alternative government, Oli however seems confident that the country would head for fresh elections. Not surprisingly, another ardent supporter of fresh elections is Kamal Thapa who wants to revert Nepal to a Hindu kingdom. With these potential coalitional parties, Oli hopes to sweep elections in the Madhesh while maintaining his support in the hills that have long remained a bastion for communist politics.
This should explain why the Indian sadhus furiously attacked Oli when he first declared that Ram was born in Thori of Nepal, but have remained silent over the dispute in recent times. The only plausible explanation is the ideological evolution of Oli from Marxist-Leninist stalwart to Hindu nationalist.
Not surprisingly, Oli seems to be in a hurry to inaugurate half-built concrete structures or the structures that will perhaps never be built. His government inaugurated 165 strategic roads without conducting environmental impact assessments and detailed project reports, and 306 hospitals that have been inaugurated but mostly forgotten since then. Much louder is his inauguration of yet-to-be-completed Dharahara that lit up the night sky amidst a deadly pandemic. After all, Hindutva and development are two pillars of Modi politics that Oli seeks to emulate in Nepal. And, after his rapport with India, Oli is following India’s China policy in Nepal, too – that is keeping China out if its security perimeter, the Himalayas.
The RSS imagines Nepal a part of the Akhanda Bharat (indivisible India) and have traditionally drawn inspiration for politics of Hindu state in India from Nepal. The Modi regime feels more vulnerable to the growing influence of the post-pandemic China in its periphery. But, as the second wave has totally paralyzed India, Oli could be a useful person to minimize the potentially growing Chinese influence in Nepal.
With the help from India, KP Oli also seems to have snatched away the agenda of Hindu politics from former king Gyanendra and is using to shore up support for himself. But political strategies, however sound they may look, often fail. After all, the Hindu king himself was dethroned in Nepal, though one may argue that the context has significantly changed now. In contrast to what happened in India, Nepalis do not have any enduring collective memory of foreign invasion or occupation. Nor do we have the trauma of massive religious violence or partition of the country. But, religious violence could be a convenient way to mobilize the majority especially in the run up to elections, as evidence from India shows. Hindutva politics may fail in Nepal and may even prove to be a joke, but that doesn’t mean that it will not push the country toward religious violence and authoritarianism. But the immediate concern is that the geopolitical game seems to have paralyzed us from taking help from all other countries including China.

The Maoist insurgency for many women was one of the most horrifying nightmares and continues to be the one. They had to face gross human rights violation such as sexual violence and rape. Conflict Report, 2012 states that more than one third of these victims were below 15 at the time of crime. Such bitter experiences of women continues to affect different aspects of their lives today.
For some women, the incidents of them being sexually abused and raped were known to others too because they were raped in front of their children, husband, and other members of family or friends. Some of these women now face further violence and denial from their families and social stigma from their communities. For some, their husbands have asked them to leave saying they no longer are suitable to be their wife. Such discriminatory behaviors from family and community scare many other women to talk about sexual violence committed during the conflict. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 2016 recorded 316 complaints related to sexual assaults, the least number of complaints among all categories. However, many reports such as Conflict Report, 2012 by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), Thematic Report by TRIAL International, 2020 claim the number to be much higher because such cases remain much under-reported.
Tribunal Report, 2018 by WOREC states that in lack of state mechanism, the female survivors of conflict continue to live with trauma. The case studies collected by WOREC and reviewed for writing this article show that being sexually abused during the conflict has resulted in deterioration of the mental and reproductive health conditions for women. At present, they experience severe mental health issues such as post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, insomnia, loss of appetite, and pessimism about living itself, leading to suicidal thoughts. On the part of their reproductive health, many of them have developed reproductive health issues such as multiple miscarriages, uterine prolapse, infection, wounds in the uterus and uterine cancer. Nepal lacks proper mental and reproductive health services at the local level, making treatment inaccessible even in such life-threatening health situations.
The faulty policy provisions and inadequate livelihood-related programs, lack of accessible health services, and patriarchal social norms have mainly created hindrances on these women's way to transitional justice in Nepal. We neither have adequate laws nor are those justice providing mechanisms serious. The TRC Act 2014 provides the possibility of amnesty even in the cases of grave human rights violations, including sexual abuse and rape. Due to fear of social stigma and the possibility of familial disowning, many women have not yet spoken up about being sexually abused during the war, which means significantly fewer cases of such incidents is included in national data. Because of this, the survivors of sexual violence couldn't access any of the state's relief support though conflict affected them severely. Similarly, we do not have mental health and adequate reproductive health services at the local level.
To resolve the issues of survivors of sexual violence committed during the conflict, the government should focus on developing a unique mechanism in registering and investigating cases. There should be a justice mechanism that guarantees the privacy and protection of those who file the complaint. Survivors of sexual violence cannot present proofs, nor can they identify their perpetrators in most cases. Therefore, their statement should suffice to register the case and start an investigation, and the process should be handled by trained service providers, including female staffers. The provision of amnesty should be removed from the TRC Act. It is also the state's responsibility to design economic support programs and vocational training to support their livelihood. A well-resourced health institution at each ward and the facility of a counselor for mental well-being are required. The cases that the Truth and Reconciliation Commission have registered should be taken immediately into a fair and unbiased investigation for providing justice to the survivors and punishment to the perpetrators. Further violence and stigma against survivors of sexual violence are due to deep-rooted patriarchal mindsets and unequal social norms. Therefore, community awareness programs have to be integrated with all other initiatives for reintegration of the survivors.

During the first two months of this year, I worked as one of many doctors vaccinating people in the UK thus helping deliver COVID-19 protection to the elderly and the vulnerable. I returned to Nepal this month and wondered how reactions to the vaccine differed in the two countries. People in both often express concerns about the safety of a vaccine which has been produced so quickly. Usually vaccines take years to develop and yet a vaccine for COVID-19 was launched within a year of the identification of the COVID-19 virus: surely safety was compromised! Is this the case and how vaccines have been made so speedily?
Generally, any new vaccine or medicine during development goes through a sequential series of trials for efficacy and safety. If at any stage it is found to be ineffective or dangerous, development ceases and no more money is spent on it. In the case of COVID-19 vaccines, pharmaceutical companies ran many of these trials parallelly. The correct normal procedures were still followed without cutting corners and compromising safety. The reasons that pharmaceutical companies don’t usually do things this way is because of financial risk. In the case of COVID-19, various national governments financially supported a range of pharmaceutical companies allowing them to produce the vaccines speedily but safely and thus mitigate this financial risk. Numerous different vaccines were in development in many countries at the same time, and inevitably not all were successful. The vaccine that was being researched in France by Pasteur Institute, for example, proved ineffective and production ceased. Pasteur could not recoup any of its costs through vaccine sales, but the company was cushioned by government support.
There has been a lot of discussion about which vaccine is ‘best’; efficacies have been quoted as highest for the Russian Sputnik vaccine and also the Pfizer and Moderna products at over 90%. The AstraZeneca or ‘Oxford’ vaccine, which is the type that is being rolled out in Nepal, appears to have slightly lower efficacy. This has led to claims that this vaccine is being dumped in the third world. However, this is the vaccine that is being given to most people (>70%) in Britain and it seems to have an excellent safety profile.
It is important to remember that few vaccines give 100% protection against any specific disease. Even those that do so in theory, may fail if the cold chain is broken or there are other problems in delivery. Many vaccines have relatively low efficacies. For example, influenza vaccine is 40 – 60% effective, BCG probably around only 50% efficacious while typhoid is about 65% with zero protection against paratyphoid. It is difficult to say what the efficacy of the AstraZeneca vaccine is as it is so new:  it is at least 70% with one study suggesting it was 81% after a single dose. While studies in Scotland showed that administration of just one AstraZeneca dose reduced hospital admissions by 94% compared to a reduction of ‘up to 85%’ for Pfizer. The immune response to the vaccine depends on which strain of the virus is circulating, whether an absolute protection is quoted against even mild disease as well as serious and deadly cases, the amount of vaccine given, the dosing interval and probably also the age of the person being vaccinated.
Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are reported to have good efficacies (above 90%) but need to be kept frozen at very low temperatures (-70°C and -20°C respectively) making the risk of vaccine spoilage real, especially in a region where there are frequent power cuts and poor transportation facilities. The AstraZeneca vaccine is more robust and just needs to be kept in an ordinary fridge.
China’s Sinovac is being rolled out in Brazil, Turkey, Indonesia, Singapore and other countries and, while its efficacy is reported to be the least good of all the vaccines, it is still above the 50% required for regulatory approval. Although it does seem to have a relatively low efficacy against preventing all symptoms, importantly it appears to be powerful in preventing severe disease and death. Despite having an efficacy that may be lower than other vaccines, this will still help protect us all when large numbers of people are vaccinated. It is sad that there is so much discussion about which vaccine is ‘best’ and that this has become a political issue or a matter of national pride. French President Emmanuel Macron was inappropriately critical of the successful British AstraZeneca vaccine perhaps partly in reaction to the failure of the French vaccine. It is important that as many of us get vaccinated as possible. Politics should steer clear of this, except perhaps to curb profits. Pfizer are reportedly making 80% on each ampule of vaccine it sells while AstraZeneca is distributing at cost. Let’s accept whatever vaccine is being offered and listen to WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Gebreyesus who repeatedly says that “none of us is safe until we are all safe.” By this he means it is a global priority for as many people to get jabbed as is possible, and let us not worry about theoretical efficacy comparisons.
Safety, of course, is a different matter. The very high death rates in the UK has stimulated a good response from the government and more than a third of the British adult population has been vaccinated to date. That’s more than 22 million people. In Nepal, some elderly people and those with medical conditions worry that the vaccine may harm them since perhaps they think that their bodies are weak but the UK program started with such elderly people (including the 94-year-old Queen and her 99-year-old husband Prince Philip) and people with multiple medical conditions because they are at greatest risk of dying from COVID-19. The people of Nepal can be reassured that UK citizens have done an excellent and reassuring safety trial!
As a routine, vaccinators (both in Nepal and the UK) ask people about allergies and other medical details although there are a very few reasons not to have the vaccine. There is no problem for people with multiple medical conditions including diabetes, high blood pressure, cardiac or kidney ailments taking the vaccine. It is probably best avoided in pregnancy and anyone with multiple severe allergies (particularly those causing collapse and needing hospital admission) should probably take the vaccine at a health post or hospital.
In the UK, patients went straight home after receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine but were asked not to drive or cycle for 15 minutes. Short-term side-effects after the vaccine are to be expected and are reported in more than one in 10 people. Side-effects seem to be more common in younger rather than older people (over the age of 65) and in women more than men. Most people have a slight local pain at the site of the injection. People who take blood-thinners might expect a little bruising at the site of the injection, although the needle is very fine. (I take blood thinners but did not experience this problem) Some people experience body aches and fever but only for a day or so and paracetamol helps those who are feeling uneasy. A few feel quite unwell for nearly a week after receiving the vaccine, but this is a small cost for protection against a potentially fatal disease.
Let us all keep each other safe by accepting the vaccine when it is offered and continuing mask-wearing and maintaining social distancing until we are all vaccinated. The governments have briefed the people but increased dissemination of accessible information by it and major stakeholders would reassure the public and improve trust.

In many countries around the world, volunteerism is leveraged to help achieve societal changes and, as a complementary tool to public policies implemented by the government, it plays an important role in alleviating pressing problems faced by the people.
You can find volunteers in action in every sector from conservation efforts to humanitarian support for those who are in most need.
Nepal boasts a vibrant civil society, and solidarity and altruism have been unique features of the country well before even the term “volunteerism” was introduced here.
We have seen how during the pandemic, volunteers in Nepal like in many other parts of  the world got activated in multiple ways, from the production of personal protective equipment (PPE) to feeding those groups within the society who have been most affected by the lockdowns.
Now the country has a unique opportunity to bring volunteerism to the next level thanks to the formulation of a draft National Volunteering Policy that, once finalized and approved by the federal government, could herald a new era for the sector.
Prepared by the Policy Research Institute or PRI, a government-led public think tank, the draft policy is a key document that envisions the enabling conditions for volunteerism to better contribute to the national development process.
With the ongoing economic crisis stemming from the pandemic forcing governments and civil society alike to re-think their traditional socio-economic models, there is no doubt that volunteerism can play a big role.
Globally there has been an effort, led by the United Nations Volunteers (UNV) to broaden up and modernize the traditional boundaries and categories of volunteering action, acknowledging, very importantly, the existence of a so-called “continuum” that goes from more informal traditional forms of altruism that are so strong in many rural areas of Nepal to more organized forms of volunteering.
The draft policy being worked out by PRI under the leadership of Dr Bishnu Upreti, is wide-ranging and encompassing this multifaceted nature of volunteerism in the country.
With an ambitious vision of “developing volunteering program in the form of effective medium for the social, cultural and economic transformation of the country”, the draft also calls for further legislation that can codify and strengthen volunteerism in the country in future.
The Philippines, for example, is one country in the Asia Pacific Region that has a solid volunteering infrastructure with a legislation and an appropriate supporting system provided by the government.
It is exactly what the draft is calling for because without involvement of the federal, provincial and local governments--whose role is well recognized in the document--it will be impossible for Nepal to fully expand volunteering opportunities for all.
This is why the fact the draft envisions a National Volunteering Promotion Center is so paramount.
This is the institution that ultimately would play an indispensable role in enabling citizens from all walks of life to embrace volunteerism ensuring positive social outcomes.
We need to ensure that such institution is going to have the necessary resources and institutional autonomy to become the key national actor in promoting and facilitating volunteerism.
Interestingly the draft policy will enable volunteerism as a springboard to equip youths and older working-age citizens alike to find and create employment opportunities.
With Nepal aiming to graduate from the least developing status, it is indispensable to have innovative tools to promote new skills that will be meaningful in the job market and volunteerism is definitely one of them.
The drafters were also innovative in recognizing the role that non-resident Nepalis could have in promoting volunteerism because the national diaspora, if properly cultivated, could have a big role in helping develop the country by engaging in well-formulated and planned volunteering activities.
The facilities envisioned by the draft are in this sense progressive also because they try to bring clarity and legitimacy to properly managed and, most importantly, effective volunteering efforts by foreigners, an issue that has always been sensitive.
Ensuring a strong National Volunteering Promotion Center that perhaps could be renamed in a way that would give it a stronger mandate, beyond just promotion, is vital.
For example it could be named National Volunteering Council, an institution that the draft for now describes the highest level decision making committee in matter of volunteerism as.
Chaired by federal Minister for Youth and Sports with participation of Social Development Ministers of seven provinces and the secretaries and other top policy makers, such council, the draft states, will coordinate with another body, the Volunteering Program Implementation Committee that will itself supervise the National Volunteering Promotion Center.
At the end of the day, no matter the names to be given to the different institutions in charge of volunteerism, what counts is to have a well-resourced but also at the same time lean and agile implementing body that, while fully accountable to the policy makers, will be capable not only to supervise and monitor but also enable strong and effective volunteering activities.
The stronger such body is, the more chances the sector will have to prosper and thrive with better social outcomes on the ground.
The fact that the draft also calls for such body to coordinate a web portal managing the supply and demand of volunteers bodes well for the sector.
This is important because volunteering, as well-stated by the draft policy, can have positive effects also on the education sector, equipping students with new learning and serving experiences that will enrich their learning process.
Having local units or volunteering centers under the supervision of local governments could be another fundamental element to truly enable an effective system that facilitates citizens, including the most vulnerable ones, to contribute to national development, helping Nepal achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.
Last but not the least the process that led to formulation of the draft has been even more interesting because it was based on a real collaboration that saw an innovative public research institution partnering with civil society organizations, all passionately involved in promoting volunteerism, with the UNV as a key facilitator and enabler.
The fact that such partnerships have been enabled could itself be the best practice.
Now it is up to the citizens of Nepal, not only activists and practitioners, to get engaged and ensure that draft can be improved.
Discussions, on the ground in all the seven provinces and also virtually, are being held to ensure that the draft document can get the attention that is due and also the much-needed feedbacks and suggestions.
The country has a unique opportunity to achieve the Agenda 2030 by leveraging volunteerism. Best of luck Nepal!

I was 12 or 13 years old when I was lucky enough to have the opportunity to join a remembrance tour to some concentration camps across Austria and Germany.
It was an experience as shocking as transformational for me and I do still vividly remember walking around the Dachau camp, one of the biggest and most deadly among all the extermination sites across Europe.
The fact that the Embassy of Israel, the Embassy of Germany, the Delegation of the European Union to Nepal and the United Nations in Nepal joined hands to commemorate the victims of the Holocaust is significant also for Nepal.
Because, though very far from here, the deliberate attempt at suppressing and exterminating one entire civilization and culture during the World War II, should remind us at the same time how vicious human beings can turn out to be but also the spirit of forgivingness that can help us heal and become better persons.
Indeed, the Holocaust is a universal story, the biggest tragedy faced by our humanity and at the same time, it is a great example how victims and perpetrators can come together in a spirit of peace and reconciliation.
It is a story not just about what Jews had to endure not only during the World War II but also in the years before that, crucial years in which anti-Semitism grew exponentially, day by day, throughout Europe, fueled by harsh rhetoric that at the end normalized hatred and led to millions being killed.
Unfortunately the seeds of what happened then might, tragically, lead us to more tragedies now fueled by a hatred toward others that are just different from us.
Instead of getting rid of racism and discriminations, the era we are living through is more and more bogged down by misconceptions, stereotypes, charged emotions against particular minorities, a phenomenon echoed by a pervasive social media that have been working as echo chambers to disseminate disinformation and falsehoods.
Remembering the Holocaust in Nepal is important because at its roots there is a fundamental racist view of the world that comes from ignorance, fear and insecurity.
Unfortunately there is no country around the world that is immune from these and while it is true that a genocide is something monstrously different from any other type of crimes that happened so far in the modern history, there are links and common points between all types of violence based on discriminatory attitudes.
Though it can take different forms and shapes, at the core of the enabling factors that led to extermination of millions of Jewish people is a view of the society that somehow some are better than others, that some are deemed to be the culprits of existing problems even though the underlying rationale of such accusations are totally baseless.
We should be extremely careful to draw comparisons of what happened in Europe between the World War I and events in other parts of the world.
Encouragingly now there is an international legal framework--there is a convention against racism, there is the international convention upholding human rights universally and there is much more awareness about what can lead to a genocide.
And yet we are witnessing how racism including anti-Semitism is spreading in Europe and in North America, where even a recent football game in Milan had one of the most successful football player mocking with a racist remark his opponent, also a remarkable and extremely talented athlete but with a different skin color.
One thing can lead to another and we should be really careful to condone small remarks, even those that are being made unconsciously.
It is from these subtle discriminations that stronger and more vocal forms of racism originate, kicking off a sort of snowball effect that can truly lead to more serious forms of crimes, including violence.
Education against racism, against the pre-concepts that are inborn in each of us, education for a better understanding is indispensable.
That’s why the fact that the Higher Institutions and Secondary Schools' Association Nepal (HISSAN) has joined the official commemorations on what is officially called the International Day of Commemoration in Memory of the Victims of the Holocaust also known internationally as International Holocaust Remembrance Day is important.
Civic education plays a key role in shaping students’ view of their country and the world.
Patriotism is definitely an important element of civic education but discussions about it should not set aside talks about other aspects that can make a country not only great and prosperous but just.
As an European I am encouraged by the actions being taken by the European Commission to fight anti-Semitism and other forms of racism but as someone deeply in love with Nepal, I also would like to see schools and colleges around the country to better embed their civic education classes with elements of social justice, human rights, all elements that are the foundations of what this country is aspiring to become.
In this there is no country that can really teach others on how to model the perfectly equitable and just society.
It is going to be “a work in construction” everywhere and we can all learn from each other.
My dear friend Michael Rosenkrantz who for several years has been living in Nepal and who had many family members killed during the Holocaust, shares to me:
“There is still anti-Semitism in existence because people are very tribal. It’s not just about anti-Semitism but is just a general dislike of others who don’t look like us”.
We often relate to each other more for our differences than for what we have in common. We can see how this is pervasive in the United States and in Europe as well.
Perhaps as human beings we are wired for this but I believe we can always be better and the way Germany has embraced its moral failures during the World War II is exemplary.
No genocides have been committed in Nepal but discrimination in many forms is still rampant.
Nepal has a real opportunity to instill positive and universal values among its youths to lay the foundation for a better nation.
Having one week of awareness about the Holocaust as it has been planned by the organizers of the Holocaust’s commemoration this year is going to be important but how can we attach more meaning to the concept of active citizenship, one that does a better job at internalizing the principles enshrined in the Constitution of this country with its quest for peace, harmony and justice?
While it is true that Nepal has been progressing on its human rights agenda, the recent universal review of its human rights performance also shows that there are still many gaps, not only at the policy level.
My visit to Dachau shaped me in so many ways.
Talking about the tragedies of our past generations, even if they occurred far away and decades ago, can help us become better and truly push for a more equitable, just Nepal, a country that can become a paragon for upholding human rights.

Prime Minister (PM) KP Sharma Oli has once again been isolated after bringing the controversial ordinance about Constitutional Council.
PM Oli on April 20 had also issued an ordinance allowing appointments at constitutional bodies through majority of the Constitutional Council. He had also brought another ordinance allowing splitting of political parties with support of 40 percent in the central committee or parliamentary party.
He had stepped back after widespread opposition from within the ruling party and outside, and decided to withdraw the two ordinances four days later.
PM Oli has again issued the ordinance about the Constitutional Council with the same provisions eight months on. President Bidya Devi Bhandari has again hastily authenticated the ordinance that was not even discussed in the Cabinet like then.
The Constitutional Council Act requires presence of four members apart from the PM who chairs the council for quorum. Oli has issued the ordinance with a provision that allows decision with support of the majority of the existing members. This means three members can now hold the meeting and take decision. In other words, it has paved the way for PM Oli to take decision in presence of the chief justice (CJ) and the National Assembly chairman.
The Constitution envisions presence of all three organs of the state and the main opposition party in the Constitutional Council to ensure that the government does not make unilateral appointments in constitutional bodies. The Constitutional Council chaired by the PM therefore includes chief justice (CJ), House speaker and deputy speaker, National Assembly chairman and the main opposition leader.
PM Oli by bringing the ordinance has effectively ousted the main opposition leader and House speaker from the Constitutional Council rendering them redundant in appointments in constitutional bodies. This is a coup d'état by the PM on Constitutional Council against the spirit of Constitution.
This arbitrary step has once again isolated the PM in Nepali politics. The ordinance has been roundly criticized inside Oli's party and outside.
The main opposition Nepali Congress (NC) has made its stance against the ordinance clear. The main opposition leader Sher Bahadur Deuba has not attended the Constitutional Council meeting convened Tuesday evening after the ordinance was brought. He has revealed that he had warned that NC will not support if Oli were to bring an ordinance.
PM Oli did not consult inside ruling CPN before bringing the ordinance. Ministers have said the issue was not discussed even in the Cabinet meeting held before it was issued.
The other Chairman of CPN Pushpa Kamal Dahal has already demanded immediate revocation of the ordinance stating that it has been brought without consulting the party. Other CPN leaders have also publicly slammed the ordinance. Janardan Sharma, who is close to Dahal, has called the ordinance height of the self-interest of government. NC Vice-president Bimalendra Nidhi has called issue of the ordinance totalitarian and autocratic step. He has commented that this has blatantly attacked the Constitution and system.
Oli, who has been cornered inside ruling CPN, does not seem to be in the mood to step back this time despite widespread condemnation of the ordinance. He seems to have taken the confrontational step after Speaker Agni Sapkota took the decision to not attend Constitutional Council meeting after consulting with Dahal and Senior Leader Madhav Kumar Nepal.
Deputy PM and secretariat member Ishwar Pokharel, who is close to Oli, has commented that the ordinance has been brought as the Constitutional Council has been stuck without capacity to do any work. But this step by PM Oli does not look right either on the crucible of practicality or the spirit of Constitution.
Oli, who is in acute minority inside the ruling party, seems determined to make appointments in constitutional bodies by staging the coup on Constitutional Council. He seems to see political benefits for him even if the party were to split.
But he has grossly under-estimated the harm this step can do for him. This step will further boost the anti-Oli environment inside CPN. By taking an arbitrary step of this extent for his personal interest, PM Oli has justified the efforts inside the party to oust him.

The issue of freedom of expression frequently comes up for discussion in Nepal. Rapper Samir Ghising (Vten)’s newly released song titled “Paara” has once again dragged freedom of expression into the discussion. On October 29, 2020, Nepal Police Headquarters had directed the Cyber Bureau to take legal action against Vten stating that his song ""Paara"" contains indecent language which is contrary to public decency. While the Cyber Bureau was searching for Vten, he approached the Patan High Court against the order of the Police Headquarters. The Court on November 3, 2020 granted interim relief to Vten ordering the authorities not to arrest him. However, it is not the first time that rappers and singers have been arrested for allegedly spreading indecency in society. Vten was apprehended around the same time last year for using ‘anti-social’ words in one of his songs. The Nepal Police had also arrested singer Durgesh Thapa around the same time last year after he was dragged into controversy due to the words used in his song titled 'Happy Tihar, Chiso Beer’.
Public opinion always gets divided as to whether these forms of arrest or action against the artists or citizens in the name of spreading indecency in society are appropriate or not. In the issue of the recent incident of Vten, some people say that his song “Paara” contains certain words that a decent person would hesitate to use even in a private place because those are not regarded socially acceptable and are likely to encourage disharmony and indecency in society, arguing that the action, therefore, is appropriate. Whereas others believe that everyone has the right to exercise the constitutionally guaranteed freedom of opinion and expression and that everyone has the right to choose whether to listen or not. They insist no one should, therefore, be penalized for exercising their right of opinion and expression.
In regard to the question of freedom of expression in the context of Nepal, the words of Justice Sapana Pradhan Malla are worth remembering: “The freedom of expression guaranteed by the Constitution and law is not absolute freedom. The obligation thereof is annexed with that. Such rights should be exercised in such a manner that such exercise would not harm any person or community and that it would not hurt the self-respect of anyone. In a diverse society like ours with multiple castes, multiple languages, and multiple religions, special consideration should be given while exercising the freedom of expression.”
The freedom of opinion and expression is subject to certain limitations--one of the limitations is that it should not be contrary to public decency and morality. The Constitution of Nepal discourages the expressions of indecent matters in public by explicitly stating that the freedom of opinion and expression which becomes contrary to public decency or morality can be restrained by making appropriate laws. Our society is a pluralistic society--yet people live in harmony and unity because one group respects the norms, values, beliefs, etc. of another, one person respects another person. If someone uses slanderous and libelous words against another person even in private, such acts are against law and are punishable under the laws of Nepal.
Whenever the discussion on freedom of expression arises, some people seem to be defending the alleged act by referring to the government and law enforcement agency’s inaction toward control of other crimes like corruption, rape, etc. Such defense may be practical in some circumstance as they outline the weakness of the law enforcement agencies, but does not seem logical. It is like saying that someone is free to beat people or steal money because another person has escaped punishment on the allegation of murder. The paucity of effective measures of law enforcement agencies to control one nature of crime cannot be an excuse for escaping punishment for another crime. If people begin to develop such a belief, it may lead the society toward impunity for grave crimes. The question is whether we desire the rule of law or impunity to exist. The beauty of democracy is, of course, the rule of law. If certain acts of a citizen qualify the criteria of an offense, it should be punishable as per the law.
As a common instance in the matter of freedom of expression, we can take reference of how our laws regulate the screening of movies or broadcasting media. Under the laws of Nepal, any movie to be released undergoes a censor screening prior to release because it is going to the masses and has the capacity to influence them. If any movie or any part thereof is found to be jeopardizing law and order or harmonious relation among people or causing negative impact to the public interest, decent behavior or morality or defame any person or encouraging the violence against women or incitement to commit any offense, such movie would not be permitted for screening as per the Motion Picture (Production, Exhibition, and Distribution) Act. Similar consideration goes with the broadcast media. It seems that the intent behind the censorship is to protect the ultimate interest of the people at large. Some years back there were no YouTube, or Facebook/Twitter, or other social media platforms. There were only radio, television, and movies that were required to follow certain protocols including the requirement of filtering of offensive or indecent contents if any. At present time, YouTube and other social media platforms are preferred over the radio, television, or movies. The YouTube videos or any other social media outlets put disclaimer at the beginning of the content. The mere presence of the disclaimer, however, does not limit its reach and influence toward the younger people or children. This gives a clear understanding that social media like YouTube also requires effective regulation in order to minimize the negative impacts in the society as well as to avoid such arbitrary arrests of artistes or citizens in the name of spreading indecent contents over social media.
Everyone is entitled to exercise freedom of expression. At the same time, one should also be able to measure the possible impact toward the public at large, more particularly the impact toward the children. The exercise of rights should go along with the obligations to abide by the Constitution and the laws. What is normal for one section may not always be acceptable to another section of the same society. The common point, therefore, should be encouraging the commonly accepted matters or reaching a commonly agreed point, if possible. If reaching a commonly agreed point is not possible, avoiding the controversial and divisive matters would remain an option. To end this controversy or have an agreeable solution to this discussion, there is a need for laws to regulate these matters. The balance between the rights and obligations would only take society toward the direction as required by the laws of the land. As the citizens are the ultimate reformers of society, we should always be mindful of our rights as well as obligations.

When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, thousands of Nepali migrant workers working in India returned home to be with their families during the challenging time. After exhausting their savings and sensing limited to no employment opportunities in their home country, they have now begun returning to India, with better hopes for jobs there. On a completely different note, India recently banned onion export owing to its domestic shortage. This ban resulted in a massive price hike in the Nepali market. Given the Nepali people's preference for Indian onions over the Chinese onions, the price will continue to rise until India relaxes the export. These two isolated examples paint only a small picture of Nepal's (inter)dependence on the Indian economy, which often gets noticeable attention in the debates concerning Nepal-India relations. What often remains under-stressed is the people-to-people relations between the two countries. While negotiating the 'special' relationship between the two countries, leaders often forget that the Nepal-India bond is more than a relationship between Delhi and Kathmandu. Its fate cannot be decided merely by political elites.
Earlier this year, Vice-chairman of ruling CPN Bam Dev Gautam expressed his desire to build a five-meter tall wall along the Nepal-India border. Given the issue's sensitivity due to the recurring border disputes, strict restrictions along the border may appear to many as a logical response. However, the romanticism of such harsh measures ignores the ground reality of thousands of Nepalis living along the border, whose livelihoods depend not just on Nepal's amicable relationship with India but also on the open Nepal-India border. The flow of people and goods between the two countries is so vital for the survival and everyday lives of the people living in the border regions that no border control measure ever completely shuts the nuanced dynamics of the border. This has been evident during the coronavirus-related national lockdowns of the two countries. Although the border remains 'closed' officially, people who live near lesser-known and informal border points continue to visit their families and shop from the towns across the border. Such cross-border activities are unavoidable necessities of the people, which even the deadly pandemic has not been able to tame. National debates on the Nepal-India relationship and border control fail to consider such complexities and nuances of the cross-border dynamics.
A vital component of the nuanced Nepal-India border dynamics is the region's sociocultural composition and history. Despite the redrawing of the political boundary between the two countries after the 1816 Sugauli Treaty, the sociocultural boundary comprising of southern Nepal and northern India continues to exist. The people of this region have so much in common—from the religious practices and festivals to languages, costumes, lifestyle, and even the caste system—that cross-border marriage is still prevalent, particularly in the Madhesi community residing in the southern plains of Nepal. Such marital relations mean families and relatives on both sides of the border. In fact, the practice is so common that almost every Madhesi family has at least one family member or a relative across the border. Depriving thousands of people of their access to their families in the name of national security and border control would be an assault on their rights and an insult to their sociocultural identity, practice, and heritage. Madhesi people wishing for Nepal's cordial relationship with India and less restrictive border mechanisms is no surprise or coincidence.
Another important factor that national debates on border control usually overlook is the informal economic activities along the Nepal-India border. While the open border allows people of the two countries to freely move and work without having to worry about visa and work permits, it has special significance for the Nepalis living along the border. Informal trade of goods between Nepal and India, mainly through smaller border points, is no secret. Several factors such as availability, price, brand, accessibility, and proximity lure Nepali customers to the nearest town across the border to import goods as essential as food and fertilizer. Similarly, Nepali farmers often take their goods to the nearest Indian town for better price or simply because that is their most convenient option. Therefore, the open Nepal-India border has established complex economic activities; aiming to shut the border completely would hamper the people in unprecedented ways. A good example is the strict regulation against the import of fertilizers, which has created chaos among Nepali farmers. Although establishing necessary border mechanisms to control the illegal flow of goods is essential, making decisions that directly impact thousands of people's lives by ignoring the true extent of their dependence on such economic activities will prove counterproductive.
The Nepal-India open border has its challenges. Apart from the occasional border disputes, either between the two governments or between the communities, the open border invites a set of security threats to Nepal, such as illegal immigration, smuggling, human/girl trafficking, terrorism, and other criminal activities. However, Nepal should not view these threats as a welcome indicator to completely shut the border and, in the process, hurt its own citizens and harm the long-existing 'special' relationship with India. Instead, it should sit down for dialogue and propose joint measures to tackle the challenges because these security threats affect both the countries. Nepal's increasing strategic importance in the region provides it with the necessary leverage for significant positive changes.
Border disputes are neither new nor surprising phenomenon. It occurs almost everywhere in the world, where two or more countries share boundaries. As a landlocked country sandwiched between India and China, Nepal is prone to this problem too. Due to Nepal's political history with India, a long border with India, and a higher population density along the Nepal-India border, Nepal's disputes with India are more frequent and visible than those with China. But there  Chinese construction in Nepali territory in Humla. However, such disputes should not direct the course of a country's relationship with its neighbor. As a small country, Nepal's sensitivity regarding its territorial integrity, sovereignty, and national security is well justified. However, what is unwise is Nepal's preferential treatment of its one neighbor and a deliberate distancing of the other, especially when it has severe consequences for its people. As discussed above, the Nepal-India relationship is more than a mere diplomatic association between the two countries. Before making any decision that further tarnishes the people-to-people relationship between the two countries, therefore, the political elites should consider their implications for the people.

Medical students and young doctors are Dr Govinda KC’s most ardent supporters. But as Dr KC is on his 19th fast-unto-death with his usual demands for medical education reforms, young doctors and medical students are protesting against the Medical Education Commission (MEC), the apex medical education regulatory body in the country, which Dr KC compelled the government to form. The commission’s first Common Entrance Exam (CEE) scheduled for October 13 is now the biggest source of despair for the majority of doctors in the country as it cruelly discriminates between government and non-government doctors.   The National Medical Education Regulation published on August 10 reserved 40% of all post graduate (PG) seats for doctors working in government institutions including those working in contract. Another 10% is allocated to foreigners leaving only 50% of the post graduate seats in open category. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Health refused to issue no objection certificates (NOC) to doctors working in government institutions in contract to ensure that all 40% of seats is reserved for permanent government doctors. The Ministry is now threatening to withhold funds for post graduate education in public institutes if these reservations are given to anyone except their employees.    There are currently 150 odd eligible permanent doctors who can appear in the CEE this year compared to nearly 10,000 non-government doctors. The 40% represents 450 PG seats which means there will be three seats for each permanent government doctor (The unfilled seats reserved for government doctors will be passed on to open category). This regulation and cunningness of the Ministry of Health at behest of Government Doctors Association of Nepal (GODAN) has effectively reserved 40% of all post graduate seats to 1% doctors. This distribution is unfair, unjust, restricts meritocracy and will erode quality medical education in the country.  Policy Corruption  The regulation was originally slated to reserve only 20% of PG seats to government doctors, which would still yield one and half seat to each permanent doctor. However, with undue influence from GODAN, the bureaucrats at the Ministry of Health, who were involved in revising the regulation upped the reservation to 50%. GODAN is the official organization of doctors working under the Ministry of Health. Hence, this provision was effectively revised by the Ministry of Health officials to benefit other employees at the ministry. Some of us protested after their deceitful plan of 50% reservation was leaked to public. It was lowered to 40% and included the doctors working in contract in the reservation category after that. Dr KC on the 10th day of his current fast added increasing open seats to 70% to his list of demands.  Government doctors are some of the better paid doctors in the country with plenty of financial incentives and opportunities for growth. They are better compensated for the work they do compared to others. There is absolutely no justification for reserving nearly half of all seats in public institutions for government employees.   People get offended when public roads are blocked for a few minutes for VIPs. Imagine half of all the roads being reserved for vehicles of government employees all the time. This is exactly what the regulation has done to post graduate medical education. This is one of the worst forms of policy corruption in the country done merely to benefit a few government employees at the cost of damaging the entire health care system in the country.   Other issues   The notice issued by the MEC regarding the exam is mired with confusion. A doctor competing in the exam in the open category can earn up to 10 points prior to the exam if he has served in rural areas. This provision will definitely encourage young doctors to work in rural areas. However, the regulation published a month back hasn’t given doctors any time to earn these points. Hence, it is only fair to apply this scoring system a few years later.   The MEC has also kept the seat distribution of MD/MS seats a secret. The regulation dictates that 50% of seats be allocated to open category but it doesn’t state how this distribution should be done. Foul play is further suspected due to the refusal of MEC to reveal the seat distribution. The matching system introduced by MEC replacing the existing open house counseling is also receiving stark criticism for being prone to manipulation and helping unfair competition. The open house counseling, wherein the top-ranked got to select a program first followed by the second-ranked and so on, guaranteed merit-based selection of programs. MEC’s matching system will provide successful candidates the opportunity to select and prioritize 25 MD/MS programs of their choice. With over 100 different MD/MS programs running across the country the matching system cannot guarantee merit-based selection unless candidates are allowed to select and prioritize every single program.
Consequences   The MEC has been the biggest source of frustration for doctors ever since its formation. The regulation, and the flawed notice in the recent times has added further pains during the time of COVID-19 pandemic.   The massive reservation for government employees will stifle opportunities for others leading to doctors pursuing medical education and careers abroad. Even now hundreds of doctors leave Nepal every year pursuing education and careers in the USA and the UK. In fact the 100 plus Nepali doctors who matched for the US residency programs for 2020 flew to the USA in chartered airplane in June in the middle of the pandemic. A study by the Center for Investigative Journalism (CIJ) has found that up to 60% of doctors who had studied MBBS under government scholarship leave Nepal for opportunities abroad. Policies like this will push more doctors in that direction  As the merit-based selection system is weakened, the quality of residency programs in the hospital will be severely compromised ultimately resulting in poor healthcare services. Also, as government employees are given free passes to post graduate seats, it will discourage hard work and incentivize mediocrity ensuring government-run health centers will always remain mediocre.  If this crosses over to other fields, it will totally ruin academia in Nepal. Imagine 40% of all post graduate academic seats in all areas reserved for the government employees!  Way Out  The field of medical education has always been the go-to field for opposition of affirmative action. Reservations for post graduate studies makes little sense in any field. There should not be any reservation in Post Graduate Medical Education–neither based on caste nor employment.   A fair merit-based system will foster a competitive residency program which will strengthen health care services. The MEC should only go forward with the exam after correcting the unfair and corrupt reservation in the regulation. It should be done swiftly so that the PG entrance exams which have already been delayed for four months are not pushed back much further.

""My objective was to ensure that those who want to know Nepal get to see the main views and know the main specialties of the country in a single book. I was, therefore, working on it for a long time,"" Thapa tells Setopati. ""Nepal is such a big country that it is not possible to include the whole country in 320 pages. But I have tried to include different possibilities of the country as far as I know in this book.""
He added that the book will be polished further in the future. 
The pictures in the books depict places from Olangchung Gola in the east to Kalapani in the Far West, Khaptad, Badimalika, Upper Dolpo, Lumbini, Janaki Temple, Shukaphant to the culture of the Kathmandu Valley. ""Most of the pictures in the book have been clicked by me. But I have not travelled across the whole country. I was undecided about whether to include the places I have not visited or not,"" he reveals. ""I finally decided that those places should not be excluded from the book even if I have not visited.""

For centuries, we Nepalis have dreamed of owning real estate before we retire. We may link real estate with prestige and a safe investment vehicle, which is why we want to possess it. We also wish to use real estate to produce passive income to help with our monthly or recurrent bills and relieve financial stress after retirement. However, a lack of liquidity, lesser cash flow (from rentals), expensive repair costs, and having to deal with tenants (both good and bad) can all be major roadblocks to landlords achieving their objectives. Real estate investment trusts (REITs) are financial structures used by countries such as the United States and India to hold real estate and avoid these issues. REITs, on the other hand, do not exist in Nepal, so Nepali investors are missing out on this potential.
First, let's understand REITs. They are companies that own or finance income-producing real estate across a range of property sectors and are mostly traded on the stock exchange. They typically own commercial properties such as towers, shopping malls, apartment buildings, hospitals, and care facilities, which create higher rental yields and an increase in value. They are required by law to pay the bulk of their taxable profit to their investors in the form of dividends (usually 90%). Dividends are given out on a monthly or quarterly basis. Let's look at some of the biggest concerns with real estate ownership and how REITs can help.

High-cost barrier to entry: Over the last decade, real estate prices have skyrocketed. Within a decade, a property purchased for Rs 300,000 per aana on the outskirts of Butwal has increased in value to Rs 2 million. It is really difficult for an average Nepali with an average job to acquire land in big cities, where prices start at Rs 1 million per aana. To be able to purchase them, you'll need to save for years. REITs are available for purchase at a fraction of the price of common or preferred shares on the stock exchange where they are traded. This will ensure that everyone will be able to invest in REITs.
Lower capital gain: Because we don't have REITs in Nepal, we can't make a direct comparison between their performance and that of real estate. Using data from the United States, which has seen a boom in real estate gains, we can show that REITs outperform real estate by a significant margin. As seen in the graph, Vanguard Real Estate ETFs (VNQ) returned 100.92 percent capital gain from 2010 to 2021, whereas the average real estate return was 44 percent throughout the same time period. Only four states have surpassed VNQ's performance throughout this time span.
Lower cash flow opportunity: One of the most lucrative aspects of owning real estate for retirees is the ability to generate cash flow or rents. As shown in the graph, REIT dividend yield beats total state rent collection by over 45 percent in the United States.

Even in Nepal, a Rs 40 million property in Kathmandu (identical to the one I'm renting for my office) brings in Rs 20,000 per month per floor. Two floors are rented out, while the third serves as a living area for the landlords. As a result, it earns Rs 40,000 thousand while saving you Rs 20,000 meaning Rs 60,000 per month, or Rs 720,000 per year. This is only a 1.8 percent gain. VNQ may create Rs 1.46 million per year and Rs 121,666.67 per month with the same amount of money at a 3.65% return - the amount of money needed to live comfortably in Nepal.

Risk management: While real estate is a low-risk, high-yielding investment, REITs diversify it and make it even safer. REITs own a variety of income-producing properties in a variety of industries. Even if one property or industry fails, they will still be able to make money from the remaining ones. It will, however, be extremely difficult for the average real estate investor to replicate.
Liquidity issue: Selling and buying property is a time-consuming process that takes 30-45 days from listing to closing, which can be troublesome if liquidity is required. REITs, on the other hand, can be sold with a single click and money deposited into your bank account within a week (at max).

In 2020, an investor who invested $135,000 in the United States in 2010 would have made $98,753.76 in dividends (73 percent return) and $135,000 in capital gain (100 percent return). At the same time period, a real estate investor would have made $26,668.39 in rents (19.75 percent return) and $59,710.5 in capital gain (44.23 percent), while being exposed to all the risks mentioned above. REITs investors (173 percent total return) would be 109.02 percent ($147,177) better off than investors in real estate (63.98 percent total return).
While there are dangers associated with REITs like fees, tax treatment, and investing in unsuitable or maturing REITs, they also provide an opportunity for investors to earn passive income while avoiding risks. In countries like the United States, many mutual funds and retirees have taken advantage of this to achieve early retirement or a safer retirement. REITs reduce or eliminate issues such as liquidity (in comparison to real estate, which takes time to trade), maintenance costs, and dealing with tenants, as well as lowering risk and providing increased cash flow, capital gain, and a lower barrier to entry. For investors, introducing REITs to Nepal would be a fantastic opportunity.

In almost all the polls conducted prior to the 2016 presidential election in the US, Hillary Clinton led Trump in every age group except one: Trump convincingly beat her among those 65 or older. Trump spoke of a time when America was supposedly great and told the country that he wanted to restore America’s greatness once again. His speeches regularly drummed up the anxieties of social change, the nostalgia about an imagined past, and the unfounded claim that there was an existential threat looming over America primarily because America’s culture was unravelling from within and there were external forces trying to take down America from without.
Perhaps that doesn’t sound too alien to Nepali ears because right now that is what we are witnessing from the elderly Nepali elites, especially those who have big presence in the social media—those ever ready to blame federalism, secularism, the new Constitution, the new republic, and anything in between for all things bad happening around them. The Nepali elderly elites—those who were able to reap the most benefits from the unitary, Kathmandu-centric, unsecular, nominally democratic system under the monarchy—want us to believe that if not for them, Nepal as a nation-state would no longer be existent on the map.
What explains this revanchist mood among the elderly elites? Writing for the popular psychology magazine “Psychology Today,” the psychologist and author Thomas Chamorro claims that, as we get older, our diminishing level of curiosity stunts our openness to experience; the gradual decrease in our information-processing capacity makes us see things in more categorical or black and white terms; and our desire for order and structure balks at proactive adaptation, effort, and improvisation. Further, psychologists have also pointed out that the moral values one grows up with or the worldview one is taught as a child plays a huge role on people’s notion of right and wrong, which often lasts for a lifetime. Perhaps, that partly explains why our elderly elites are dyspeptic about recent changes. In the Brexit referendum of 2016, for example, 72 percent of those aged between 18 to 24 voted “remain” but still lost to those who voted “leave” because people over the age of 65 had disproportionate impact on the referendum results.
“Despite young people having to live with the decision of the referendum for an average of 69 years, it has been decided for them by people who will only have to live with it for an average of 16 years,” wrote one graduate student for the magazine Vox. “Put simply: The long-term effect of Brexit will not be felt by those who overwhelmingly voted for it. Because they will be dead.”
Because the elders have less stake in the future of the country, they are skeptical about changes regardless of whether they are positive or negative, and are more inclined to look backwards, mostly to an imagined past when everything was supposedly hunky-dory. Whereas the youths, owing to their aspirations about the times ahead, are less fearful and more accepting of the social changes.
Young Bob Dylan spoke of this general trend in his song “The Times They Are A-Changin’” when he sang, “Come mothers and fathers/ Throughout the land/ And don’t criticize/ What you can’t understand/ Your sons and your daughters/ Are beyond your command/ Your old road is rapidly agin’/ Please get out of the new one/ If you can’t lend your hand/ For the times they are a-changin’.” Dylan wrote this song in the 1960s as an “archetypal protest anthem” when the Blacks in America were fighting for equal rights under the law.
The counterculture movement that developed in the Western world between mid-1960s to mid-1970s accelerated the Civil Rights Movement, the Feminist Movement, the Free Speech Movement and raised awareness against the traditional and mostly arbitrary modes of authority that directly or indirectly controlled people’s lives in the Western world.
To expect an equivalent movement from Nepali youths, however, would be to ask too much from them, for the youths in our country are mostly happy to remain as the ideological appendages of the elders, failing to carve out their own individual identity while inheriting the blinkered worldview that defines the hoary heads.
Unfortunately, our youths are happy playing monkeys in the streets parroting the boilerplate lines that flows from their leaders, obsessing with the latest brands of bikes, and vying for greener pastures in faraway lands at the first opportune moment. I bring this up because I don’t think this is so much an indictment of the youths as it is of their parents who have thwarted the critical thinking abilities of their kids.
“Enlightenment is man’s release from his self-incurred tutelage,” claimed Immanuel Kant, the eighteenth-century German philosopher—unfortunately, our parents (I include myself as well) haven’t received the memo even after these many centuries. The elder elites know that there will be no one to mount any challenge on their authority, not at least any time soon. Perhaps that too explains the solipsism, the puffed up feeling of one’s indispensability that we see in our elderly elites.
Before anybody accuse me of being a tradition-defying nihilist, here’s a blog What will the conservatives conserve? that I wrote a week ago which tries to show my appreciation of conservative values. However, the conservatism that we see in Nepal, I believe, is too backward, atavistic, and hence indefensible in so many ways. There is an urgent need to reimagine our national identity such that a vast majority feels included in the democratic process, and federalism and secularism provide us the mid-way forward. Of course, it may not be the only way, but it is the mid-way mark that we have reached to incorporate the voices of dissent that have festered in our societies for many years. We also need to keep in mind that if we are to forestall any demands on “multi-national autonomous states”(which I think will be disastrous for a country like ours) we need to find a middle ground around political principles like constitutionalism, the rule of law, and democratic accountability. In order to do that the elderly elites need to trust the process and stop sowing doubts in the population about federalism, secularism and the new Constitution. The Constitution must be seen as a living document that is amenable to change through amendments and will invariably do so toward forming a just and equitable Nepal.
In the lead up to the 2016 election in the US, an article titled “The Flight 93 Election,” authored under a pseudonym, made a huge splash in the conservative circles of the country. In it, the author had quite dramatically analogized the 2016 election to one of the planes, United Airlines Flight 93, that was highjacked by al-Qaeda terrorists on September 11, 2001, and had asked the readers what they would do under the circumstances? Whether they would charge the cockpit even though they didn’t know how to fly or land the plane, or they would simply do nothing—not even try—and wait for their deaths which was certain? For the author Hillary’s presidency meant that death was certain, whereas Trump’s meant that they would still have the chance of survival because it would mean that they had charged the cockpit and taken control of the plane even if they didn’t know what was going to happen next. The conservatives charged the cockpit, elected Trump, and floundered with the country for next four years. It seems that our elderly elites feel the same about federalism, secularism, and the new republic—they want us to think that if they don’t charge the cockpit Nepal will cease to exist. Well, it will be great if we took some lessons from four years of Trump.

There was a time when I regularly visited conservative media news sites. In fact, I still do although the frequency has considerably decreased these days. I consume conservative media not only because I like listening to and reading all viewpoints and challenging my own opinions, but also because I genuinely think that the conservative thinkers have got a lot of things right—especially about the human nature and the nature of society—that has been proven to be true time and again in history.
Contrary to common misconception, conservative thinkers are not a monolithic block of people who think alike in all situations. The nuances that go into forming their ideologies is as intricate and thoughtful as any; and is based on a deep realism about history, culture, society, and human psychology. Take the case of Edmund Burke, the patron saint and founder of modern-day conservatism from the eighteenth century, for example. While Burke adamantly stood against any kind of revolution à la the French Revolution from taking place in England, he also stood against the English monarchy when it came to the treatment of the colonized people. He supported the sovereignty of the colonized based on the recognition of their rights and led the impeachment trial against Warren Hastings, the erstwhile Governor-General of Bengal, who was accused of corruption and maltreatment of the Indian people. He was a Whig who regularly voiced his opposition against King George III’s government and advocated against England’s policies in support of the revolutionaries in America for which the Americans feel indebted to this day.
In Reflections on the Revolution in France published in 1790, a year after the fall of Bastille, Burke urged caution against any radical changes and declared that the “society is a partnership of the dead, the living and the unborn”—a quote that is invoked ad nauseam by many conservative thinkers, often without full realization of its meaning. Burke doubted the efficacy of the changes brought by “social engineering” and argued in favor of change that was gradual and organic. The spiral of violence that lasted for generations in post-revolutionary France in fact vindicated Burke, who slowly but surely, was put on a pedestal by thinkers of conservative persuasion who later followed in his footsteps. Burke wasn’t only suspicious of radical changes, but also questioned whether reason and human rationality alone could solve human afflictions. Given Burke’s skepticism about the efficacy of social engineering via radical change and his pessimism about human nature, I have often wondered what Burke would think of the changes in Nepal.
In his book The Conservative Mind, the American political thinker Russell Kirk, writes: “Burke has no expectation that men can be kept from social change; neither is rigidity of form desirable. Change is inevitable and is designed providentially for the larger conservation of society; properly guided, change is a process of renewal.” In other words, Burke supports social change as long as it is properly guided and done in a piecemeal manner because change leads to renewal of our societies and an even greater bonding in our communities. “A state without the means of some change,” Burke contends, “is without the means of its conservation.” Further, with respect to equality, Burke writes:
Whatever each man can separately do, without trespassing upon others, he has a right to do for himself; and he has a right to a fair portion of all which society, with all its combinations of skill and force, can do in his favor. In this partnership all men have equal rights; but not to equal things.
Burke was indeed not an egalitarian and did believe in social hierarchies; however, he did also strongly believe that equal justice is a natural right while equal dividend is not. He anticipated the follies and violence of communism—which tries to level societies in the name of distributing equal dividend—way ahead than most and was again proved correct by what transpired in the USSR and China in the early- and mid-twentieth century. Burke also supported the civil rights of Catholics, a religious minority, in England which cost him his parliamentary seat and stood staunchly against the practice of slavery. In replying to an anti-Catholic demagogue in the British parliament, Burke once proclaimed, “The only religion I profess is that of universal humanity and benevolence.”
Now, if we compare the general idea of Burke’s notion of equality and social change against the backdrop of the Nepali context, it compels us to take stock of several facts still prevalent in our society. First thing that comes to mind is the notion of human dignity: whereas conservatism, in its modern iteration, has, if only reluctantly, come to accept the individual as a sovereign and human dignity as inherent in all men and women; Nepali conservatism, on the other hand, has hardly budged from its centuries-old mindset. A large section of the population is still treated as less than human simply because they were born in the wrong caste, or the wrong geographical region, or in the wrong religion. In so far as the conservatives alienate and find excuses to exclude these groups of people from a shared transcendental national identity, conservatism, as a social and political power, Burke would argue, is bound to atrophy by the day.
Second fact that would most likely rile Burke would be the way religion is practiced in our country. Whether we admit it or not, a lot of the social ills stem from the way our religion is conceived. Religion, no doubt, provides an anchor to our lives and guides us through both psychological and materialistic deficiencies; it inspires us to appreciate the beauty and the sublime. Hence, there is no point in fighting back religion for it will remain so long as the mankind survives, and it is a glue that holds our culture together. However, there is an urgent need to reimagine our religion so that it incorporates and responds to modern sensibilities. Mere lip-service will not suffice, people need to seriously change the way they think to regain the trust of the minorities—for starters, questioning your own privileges that have no ties to science and reason would be an essential first step. Accepting secularism as one of our national creeds would be another: a nation where more than eighty percent of the population follow Hinduism doesn’t need to cry wolf when secularism might in fact enlarge the tent and attract more followers.
Third, Burke would say that we need to reimagine our nationality identity such that Nepalis from every geographical region feel included and heard in the decision-making mechanism of the country. If monarchy and religion were something that propped up our national identity in the past, we now need to foster a new identity, perhaps something along the lines of what Francis Fukuyama calls the “creedal identity,” based on political principles such as constitutionalism, the rule of law, and democratic accountability. Any more strain on the national identity can prove fatal for our country, so the more inclusive we become, the stronger our national identity becomes. As a country we need to work toward bringing the disillusioned into the fold and that should be done by enlarging our hearts and minds, not by turning inward and cocooning ourselves.
Among other things Burke would also probably take issue with runaway consumerism, the destruction of the environment, and a civil society which is destructively divided along party lines. Our civil society is in urgent need of a renewal where interpersonal relations are not just built on a political basis but also in various other ways such as community service, sports, reading clubs etc. We need to find ways other than party politics to establish bonds among fellow citizens and create trust among each other.
Conservatives can play a constructive role in the remaking of a modern Nepal that is open, free, democratic, tolerant, and just. Conservatives can no longer support an edifice of governance that perpetuates structural discrimination, and still believe to be relevant in modern day politics. Thankfully, the chasms we see in our country are not irreconcilable, not at least anywhere near what we see in the US or even in India, where communal violence is often stoked for political gains. Conservatism is a necessary force; it’s just that the conservatives need to find the right ideas to conserve.

A couple of days ago a friend of mine tagged me on a Facebook post shared by the radio-journalist-turned-politician Rabindra Mishra. “The guy has finally come out of the closet,” he wrote, adding his bit on the link before sharing it on his own Facebook wall. Bibeksheel Sajha Party President Mishra—a neophyte in the Nepali political scene who has continuously touted the merits of “alternative politics”—had apparently put out a manifesto where he argued for the abolition of federalism and called for a plebiscite to decide the future of secularism in Nepal. It was ironical that a politician who has essentially built up his political career riding the backs of progressive youths in the country had recycled and repackaged his deeply held personal prejudices and was serving as an “alternative” the same old ideas of militant majoritarianism that brought us here in the first place. It was ironical but not very surprising.
Mishra until now had parried away questions relating to his political ideology by appealing to a sort of “transcendental ideology” where ideologies, in the old sense, would be non-existent and instead there would be an ad hoc application of all kinds of political principles. He has finally ended up dashing the hopes of thousands of forward-looking youths who strive for a just and equitable tomorrow. By parasitically tapping into the deep wells of energy, positivity, optimism, and vigor of the youths from his party, Mishra has not only betrayed their agendas but also revealed his opportunistic and reactionary side—perhaps the only side—that is bent on misleading the movement of the youths in the country. His proposal wasn’t surprising also because a lot of us had already guessed that by hewing to no ideology at all, Mishra was in fact aiming to curry favor from the ancien regime which has been eagerly waiting for its own resurrectionist. No sooner had he revealed his manifesto, the chattering class of Kathmandu, a place that is as callous as it is disdainful and apathetic to the rest of the country, expressed a collective sigh of relief for here was a man who has finally spoken their mind.
In a gleeful taunt aimed at people who were dismayed by Mishra’s newfound regressive ideology and, perhaps, at Mishra himself, the TV talk show host Vijay Kumar Panday, tweeted that Mishra wasn’t saying anything new at all; rather it was the people whose “legs were made of straw”—translation: those who support secularism and federalism  were overly reacting to a commonly expressed view. Another TV show host Bhushan Dahal, known for his mawkish nostalgia toward the ousted monarchy, put out an encouraging tweet backing Mishra and urging him, in his own roundabout style, to stick to his agenda at all costs and prove his mettle.
What these tweeting heads do not consider is that just because there is a majority which potentially supports their agendas of dissolution of federalism and establishment of a Hindu kingdom doesn’t mean that the nation needs to blindly follow their unrestrained passions. They forget that Nepal, as a country, is a representative democracy with an established Constitution, which is in fact inherently suspicious of and hostile toward any form of majoritarianism. And, yes, the Constitution is there precisely because it needs to protect the “legs of straw” of the minorities who have historically been bereft of their voices. That is what federalism and secularism do: they allow for people from all faiths (or no faith at all), class, caste, and geographical regions to feel included in the decision-making process of this democratic country. To be sure, Nepali federalism is not without its faults, not least because of leaders who operate with the feudal mindset. However, those questioning the legitimacy and efficacy of federalism and secularism need to understand that federalism in Nepal was not instituted to address the needs of the Kathmandu dwellers who were already well off. There is not going to be any drastic change in the lives of people like Rabindra Mishra. Rather, it was instituted to be responsive to and redress the grievances of the historically marginalized who have finally, if only in fits and starts, found their voices.
Beside his deep-seated suspicion toward federalism and secularism, Mishra’s proposal is also representative of something more insidious that passes as intellectuality in the Nepali intellectual sphere: it showcases extreme egocentrism and ethnocentrism probably rooted in the Brahminical knows-it-all psyche which is reluctant to question its own privileges and tone down its elitism. Whether they see the connection or not, Mishra and his ilk are essentially arguing in support of a system that has, for centuries, denied the minorities of their individual dignity and humanity. Both federalism and secularism seek to redress the deficiencies in our society, and they depend on the honesty and integrity of the leaders who pledge to abide by its principles. If there is anything that needs to change, it is the mindset of our leaders—not the Constitution. The Constitution is working just fine as recently demonstrated by the landmark decision from the Supreme Court. Of course, it needs to be more and more inclusive, but there is no need to jump off the cliff with Mishra.

Imagine a job interview where the interviewer asks the candidate to mention five good traits about themselves. But instead of a candidate with a masters' degree and an excellent resume you have a student from maybe the fifth grade or the second grade on the chair. What answer do you expect?
Well, I tried finding that by conducting a small survey among students from the second to the seventh grades in March 2021. I asked them to write five good and five bad things about themselves on a piece of paper. There were six classes, and each class had around 22 students on average. I collected their papers and noted the most repeated traits. In this piece of writing, I have tried to present an overview on the students’ beliefs and how they tend to concur with some pre-existing theories of moral development.
Students in grade six and seven mentioned that they are good at friendships. They respect the elders and they always do their homework on time. They follow traffic rules and cross the road through zebra crossings. As bad traits, they mentioned that they get irritated and angry easily. They use their mobile phones or watch television a lot and don’t sleep on time. Some of them even said that they cheat during exams.
In grade four and five, students mentioned they do their homework every day and they are polite. They help their mother in household chores, respect elders and they have really good handwriting. They also cleaned their room themselves. Sharing their bad traits they wrote that they have little control over anger and patience. They sometimes get angry at friends and family and say things that they don’t mean. They are also aware of the fact that they hurt others’ feelings knowingly or unknowingly. Some peculiar responses however, were the ones mentioning that they don't like religions other than their own, some being addicted to TikTok and some saying that they don't like pink color.
The notes from grades three and two were quite interesting. It is the phase when children start developing their preliminary sense of good and bad. For good traits, they also mentioned helping their mother in house chores, throwing the waste in the dustbin and waking up early. They thought it was good that they shared food and other things like pencils and erasers with their friends. Not doing homework on time, watching a lot of television or having bad handwriting was a bad trait for them. They also kept  losing their items (pencils, erasers, etc) and they didn’t speak in English during the classes. Some said that they make noise in the class and get angry very easily. The responses from this group which really got my attention were ‘I am fatting’ (getting fat) and ‘I am not good at social’ (socializing).
While looking at the wide variety of responses from the children about the good and bad traits, we should not forget that they aren’t the ones who dictated those traits for themselves. The notion of good and bad traits is not inherited but it rather comes from an individual’s sense of morality. According to Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget’s theory of moral development, children are in the heteronomous phase which can be identified by the idea that rules come from authority figures in one’s life, such as parents, teachers, and those rules are permanent no matter what. Children , in large part, are also influenced by the prize and punishment norm where good behavior is rewarded and bad behavior is punished. The severity of punishment is also directly proportional to the bad behavior. Thus, children regard consequences more important than the action that will cause it. For example: a student with the fear of failing exams might end up cheating in exams to pass despite knowing that cheating is a bad thing to do.
This phase is seen in children from the age of five. As they grow into  adults they enter the autonomous phase where the action itself is seen as more important than its consequences. They begin to understand that different people have different morals and that morality is not necessarily universal.
American psychologist Lawrence Kohlberg expanded this theory on a stage model similar to Piaget’s, and proposed three levels with six stages of moral development. Individuals create their realm of morality from the universal experiences of punishment and rewards, approval and disapproval from the society, community respect and disrespect as well as self-condemnation. He named the three levels: pre-conventional, conventional, and post-conventional, each accommodating two stages. For the survey I conducted, Kohlberg’s first and second levels of moral development would be in focus.
The first or pre-conventional level has two stages: Stage 1—ethics of obedience and punishment in which an individual’s sense of morality is motivated by the desire to avoid punishment and Stage 2—ethics of self-interest where an individual’s morality is based on whether an activity serves them back or not. These stages can be seen in motion with the responses from students where they believed that doing homework on time and sharing food as well as other items with their friends was a good thing to do.
The second or conventional level also has two stages: Stage 3—ethics of social norms and Stage 4—ethics of law and order. In stage 3 individuals shape their actions and mindset according to the approval or disapproval they are getting from the social construct around them. The responses from children where they believe that respecting elders and helping their mother in household chores is a good trait perhaps comes from the approval that arrives after those actions. More or less it is the desire to be tagged as a ‘good child’. Stage 4 shapes the idea of morality in an individuality based on their culpability and presence of a central law. They have to be more responsible regarding their action or inaction. One person violating a law might initiate a chain reaction which results in everyone doing the same thus a duty to uphold laws and rules comes as an obligation. Stage 4 can be seen being reflected on the students’ notion of following traffic rules (present in older students from 6-7th grades) and speaking English in school (present in younger students below the 6th grade)  as good traits.
I took this survey to understand each class better; their problems and their strengths and how I can help them as a teacher and mentor. After getting these answers from them, I feel like I have got a chance to know them better. It was surprising to discover that the notion of good and bad traits that my friends and I had a decade ago while we were in school is more or less similar to that these present-day children have. We had very little control over anger or patience. We too wanted to be socially accepted as ‘good boy’ or ‘good girl’. I believe all of us undergo a lot of ‘learning’ as a child but as we grow up into adults both ‘learning’ and ‘unlearning’ is equally necessary.
On a side note, many students mentioned watching television a lot in the survey. Back when I was in school a decade ago, smart phones were not so mainstream in my town. But we watched television a lot. As the internet and smartphones proliferated I had grown this notion that maybe young people don’t watch television as much (or not at all). However, I was wrong, television is here to stay. Every generation loves to assume and comment regarding the upcoming generations without realizing some of those assumptions and comments might be far from truth. It would have never occurred to me that ‘fatting’ or body appearance would find space in a second grade student’s morality. This whole ordeal has ultimately taught me the importance of honest conversations with children which might be difficult as parents and schools grow busier.

Wastewater is a complex mixture containing contaminated water from sewers, storm runoff from streets, lawns, farms, and other land areas, generated at both household and industrial scale. As such, there is a possibility of the presence of debris from streets, vehicle spillovers, pesticides, fertilizers, and human as well as animal waste. The mixture thus becomes a potential carrier of various types of microbes, harmful chemicals, heavy metals, and other hazards. The practice of disposal of treated wastewater into the river or other water bodies is quite common in developing countries. Such practices include direct disposal of partially treated or untreated wastewater in the rivers and subsequently to groundwater sources. The wastewater discharged into the river systems in developing countries exceed the threshold limit of 2-5 cubic meter per day set by the Environmental Protection Agency, a US-based regulatory body that sets a guideline for environmental assessment, research and education. Given the increased demand for water and shortage of its supply, people from developing countries rely on underground water sources. The utilization of these contaminated groundwaters by humans may pose a significant health risk to human, resulting in the occasional outbreaks of water-borne diseases.
History and significances of wastewater surveillance
Wastewater treatment plant is the ultimate destination of all the harmful substances produced on the surface of the earth. Surveillance of the wastewater is fundamental in determining the harmful content that might get transported through the surface water or remains stacked in the underground aquifers. Regular monitoring of wastewater may provide an alternative medium for early warning of a potential outbreak in future, as such, the field of wastewater based epidemiology (WBE) is of growing interest among scientists globally.
WBE usually includes analysis of water to monitor public health indicators and to measure the load of pathogens in a community including SARS-CoV-2. The history of WBE dates back to the mid-1800s (1849-1854) during the cholera epidemic in Great Britain. In the early days of the epidemic, cholera was assumed to be an air-borne disease and not waterborne. John Snow, a British physician currently known as the father of modern epidemiology, studied death rates in two different districts that supplied water from a particular section of Thames river in London and proposed that cholera was a water-borne disease.
The term WBE was used for monitoring drug consumption for the first time in 2001. Later, in 2005, this approach was applied by a group of researchers in Italy to estimate the usage of cocaine. However, before the aforementioned two instances, the application of wastewater surveillance system in disease surveillance had already been adopted by the researchers in Israel to monitor polio outbreaks in 1988. The data generated by this environmental surveillance can be utilized by epidemiologist to describe the burden of disease in the population and its trend by applying modelling approaches, which allows decision-makers to respond rapidly toward the management of outbreaks. There has been sufficient evidence of the performance of wastewater surveillance for enteric viruses (major causes of gastroenteritis and reproduction in a human host). The approach has successfully monitored the spatial and temporal extent of enteric virus circulation in different countries
Future possibilities on wastewater surveillance                                                
The SARS-CoV-2 has been found to be discharged through human feces. Researchers all over the world have been developing a standard protocol for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material from wastewater using WBE, for designing early warning systems to alert the presence of the pathogen in a given community. The WBE technique is cost-effective and comparatively less time-consuming. Although least developed countries do not have a centralized system for sewage collection and treatment, investigating samples collected from the open sewer pipe, drainage, decentralized sewage system from the community can be helpful in identifying infection hotspots and tracking the waves of disease transmission.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, there is chance of discharge of viruses from both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. The asymptomatic carriers can be a possible source of shedding the viruses into the environment, thereby enhancing the potential transmission of diseases within the community. Therefore, identifying the asymptomatic carriers is necessary to track the source of infection and break the chain of disease transmission. Identifying asymptomatic carriers is, however, a challenging task that requires well-trained personnel, and is expensive as well as tedious. Therefore, monitoring of wastewater is an important alternative prospect for early warning systems to determine the presence of diseases in a given community, and can help prevent spread of diseases. In addition, the wastewater monitoring approach can be integrated with several other technologies to discover undetermined issues related to the population. This environmental approach could be of high value to scientists and policymakers globally for the management of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially for lower middle income countries with poor resources and financial capacity.

The global population of Asiatic elephant has been estimated at around 48,323–51,680 in the wild (Menon and Tiwari 2019). The number of elephants in the world has been quickly declining over the past several decades. Wild Asian elephants (Elephans maximus) is classified as endangered species in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list and  Appendix I species in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).
The Bardia National Park (BNP) is one of the largest and diverse protected areas (IUCN Category II) in tarai covering an area of 968 square kilometers. This national park has a long success story in conservation. Bardia is home to nearly 80 elephants, about one-third of the total population in the country. Proper management of grassland, a large number of water bodies, and floodplains make this national park a suitable habitat for elephants. The role of elephants in the forest ecosystem is very vital and they are symbolized as ‘ecosystem engineers' and commonly referred to as a 'keystone' species. Similarly, elephants are an integral part of our culture and heritage. In the Hindu religion, the elephant is a sacred animal and is worshipped as the living incarnation of Lord Ganesh.
Drivers of human-elephant conflict
The Asiatic elephant is an herbivore which can eat about 150 kilograms of plant materials in its active eating duration of 16 hours a day. These giant animals prefer to live in a large evergreen forest for their survival and their long-ranging habits inevitably bring them in direct contact with humans leading to conflict. Dr Dinesh Neupane’s research article on “Status, patterns, and potential mitigation of human-elephant conflict in Nepal and elephant habitat use in Bardia National Park, Nepal” showed that only 20% of the total area in BNP was highly favorable for elephants which may not be sufficient to hold the existing numbers.
Elephants are reported as the leading cause of crop raiding and degradation, and communities also often suffer property damage, human injuries, and deaths. Traditional farming practices such as growing rice and maize, planting banana trees in yards, and fermenting alcohol inside the home attract this megafauna in the human landscape. The low-level subsistence farmers living near protected areas depend on the forest resources increasing risks of conflict. Poverty also reduces a household’s coping ability and adaptive capacity to respond to elephant damages. Population growth, habitat fragmentation, regular highway activities are few other drivers of human-elephant conflict in Bardia.
Invasive plant species such as Chromolaena odorata and Lantana camara inside protected areas modify plant community structure which reduces plant species richness and diversity affecting food resources for elephants.
Status in Bardia
One Nareswor Sapkota, 78, from Basgadhi municipality 8 Baishapur was trampled to death on June 16. Altogether 41 human fatalities and 115 human injuries were reported in Bardia since 2000. Three persons have lost their lives since mid-April which shows the severity of the problem. Retaliatory killing of elephants is not seen but a few were injured during conflict. This issue is gaining more and more attention in conservation. The  nature of each conflict is completely different from another, which is one of the great challenges in managing the conflict. Recently a herd of wild elephants entered Bardia through Khata Corridor from Katarniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary in India which is becoming a matter of concern.
Mitigation practices 
The concrete cement walls and electric wires installed in the fringe of the forest are the most effective applied mitigation measures to mitigate human-elephant conflict in Bardia, according to the research article titled “Human-Elephant Conflict and Mitigation Measures in Buffer Zone of Bardia National Park, Nepal” by Rabin Paudel and team. Application of repellant methods such as firecrackers, drums, and acoustic deterrents are practiced in some areas to ward the tuskers away. Cottage like structure (machan) is constructed to look out for elephants entering agriculture lands.
US-funded Hariyo Ban Program is providing support to local people in large-scale commercial citrus lemon farming. There is a provision of financial compensation to those who are affected by human-elephant conflict. However, people are not satisfied with these packages due to insufficient compensation, logistical challenges, lack of transparency, reduced local understanding of program scope and limitations, and fraudulent claims.
The World Wildlife Fund (WWF), the National Trust for Nature Conservation (NTNC), and a few cooperatives are becoming successful in helping women, youths, and forest-dependent marginalized families to start their own small-scale agriculture and eco-tourism based business thereby reducing pressure on forest and biodiversity. Capacity building and awareness programs are necessary to change the perception of people toward elephants.
Identification of problematic elephants is necessary and their regular monitoring using radio collar is crucial. The BNP in support of the IUCN, the Global Nature Fund, and Ujyalo Nepal has started a program “Hatti Khabar” in Tiger FM to disseminate information to the public regarding elephant activities.
Long-term habitat enriching methods such as fodder plantations, soil management, and creating water resources like water holes inside the forest are also being implemented. Management of forest fire, grassland, and invasive plant species is necessary to restrict these megafaunas inside the forest. Forest corridors have also proved to be a critical connection for migratory elephants.
Way forward
More research is needed to understand the spatial and temporal distribution of human-elephant conflict in Bardia. Conflict mitigation cannot be solved by the BNP alone. It requires multidisciplinary collaboration between different levels of government, INGOs, NGOs, indigenous tharu community, women groups, biologists, media, and locals in formulating conflict mitigating plans which also helps to strengthen the human-elephant co-existence. No single solution is effective and different management approaches need to be integrated to address the problem proactively.

There is a reason why they say, ‘bureaucracy is a giant mechanism run by pygmies’. Sounds pretty harsh, but sad reality of the time we live in. We have always been shown a dream, a dream of better future on all fronts. The dreams, alas, have now turned into ashes, literally ‘ashes’. Yes, I am talking about the crumbling health system which has claimed the lives of many of our near and dear ones.
Emotions are running high, high not on substance but on something unusual, the budget for fiscal year 2078/79. This budget has been seen as the most progressive package in 70 years of its history when it comes to health sector, allocating 7.45% for the sector. But the bigger question remains, will government walk the talk, or is it just another gimmick for vote-bank politics?
Talking about some of the glitches of this allocation, allow me to put before you some of the thought-provoking questions. Of 7.45%, what percentage has been allocated for the upliftment of long-term fundamentals of health care delivery system? Only miniscule! Most of it seems to address only COVID-19 crisis which is no less than a quick fix. And quick fixes will not contribute to the fundamentals. Rs 4 billion has been allocated for high dependency units (HDU), intensive care units (ICU), ventilators etc. What about human resources? Or, have they been talking about artificial-intelligence driven HDU and ICU? Come on! Have some foresight. The hospital I work in has one ventilator with cobwebs all around. Also, a concept of satellite clinic has been brought up. Well, this is nothing but a smart move to cover up government doctor’s inadequacy statistics by shunting human resources of higher institutions to the periphery. This is certainly not going to help in the long run.
Governments come and go. So much so that we've seen over 20 governments in the past 30 years. What remains is bureaucracy, the backbone of all government bodies. While the leaders have received their fair share of criticism, pinning blame solely on them doesn’t suffice to explain the situation we’ve been witnessing today. Bureaucrats are as responsible for this nightmare as the politicians, if not more. The government can only implement policies if the bureaucrats deliver to the best of their ability. But everything in the end boils down to inefficiency and corruption because there seems to be no ethical limit to their pursuit of money. Today most of the hospitals are spending a fortune in those sector which guarantees them handsome amount of commission. From construction to procurement of equipment, corruption is rampant everywhere. I can say this from my personal experience working as a medical officer at the Sunsari District Hospital in Inaruwa. The pharmacy doesn't have basic medicines. But the hospital premise gets new building year after year for no reason. After completion, they are left unused for years because it was never necessary and what is necessary is nowhere near. What does this tell us? Bureaucracy is no less than a syndicate which has reduced all government hospitals to mere non-functioning garbage. Many potential private hospitals are awaiting validations from the government for the expansion of its service. But the complexity of whole process is so grave that one has to offer a huge amount of money to grease the officials' palm to get go-ahead. Why only money can expedite the whole process and not the will power of bureaucrats? Think about it!
The combined complacency of politicians and bureaucrats has not only undermined the quality of health service but also put the health professionals at the risk of being targeted by patient’s kins like the incident of Bheri Hospital, Binod Mishra's case and many more. Proper maintenance of patient-doctors/nurses ratio, medical equipment like dialysis machine etc, are not the responsibilities of health professionals to watch over. The healthcare system is now under immense stress. So are health workers. Let us provide health services with adequate sense of security deep inside. Well, that's not too much to ask for.
Amidst all doom and gloom, the authorities concerned have yet another chance to prove themselves in this moment of crisis. All it takes is commitment and a radical revolutionary approach because we can’t solve the problem by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them, as Einstein said. Or else, bureaucracy will always remain a giant mechanism run by pygmies.

As I write this, my heart is heavy with grief and smoldering with anger. Just today there was news of nurses getting mobbed and attacked by the relatives of a patient. It is deeply saddening to see incidents like these come up almost every week and makes one really wonder how many of such incidents actually occur weekly. These incidents make big noise and are all over the media for some days only to abate rather quickly without making actual changes to the laws or policies. Different groups of people react differently, some strongly condemn it with hashtags of ‘jailwithoutbail’, the others remark that we should at least not have to hear such news amidst the pandemic and then there are people who find a way to blame the healthcare workers by bringing it down to  negligence or lack of communication. There are definitely many factors that fuel the epidemic of violence against healthcare workers, ranging from sheer hooliganism to lack of proper communication. These incidents could easily contribute to burnout which ultimately affects the quality of care that patients receive.
Healthcare workers burnout is a complex problem that is often not discussed in our society. It is a work related syndrome characterized by extreme emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and a loss of sense of personal accomplishments. In simple words what it means is that they are in a state where they feel they are not in control of their lives, see patients as objects and deem themselves unable to help patients successfully. The factors leading to this state are many. The medical field is a highly demanding one where aspirants learn to prioritize their work before anything else early on. The robust training, followed by long work hours, paperwork and to top all that the struggle to maintain a balanced personal and professional life definitely serves as an alloy leading to burnout. Just the other day I saw a tweet by a doctor who shared a rather woebegone incident of the day his father-in-law committed suicide. He was in the clinic when he received a call from his wife informing him of the sad news and he responded by telling her how he was very busy at the moment and would get back to her later. Needless to say, this triggered a much needed discussion on the sheer impact work and responsibilities have on a physician’s life.
A study conducted by a team of Nepali doctors and students, which was published in BMC Psychiatry in 2020 stated that 48.8% out of 651 residents and medical students involved in the study were deduced to be burnt out. The increasing cases of abuse against healthcare workers leave them fearing for their safety; further fueling the likelihood of burnout. While this is definitely bad news for anyone working in the medical field or aspiring to do so, it also comes with implications to the public. In recent years there have been a number of studies that correlate physician burnout and its negative impact on the quality of patient care. Doctors are considered to be god and even expected to behave accordingly. There is no room for any mistake for them. This is why discussing this issue in the medical field is absolutely necessary. People need to see doctors for who they are, a human being trained to provide medical services. They too come with their own flaws.
Violence at the healthcare setting is not a problem of Nepal alone. The WHO states that 8-38 % of healthcare workers are subjected to work related physical violence at some point in their career. Many more are abused through verbal aggressions. But in Nepal, a lot of these incidents, especially verbal abuse are not seen as a problem and are never reported. We all know the resolution to this epidemic. We need stricter laws, better security and an overall fall in corruption to ensure implementation of laws. But the grim picture is that these solutions will never really be implemented efficiently or at least not unless doctors and nurses start losing their lives because of it. If not, for the well being of healthcare workers then at least for the sake of quality of health services for the public, I hope positive change in some form will be introduced. Until then it is probably in everyone’s best interest that medical students are taught some form of self defense and hospitals are made with hidden corners where we can go to hide when our lives are being threatened.

COVID-19 has overwhelmed the health system across the globe. Sixty-five Nepali resident doctors in Delhi have been tirelessly treating COVID patients for over a year. The All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), the premier medical institute of India, has been reluctant to recognize even our basic human rights. We have dependent families back home in Nepal but are sharing the workload of patient care amidst the  raging COVID-19 crisis in India without an honorarium. We are among the frontline warriors in the fight against COVID, whether at the AIIMS COVID Emergency Area, COVID screening area or at the Intensive Care Unit. The immense delay and apathy toward providing financial security to those of us who are working away from our home country, has increased psychological stress over and above the financial crisis. Nearly all of us have been infected with the deadly disease, with a few needing oxygen support, and have had a hard time to recover. We are in India during a crisis, helping India recover, but are not being taken care of, neither by the Indian Health Ministry nor our own institute.
We have come to India for a post-graduate or doctoral level three-year residency training in MD/MCH/MDS/DM in many different specialities and super-specialities at AIIMS. But, because of the raging pandemic, we are bound to care for COVID patients only. This has significantly cut down our training duration. If we were to do the same training in the US or UK or any other premier institute anywhere in the globe, we would have been paid a basic living expense. There are three Institutes of National Importance (INIs) in India where foreign nationals come to complete residency after clearing the INI CET exam (Institute of National Importance Combined Entrance Test). Other two institutes--the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) in Chandigarh and the Jawaharlal Institute of Post Graduate Medical Education and Research (JIPMER) in Puducherry--pay foreign nationals for the work they do but AIIMS does not.
We are not sponsored by the Government of Nepal which has only issued a no objection certificate to be admitted for training as foreign nationals in India. We write the same entrance exams, pass a common national test same as our Indian counterparts to get enrolled in the same course, purely and entirely based on merit, among hugely competitive seats dedicated to any foreign national across the world. We perform the same type of duty for the same duration as our Indian counterparts. Amid the raging second wave of COVID-19 pandemic, we are in extreme financial and psychological crisis with decreasing physical health but are still tirelessly treating COVID-19 patients round the clock, but are unfortunately being ignored for more than a year.
The Delhi High Court in 2013, had directed AIIMS to start paying its foreign doctors on par with Indian doctors. The court had pointed that when it came to a fundamental right available to even non-citizens, to be paid for the work they do, the terms of the prospectus of AIIMS on non-payment to foreign nationals could not be binding. That judgement was later stayed till an appeal filed by AIIMS is adjudicated. The prime minister's office and the Ministry of External Affairs in 2018 then directed the institute to make necessary amendments and release the due salary of the foreign doctors. However, the AIIMS administration is adamant that they will not pay the foreign nationals working as resident doctors. It is noteworthy that even undergraduate and interns are allowed honorarium for COVID duties whereas AIIMS administration is surprisingly unable to draw a distinction between the duties and responsibilities of a professionally trained doctor undergoing post-graduate training from that of interns. The Health Ministry also asked for the financial implications to which AIIMS administration had responded that it would hardly be IRs 60-70 million per annum (a small fraction of AIIMS annual operating budget). We desire for nothing extravagant but are merely asking that we be paid at least daily living expenses for the work we do, which is a basic human right.
The situation has worsened with the pandemic, and we have been reduced to a point of borrowing money in India during a raging crisis when banks are not operating at full capacity due to prohibitory orders in Nepal. Even Indian PM Narendra Modi’s announcement of insurance policy worth IRs 5 million for the frontline health workers who are treating coronavirus patients does not cover us, as we are foreigners.
COVID-19 has led to unprecedented challenges including difficult duty rosters, travel restrictions, quarantine requirements, isolation stressors and concerns about the spread of the deadly virus back home in Nepal. We have been denied even basic payment against the instructions of Indian PM Modi and the Indian Health Ministry. We, therefore, urge the Nepal government and the Nepali Embassy in India to coordinate with the Indian government to help us get paid.

 “Tomorrow I am leaving for the far west for a field work on menstruation and today I get my period.  What a weird coincidence?”
I am immediately reminded of my privilege of not having to go to an abandoned hut straight away.
The self-talk was running on my mind just before I went on to my second field work of 2020, the COVID year. My previous field work was in Sarlahi and Janakpur as part of food relief distribution.
It’s been a few years that I have been working for social concerns and I love visiting different communities and meeting the people there but even now field visits give me excitement and anxiety at the same time. Field visits have been an eye opener for me. On many occasions I have been confronted with my own unconscious biases, putting me through many uncomfortable emotions that ultimately help me grow as a person. I always bury some biases and pre-assumptions that I carried about social issues, there on the field.
This field was really important to me as I was going to Accham. I believe I may not be the only person whose brain is wired to think about “Chhaupadi” and “Rara Lake” when we hear Far West.
We were informed that we were not staying in a hotel due to COVID-19 situation and we were about to stay at someone’s house there. The first thing that hit me was how were we going to manage our period and where were we going to dispose of our pads? And if we told the house owner that we were on our periods, were they going to put us in a “Chhau Goth”. What would that be like? All those stories and news of how the girls and women there stayed in a small Chhau hut during their menstruation and all those difficulties they faced and the incidents of abuse, violence and death that occurred inside Chhau hut started to play inside our heads.
“Are we really confident in pursuing this project after all?”
The “we” here is me and my friend Shreya. My trip partner.

Luckily, we got to stay in a hotel at Sanfebagar, Accham. The COVID threat was slowly dropping down and few hotels were taking guests. We got a nice room for us and no there were no ""Chhau Goth"" around Sanfebagar. It was a long day and we were exhausted. We had our morning tea at Kathmandu, lunch at Dhangadi and dinner at Accham, the same day. The road trip from Dhangadi to Accham was comfortable and a treat to the soul that continuously strives to be closer to nature. Throughout the trip I was in a state of serenity pointing toward everything  I found fascinating as if I were a baby. The scenic view of the haystacks all over the lands in Doti, the deep blue rivers, the green farms and everything present at that moment served me as a happy pill. After a period of lockdown inside the house due to COVID, just being there in the presence of nature and good people felt more than special.
The next morning, we went to Sakot, with some local activists. We were going there to conduct a program about “Dignified menstruation and the effect on mental health due to factors related to menstruation.” I was allocated to the resource section of mental health. The road was risky and we were an hour late at reaching the school. A group of young girls and women were waiting for us there already and they greeted us with a big but shy smile on their faces.
The program started and all I was expecting from them was to share about the menstrual taboos they followed and believed, and how they are helplessly giving in to all those menstrual stigmas because we went there all over from Kathmandu to break those taboos and stigmas, didn’t we? But, to my surprise most of the participants shared their stories of how they lied about their periods at home and stayed inside the house instead of Chhau hut to test whether the taboos are real. To test whether or not god punishes them for breaking the taboos.
Boooom, this was the first attack on my pre-assumptions about the Far West.
I was totally excited to listen to these stories of brave women, young and old, who spoke with their beautiful Acchami accent about how they were fighting the norms of their society and the anger and determination to root out the stigma that was prevalent in their community was radiating through their eyes and their voices. The credit was all to the local activists who worked to break that Chhau hut in their minds unlike the policy makers who are trying to decrease this problem by decreasing the number of physical Chhau goth. These activists have worked to empower these women to advocate what they learned and to fight to gain a position that they deserved at home and in society regardless of whether or not they are on their periods.

The thing that generated passion to work on this issue for me was not the fact that the society forces people to follow “Chhaupadi” in the name of culture but to know more about what makes all of us accept such degrading culture. When do we actually start believing that menstruation actually makes anyone impure? At what age? At which moment we decide to never experiment and explore the truth and accept all the ill treatment we receive based on the biological process?
We heard their stories about how they had to do all the outdoor chores while they were menstruating but were given dry bread for meals and restricted to eat most of the foods and are not allowed to drink milk.
Rupa Saud, 26, shared, “My in-laws think I am being over-smart by not staying in the Chhau hut. Back at my home in Surkhet I never had to follow Chhaupadi and nothing ever happened before. What’s the point of keeping our gods alive if we ourselves are going to die in a Chhau hut?”
Seema Kumari, 20 shared, ""The women here think we are gaining some personal benefits for advocating about this issue. Some of the women here don't wear any kind of pads. We offered to teach them pad-making skills using clothes available at home but they refused and said they will not use any such thing as they have never used anything to manage their periods before and just because you young people went to school doesn’t mean you know everything.”
Now, this was the second attack on my pre-assumption. My preconceived notions were challenged one after another and defeated bravely by the girls. I used to think people there were not being able to manage their periods properly and hygienically because they didn't have access to the materials. I used to think that if we would give them access to materials and skills, half the problem about menstrual hygiene would be solved. But, turns out it's just what I “think”.

As Socrates puts it, “I cannot teach anybody anything, I can only make them think.” After listening to these women and girls I felt that they have really started thinking and this thought has led them to take action to test those cultural norms. The reason I ended up there was also because I thought about these issues, I had few unanswered questions I was seeking answers for.
Lack of resources, information and skills are not the only problems. The mindset established against menstruation is a real problem. Who seeded such a strong fallacy of untouchability toward women on those days of the month? And how did such taboo spread so contagiously among all races, all geographies, and all levels of the people? It is one of many stirring unanswered questions that has been holding the women communities back in many parts of the world. But the positive part is, these questions have started to arise among some people and as long as there are people working to ignite such thoughts more and more, every single person can win and help others win the fight against such taboos on their own.
Now, my mind is no more wired to think about Chhaupadi when I hear Far West. All I now think is how many of us are carrying a Chhau goth inside our mind, wherever we go? How do we plan to take ourselves out of that small, narrow and dark Chhau goth?

There is a wide diversity of sexual orientations among human beings. Ever since I was a teenager, I was always confused about my orientation. As I never felt sexual attraction toward anyone, I used to consider myself an asexual. When I was 21, I happened to be very close to a gentleman, developed an emotional connection, and was surprisingly attracted to him. It was my one-sided attraction that was never reciprocated and thus never turned into a relationship. But this phase of my life helped me identify myself as a demisexual. 
A demisexual is someone who experiences sexual attraction only after having a strong emotional bond with an individual. After that incident, I could not feel sexually attracted to anyone in my life as I could not develop a strong emotional bond with anyone. Some people with similar orientations feel sexual attraction for only one person in their lives. They never get attracted to other individuals even after being separated from that first person. Other people of demisexual orientation can develop sexual attraction with other individuals if they can develop a strong emotional connection.
Growing up as a demisexual was a slightly different experience for me than that of my conventional heterosexual friends. I was never a part of the groups watching adult movies on weekends in the college hostel. I was never interested in going on romantic dates. I was never fascinated with adult trash talks with my friends. I was more interested in writing poetry, singing, and reading stories. Being a demisexual, I am misunderstood most of the time. The guys whose relationship or marriage proposals I have rejected often call me egoistic, picky, and someone who doesn’t respect their feelings toward me. The truth is that I cannot see them with lustful eyes as I don’t feel any sexual attraction toward them. Being in a relationship without deep friendship, mental connection, and strong emotional bond is no different than a nightmare. 
Some people have mistaken my orientation, assuming that I am a disciplined sexual. What they fail in understanding is the difference between a demisexual and a disciplined sexual person. 
A disciplined sexual can feel sexual attraction to other individuals without emotional bonds but choose not to participate in sexual activities without having an emotional bond first, and they also choose to be loyal with their choice. In the case of a demisexual, the person doesn’t have a sexual attraction in the first place if there is no deep emotional connection involved. They are never attracted to physical beauty, appearance, and aesthetics, and thus love at first sight doesn’t exist in their dictionary.
If anyone is interested in making a demisexual their life partner, then attractive gifts, dinner dates, flirting etc. are not going to help their cause. Such attempts might even be counter-productive as it might intensify the feeling of aversion. All they can do is start with friendship and let the demisexual individual explore them. Giving enough time in friendship until their emotional bond and friendship gets stronger is the best thing they can do.

Sparkles in her eyes, multi-hued. A shine of red, a glint of green, reflections of yellow brightness, light. She holds in her eyes that which fills women and girls with joy.Every morning after her family members eat and go their ways, she heads out with a basket on her head. The fragility of bangles, mirrors, and colors weighs down upon her head as she walks gracefully (in the past bare footed, now slipper-clad), her spine holding straight, her hips swaying gently. She is draped today in a dirt yellow sari, the sash turned turban-like to help her hold the basket in place. As she heads out to the bazaar, her girls have gone the other way--to study, get an education. One had a slight fever and needed medicine, the other had run out of copybooks for college work. They wondered what goodies they would make for snacks when they came back home after studying and made a fuss about what they saw available in the kitchen. They’ll have chicken tomorrow, it’s Saturday! She reminded them. The Churi Walli smiles as she settles down, placing her ware before her at the street side. Women and girls walking past look down at her basket--the colors, the sparkles take up their eyes and minds. Shovawati, the 55-year-old breadwinner, has kept together her family of 17 selling beauty enhancements. She offers happiness, a sense of self-worth, a daydream out of this world. Shovawati lives in Thulo Ganauria of Suddhodhan Municipality. She was born to parents for whom daughters were a burden. She was born at a time when the society accepted child marriage as a normal and grandparents, matchmakers, and parents made nuptial commitments early on, when girls and boys were still infants. Families at the time were under constant stress regarding the marriage of their daughters. The sooner the knot was tied, the safer their daughter’s future would be and it was not often that the family had a good idea of what their child was getting into physically or mentally. Such was the world Shovawati was born into. “I sell bangles and cosmetic products, things that make women and girls feel good about themselves. I come from a living immersed in traditional values that I sometimes unknowingly try to impose on my daughters. For example, I still think with horror about this marriage I’d arranged for my 17-year-old daughter Sasikala!”“I did not see, I did not see.”  But then she did see! A different world. She became associated with SAHAJ and its mothers’ group. Mentors, peers, counselors talked to her, she talked to them. “I had much to do and earning to feed so many people had drained my energy. I had not taken the time to think!” Women, mothers, sisters, daughters, daughters-in-law, granddaughters: their rights, their health, their education, their financial independence, their wellbeing, their happiness came up in conversations. During one of the get-togethers of the group, a lawyer came to spend time with them and talked to them about the impact of child marriage.  “I was shocked.” Shovawati saw herself and her daughter in a different light. She saw her daughter as a victim and herself as the person hurting her. At 17, her “piece of heart” was still a child, she realized. She saw herself about to put her daughter at high risk to both physical harm and neglect. Early pregnancy would have long-term health effects and she would probably never finish her education, become financially able. The mother and daughter talked, “I'd like to complete my education,” said Sasikala when she learned of the questions SAHAJ had put in her mother’s mind.  “I was so happy to hear her say that,” Shovawati remembers. Her eyes tear up as she thinks of how close her daughter came to a life that she would perhaps never control. “Now, I tell everyone to tell their daughters to study, get a job, learn something that makes them financially able.” Tonight Shovawati will count the money she has earned over the day, she will think how fortunate she wants her daughters to be, how she will take care of them and their future so they can take care of themselves forever.

Can you point out in a doll where respect lies? Is it stored in specific areas of the doll? Does this apply to all humans?
Few months ago, a 19-year old girl was raped by a teacher in Doti. At first, he tried to lure her to have sexual relation with him using various incentives but when she did not give in, the teacher started blackmailing her using pictures of a school picnic.
The teacher repeatedly raped the girl by blackmailing. She even got pregnant and had to get an abortion in Kathmandu. The accused was brought to the court in Doti yet he was bailed.
While the story is saddening on its own what is even more dangerous is that girls like her do not prioritize their safety first. They feel they have a deep sense of responsibility to protect their respect at all cost.
Rape victims don’t open up about their abuse for several years due to the fear of being shamed. In addition, blackmail with pictures and videos have been a cause of suicides and rapes and this is where we need to introspect. 
What if these girls were taught differently? What if girls were not constantly told that their self-worth is in their body? Perhaps, we could have saved them from being raped, reduced their suffering and even prevented them from taking their own lives. 
Kamala Bhasin, an Indian developmental feminist activist, poet, author and founder member of Sangat Organization in an Indian talk-show has said, “If I am raped, people say I lost my honor. How did I lose my honor? Who kept my honor in my vagina? It’s the rapist who loses respect, not the woman who is raped.” 
We should teach girls that their honor and respect don’t lie inside their bodies or on the body parts as she rightfully mentions. The society widely holds women accountable for their respect, their family’s respect and respect of their whole community. 
However, everyone should try to understand that girls and women are not a vacant pot to keep dignity of everyone including themselves nor do they need to carry a mountain of prestige everywhere. In an age where they are sexualized every day, they need to stop believing that their body is a temple of worship.
We need to make it abundantly clear that respect and honor is not tattooed in their skin, muscles and bones. So, if they happen to be sexually violated or blackmailed for their pictures and videos to be leaked on the social media, they will not feel ashamed and consider taking their life.
This way even if girls participate in showing some skin, the society cannot map their character like tanned marks on their skin after exposure to the sunlight.
Moreover, the victims would not be blamed for the violence against them pointing at their 'exposed' bodies. Only if they know in their hearts that their pride is intact and it cannot be taken away so easily, they would open up about how they were violated and talk about the perpetrators. They would possibly report crimes more often if they know that they matter more than their image in the public.
We can’t risk any more lives due to embedded societal convictions placed on a girl from a young age. We can’t let them grow up believing that their bodies can be a medium of shame as it easily translates to saying their own bodies can become their enemy. 
It’s high time that girls unlearn conventional beliefs and relearn necessary values of putting themselves first. They should internalize that they as an individual are inherently valuable and that their safety not their social position is paramount.
Looking at the trends of how girls and women are shamed for being raped, sexually harassed and assaulted, this mindset that their private parts are an epitome of respect needs to change.
Let’s teach everyone again on respect starting with every girl child.

Lesson 1
We often share jokes about “wives”. The joke could be about how she is ""bossy"" or how she works, her routine, looks, the time she takes to get ready, etc. We laugh and forget all about it.
However, take a look at what we are actually doing:

We are telling the younger boys on the group that it is okay to “shame” and “demean” women. You might ask how? We are telling them it is okay to call women names and complain about the several things mentioned above. They don’t comprehend these as jokes. We are shaping the young boy to grow up and make jokes about the female figures in his life (could be his mom, partner, aunt, etc.). Are you okay with your little boy doing this?
We are telling the younger girls that it is okay to be treated like this. We are normalizing this situation for her. How? When a girl reads a joke, she automatically associates it to her mom, aunt, any female relative, who she looks up to. And she is picking up that it is okay to be treated like that and being called names. Would you like your daughter to be treated like this by her in-laws? Or even her siblings and other members of the family?
We are teaching both boys and girls that women (youngsters quickly associate the joke with their moms or any relative) are inferior or cunningly evil.
Some of those who are aware and feel awful about such jokes remain silent. How is this harmful? You teach your child it is okay to not stand up for women (whether a girl or a boy). You are normalizing the perception that women are inferior.

Lesson 2
Another sign of misogyny is the words we use to describe the same situation for a male and female.

While a man is “decisive”, a woman is “bossy”.
A man can be “authoritative” and “charismatic”, but a woman is “shrill”.
When a man is smart and talkative, we say the exact same words, ""smart and talkative"" but for a woman ""kainchi jaisi zubaan.""
A man would be called a leader, but a woman is a ""ballbreaker"".
When a man pushes his point, he is ""persistent"" while a woman is ""nagging.""
Why do we describe a man who expresses his emotions as a “little girl”? How is that supposed to be an insult? “Don’t be a girl” is often used to describe men who express emotions.

Why do we use different terminology? How are the two different? Why should we have to use derogatory words for women and positive comments for men?
Please refrain from doing this, whether around your child or not. You are creating a mentally toxic environment for both genders and are degrading women.
Lesson 3
How would you feel if your child is body/color shaming in public? Not good, embarrassed. You will probably ask yourself; “how did my child learn that?”
You don’t realize that you are the reason.

You share jokes and memes about the appearance of people, and females especially. Such supposed jokes are titled ""Who will marry her?"" or something even more insulting.
When looking for a ""bahu"", you prioritize fair-skinned and slim girls.

Who gave you the right to make comments about anybody’s body? When you do this around your child, s/he thinks it is okay to make such snarky comments. You are also creating an unhealthy environment for a young girl who will have complexes about the way she looks. Do you think it is right? For you, it might be a joke. For someone else, it could be her/ his whole life. Instead of focusing on petty things such as her looks, look into her education, hobbies, career, etc.
Lesson 4
Now reflect upon the upbringing of your children or someone who you have known closely. There is a massive difference between how we bring up a boy and a girl. I will choose just two examples, but I am sure you will have many more to share.

Cooking- Why are girls told from the very beginning that she must know how to cook? When looking for a “bahu”, knowing how to cook is a prerequisite. However, have you ever encouraged your boy to learn how to cook? Probably not. I am not saying stop encouraging your girls to cook. What I am saying is, start encouraging your boys. Cooking is essential for survival. Stop gender stereotyping the role of a cook. A man should know how to cook and survive through.
Office- Why are young boys asked to start visiting the office at an early age, but girls have to ""prove"" themselves before stepping in? Why do you ask your little boy to accompany his dad while the girl is usually helping her mom with chores? Do you think because women are less competent? Or do you not want your daughter or any female to be independent? Are you scared she will be better? Or are you waiting to get her married off? Why are women looked as somebody’s liabilities all the time? She is never her own person. First, she is her father’s daughter and then her husband’s wife. Where is her own identity?

Conclusion
While your joke has no hard intentions, it is doing more damage than one can think of. Now, this
is a problem. The anecdote easily converts or influences the mindset of the society (or is rather a result of the mentality of the community). Rape, sexual harassment, domestic abuse, dowry deaths and other crimes against women are a result of this inferior thought process toward women.
The above issues are a classic example of misogyny. Misogyny in the 21st century is turning into messages and jokes. Women are easily and more often than not accused by the 'peacemakers' when she complains about abuse at home. She is expected to ""accept"" her life. We quickly question her character, level of patience, what she is doing to serve her husband, etc., even when the actual issue may be about the misdeeds on the part of the man/husband.
Instead of demeaning women, it would be better to share jokes, articles, posts which are more respectful toward women. This will help nurture the future generations and accept women for who they are. It will create a better, ethical and equitable attitude in life. Men should learn that women are people who deserve respect and dignity—their opinion, decisions, complaints and consent matter. This change will only materialize when we begin changing our lifestyle and upbringing.
I hope by now, you have pretty much understood what I am trying to explain. Reflect on your behavior and stop discrimination. A light joke and remark can shape a child's future, and the circle of patriarchy will be never-ending. Ask yourself how you want the generations to come to treat the female figures in his/her life. And women, start standing up for yourselves. You might be financially dependent on your husband, but do you want the same dependence for your daughter? Also, never be afraid to ask for being treated right. Your reliance on your husband doesn't allow him to demean and insult you. His entire household depends on you. Never forget that.

Whenever I read about rapes, there is this wrenching pain in my heart with twisting and twirling of my abdomen, tears all over my eyes and my body totally numb. I take every rape related news very personally not because I have had a similar experience in life but because I think if someone decides to rape me I'll be raped. I am scared that I might be just another story someday. While sharing these infuriating thoughts with one of my closest friends he scoffed and asked me ""You need to stop viewing world with the lens of feminism. You are not a victim, your ranting isn't changing anything. Tell me what you can do?""
If I have to rant, I might rant on how unfair it is for us to feel threatened just to get out of our house not only at night but also in broad daylight. I would rant about how my choice of clothes determines my character. Meanwhile, I see men in shorts and sleeveless T-shirts and yet don't get aroused or tempted by their skin. That's probably because men do not have shiny and hairless skin like us? Or maybe because I have basic respect for another human's  body, and choices. I would rant about how men shift their gaze from my eyes to my neck and fixate them over my chest while we share our thoughts. I would rant about all those times when I was groped publicly and asked to not get into public bus if my body is that fragile when I raised my voice. I would rant about my senior who mistook me drinking with him as a signal. But I don't rant about these. My expectations from men have fallen so low that I have accepted ""men will be men'. So, whenever I meet a guy who treats women like human instead of an object I automatically think him to be the best man possible but all he is doing is behaving as human as possible.
What can I do? I cannot complain and not find a solution, can I?
First and foremost what is our source of knowledge about sex? Is it from the curriculum books or from packages we get over the internet? How many of us were taught reproductive health chapters in our biology classes without hesitation? I remember my science teacher skipping that chapter like it doesn't exist. Are we open about sex and intimacy with people who are younger than us? Are parents considering sitting with their younger ones and having the tough, uncomfortable talk? How exactly are teens being educated about sex?  Sex education is one of the most important factors here which not only educates the younger ones but also resolves their curious queries. In age of experiments and curiosity, we see our youngsters tempting over anything that's reckless. While teaching about sex and human anatomy, one should be taught that sex happens between two and it is basic need for human irrespective of any sex. Teaching minors about touch and how to differentiate between the good touch and the bad touch is very essential. Certain areas of body which are private and no one should have an acess to them.
We as a society, a patriarchial society, hold our daughters with rules and regulations, and invest pride, dignity of her, her family and society over the organ between her legs. How and why is it fair that the organ that enables a woman to push a new life out of her also makes her the most vulnerable? Is being a woman and having the organ and being blessed with the ability to conceive and give birth not a power of strength? But why does the same organ make her vulnerable and signifies her character? Being raped isn't her choice but raping is his choice. So why do we always accuse the victim and leave the rapist off the hook? When will we stop to put the character, dignity and pride of whole family on the fragile shoulders of our daughters? Should we not hold our son responsible instead of condoning him? We need to teach our daughters and sisters that they can go out and conquer the world and we will stick for each other no matter what. We need to teach our sons and brothers that women are not for objectification and treat them as human as possiblle
Rape happens between closed doors, mostly from people we have known or our confidants. Rapists do not have some different identity. They live among us and may be our father, uncle, brother, brother-in-law, or cousin. The rapist usually rapes because he is confident enough that the crime is usually brushed under the carpet: like nothing happened and nothing has changed. We put so much of pride over the fragile organ between our legs that most of the times the victim never opens up. The audacity of rapists increases with the practice of victim-blaming, witch-hunting and blaming the clothes.
Whatever I drape myself in, I know if someone decides to rape, I'll be raped. It's not my cloth. My cloth was never an issue. It's society we live in that gives women a position of goddess yet treat her on the basis of the organ. It's not our organ that makes us vulnerable. It's the people shaped by patriarchy that makes us vulnerable. Will society digest if I decide to lead a happy life forgetting the wounds of past? Imagine not putting the entire dignity and pride over an organ, and punishing the victim, giving women equal rights and freedom. Can you imagine a better world? Can you imagine the world where women decide her worth and not her vagina?

Nepal Sambat is one of the national calendars of Nepal traditionally associated with the Newa community and the Kathmandu Valley. It has, for the past 1,140 years, been a lunar-based calendar but recently, efforts have been made to introduce a solar calendar to bring uniformity and regularity. This year, a solar calendar was devised and released by activists which has come into effect from October 20. But, perhaps, it was a solution to an issue that nobody thought was a problem.
Nepal Sambat has been following its lunar roots for a long time and all the celebrations of festivals have followed the same calendar system ever since their inception. This means that Nepal Sambat (NS) calendar follows the phases of the moon as a basis of determining the date. This is also popularly known as ‘panchanga’ or ‘tithi’ system. Unlike the solar calendars, lunar calendars have been found to be very irregular, the cause of which may be because they do not follow the leap day system and instead rely on a leap-month system. Since NS is based on this system, the New Year’s Day for it (Nhu dan) has been usually celebrated on the day of ‘Mha Puja’ in the Newa community. This has always been a problem for many people who want to tie some event to a certain NS date, but since it keeps fluctuating, it can be highly unreliable for official usage.
A solution to this problem has recently been proposed by a few enthusiasts, which involves the adoption of the solar calendar system instead of the lunar counterpart, so that the dates become more regular. This may be seen as a great solution for the particular problem but it might in fact come as a potential problem for the Newa community that relies on the lunar calendar system to follow certain festivals. October 20 has been marked as the New Year’s Day for NS 1140, which creates a plethora of problems and disputes related to when these festivals should be celebrated.
Taking a look at how the lunar calendar system came to be the official calendar for celebrating most Newa festivals, it seems that it is the calendar system which is most in line with the seasons. This might have become so as a result of the agricultural past of the Newa community. In the past, the Newa community was a self-sustaining one where people were given different occupations based on their skills, which was passed down for generations. This also included agriculture and farming as a profession. Nepal experiences four major seasons, which made it a necessity for the farmers to majorly cultivate and produce seasonal crops. This is why it is no surprise that a few crops and dishes are prepared and consumed only on particular occasions and seasons; when the crops would have been harvested. For example, ‘quati’ is a soup which consists of nine beans and lentils, is highly nutritious and helps in boosting the immune system of the human body. This is only prepared on ‘Gum Punhi’/’Janai Purnima’ by the Newa community, which is exactly when these beans and lentils would have been harvested and produced in the past. 
In today’s modern world, people no longer need to wait for a certain occasion because of the boom of trade and there is no necessity for a self-sustaining community. However, if we look at the NS calendar predicted by the astrologers, they are still seen to be more in line with the seasons than the solar calendars, despite the effects of climate change and global warming. This knowledge of the lunar calendar is what our ancestors had left us with, and is what we base our festivals on. Changing this to a solar calendar may not be accepted by the general population because it cannot incorporate such events. A solution for this may be to incorporate the NS dates on the basis of the solar calendar but celebrate the festivals based on the lunar calendar. This seems to be the most viable solution for this problem.
However, Nepal already has its own luni-solar calendar, Bikram Sambat. Having to juggle between the Gregorian solar calendar and the Bikram Sambat alongside the lunar Nepal Sambat sounds complicated enough, so why would the general public want to adapt to the solar NS anyway? It brings nothing new to the table for the common man except additional unnecessary confusion. The step taken to establish NS as a mainstream official calendar is a welcome one, but to the eye of a common person, it may look like the solution to a problem that never existed and one that creates more confusion. To the person, it looks like a plot to rob him/her of his/her culture by making an unauthentic version of NS, official in the name of conservation of cultural heritage. 
There have always been people who have asked to make the NS the mainstream calendar for official use because other calendars do not incorporate all the festivals and occasions, but removing the festival element just to incorporate it as mainstream seems like an unwanted solution that defeats the original purpose. It may not be the most practical thing to implement NS as a mainstream calendar because it is very irregular. However, its original lunar version can be made the official calendar for festivals as a way to make it mainstream and as a step to conserve the culture that has been passed down by our ancestors. It makes more sense to do this as Bikram Sambat also has a lunar aspect already associated with it.
Taking all of the information into account, many people may not accept the solar NS calendar even if it gets the official green flag. This may create a dispute in the near future among the people in our Newa community which is the exact opposite of the original purpose of establishing a solar NS. The Newa community today seems to be very confused and hence divided when it comes to conserving the culture that has been passed down as some of it may not be largely practical in the modern world. The best way to move forward seems to be to compromise among the old values and replacing impractical ones with new values, but for most people from the older generation, change is not very acceptable and hence results in a divide in the mostly unified Newa community. This is the reason solar NS might be unacceptable for many Newa people.

Despite all the odds and uncertainties, a part of the national education system, the one run by private schools, has been able to operate for a large part of the pandemic while the vast majority of public schools have struggled since the beginning.
With infections rising throughout the country, it’s not easy to forecast an “end of the tunnel” but very probably it will take at least six more months to have widely available vaccines.
The second wave in Europe is certainly not encouraging and only very strong protocols, hardly implementable at massive scales in a country like Nepal, can be effective in controlling the spread of the virus while managing to have a semi-normal life that also includes classroom based learning.
What will be the future of the education sector in Nepal in six months from now?
Many questions remain unanswered but all go down to make some difficult calls.
Will online education be the only doable way of imparting education or will other options be available, allowing also a scaled back return to classroom-based learning?
What about the situation of community-managed schools that have, on average, considerably inferior infrastructure than their private counterparts and whose students come from less affluent families unable to provide the indispensible tools for online learning?
In case of a limited return to classroom, which procedures will be in place to ensure the safety of our students, teachers, and staff?
Considering the risks, will teachers be ready to choose between their health and livelihood?
Last but not least, what did we learn in the last six months?
There are many discussions happening as to how the schools should operate and how new safety and preventive measures will have to be enforced, and their impact on the learning process.
UNICEF is working together with governments and schools to keep children learning, and not just reopen schools but make sure schools reopen in a better way.
The federal government and the provincial counterparts have been hard-pressed to ensure that all schools, not only the privately run, are able to continue in their mission of educating the children of the nation. 
Here are a few key suggestions to slowly open school nationally in a phase wise manner:
First of all for those able to do so, online learning might be the only option available.
This will require fully understanding the working conditions of teachers that were overwhelmed by the very unique circumstances of finding themselves at home while teaching.
The situation was even more demanding for female teachers who have to complete all the household duties, look after the children, cater to the in-laws and sit down with a smile for the online classes.
The truth is that the society we live in is still very unfair to women and too many expectations are tossed at them. Female teachers should be admired and recognized for bravely coping professionally and responsibly with all the responsibilities imposed on them.
Therefore for those schools able to run online classrooms, some sort of guaranteed balancing acts should be ensured so that teachers won’t feel overwhelmed and lonely again.
On the other hand, we doubt the government will be able to provide massive numbers of computers, indispensible for online classes, to less affluent families that happen to enroll their children in community schools.
In such circumstances, we might have to think creatively with limited in-person classroom hours, mixing them with alternative forms of studying.
Wherever possible, junior school should avail of non-traditional, outside classroom learning and could come to schools only on weekends with their parents.
Other students could come alternately for only three days a week to school and this is aligned with the overall efforts of the government to minimize the working days from the normal 190 teaching days to whatever remaining days are available.
To offset the reduction in in-person teaching, local youths, after receiving appropriate trainings, could be mobilized as they can volunteer and run support classes in smaller groups either by visiting children in their homes or by arranging “one-stop temporary learning” outposts in the communities.
Harnessing on the power of youth clubs, for example, can really help teachers, especially those from community schools, to better provide meaningful learning outcomes as their duties will be shared with others.
For all schools running their own transportation services and willing to experiment a mix of in-person and online learning, special provisions should be applied, not only through continuous and exhaustive disinfection  of the vehicles but also in terms of seating arrangements with adequate distances.
This means that a less number of children will be able to travel on the same vehicle.
Yet, with students attending classroom not as regularly as before, any concerns in terms of more pollution and traffic havoc being created by more buses’ runs, will be offset because of less students being in the school premises at the same time.
Whenever students will access to face-to-face classrooms, special provisions must be put in place.
Mask must be made compulsory for all stakeholders in school and temperature check must be made mandatory for students together with hand sanitizers points at school entry and strong protocols for monitored hand-washing at regular time intervals.
This aspect of basic sanitation, often a weak point in many community schools, must be fixed and it is fair to demand local governments across the country to ensure reliable water supplies for all these schools.
In addition, the number of students in the classrooms should be drastically reduced as the average of over 30 students for one classroom constitutes a serious health hazard.
In certain circumstances, face-to-face classes should be allowed only for the senior school maintaining physical distancing as they would be careful and responsible with themselves and their peers.
It will be hard to make prioritizations on who will have more access to in-person learning but common sense and practical considerations should guide the stakeholders in their decision making.
So despite all these odds, the “Learning Show” has to go on and we better be prepared.
Teachers should be considered, to some extent, as equals to many other essential workers providing indispensible services nowadays.
Though they did not take a Hippocratic oath, their contributions during these trying times have been invaluable and deserves recognition.
We are aware that the solutions proposed here have their own shortcomings and won’t fully address all the concerns from the stakeholders.
We need to make sure that not only students enrolled in private education institutions are able to enjoy their rights to learning but also try our best to come up with innovative solutions that will allow the highest number of students, especially those from community schools, to fulfill their rights safely too.
Will everything work out perfectly?
Will stakeholders be willing to make some trade-offs in the process?
Genuine goodwill and determination will only help answer these questions and unlock the difficult conundrum on how to ensure learning of the future generations won’t be any more hampered by a virus.

After a  normal day in my residential school, I finished my classes for the day and was returning back to my residence. I came to my room, changed and opened my laptop to check the email. To my astonishment, my sister had emailed me a link and a text that read “ You need to get into this Program. Good luck”. I read every testimony from Yale Young Global Scholars (YYGS) alumni on the internet and told myself I could not miss out on this opportunity. I was initially very diffident about this program since some of the testimonials said that it’s a very selective program and required a very promising academic background. I had an average grade and moreover wasn’t confident and so I called it off instantly. A week later I logged into the portal and there was the application. And from that point, my YYGS journey started.
YYGS is a two-week academic enrichment program for outstanding high school students from around the world. YYGS empowers the global community of leaders by providing a platform to learn and build a community that fosters intellectual curiosity, deepens understanding, and inspires creative action across all borders. YYGS is renowned for its diverse and inclusive community with students coming from 130 countries (including all 50 U.S. states) and commitment to increasing education access. Founded back in 2001, it initially started with two sessions with 300 students to now having almost twelve sessions with 2,400 students.
The application process was pretty long. We had to answer several prompts. It also required our high school transcript and two letters of recommendations. I still remember how nervous I was on the day of the deadline. I checked each and every word carefully trying to avoid typos. I double-checked all the documents I had to attach. After a few seconds, I took a long breath and clicked submit. We had a couple of months before we got our decisions and I was very anxious.
On March 13th we got our decisions. As soon as I saw the email that read “ application update”, I hurried and opened the portal. I still remember the Y-letter confetti showered my desktop as I wiped my happy tears. I was thrilled and hugged my parents real tight. It was a dream come true. I was going to Yale this summer. I was four months away from living my dream. I was so excited about my visa, travelling to the USA for the first time, visiting Yale University, making friends and many more.
However, in March COVID-19 devastated the USA. Heartbreaking news from New York started pouring in and I realized this was beyond my control. All our hopes were dashed. YYGS administrators were very hopeful even when New York was ground zero for COVID-19. Deep inside I had a bit of hope. I genuinely thought things would get better by July. But after March, the United States halted international flights and the US Consulate in Kathmandu stopped issuing visas. Soon, things got ugly in Kathmandu and we were in lockdown too. By mid-April, YYGS released their decision of cancelling YYGS’20.
For a second I thought all my hard work went in vain. But fortunately, those of us who could defer were deferred to YYGS’21 and YYGS students who were identified as high school juniors were given an option to request a spot in their new pilot online program - “YYGS Connect”
I was eligible for YYGS Connect, but I was having second thoughts. I had never attended an online class. Given the infrastructure in my country, it was challenging to attend an online class as we do not have a reliable power supply and internet connection.
Also, I was concerned about missing the social aspect of the program. I told myself, this would only give me screen fatigue and nothing else. I told my elder sister all my thoughts and she got so furious. She told me how I was lucky enough to be selected for YYGS Connect. She told me that the choice was mine, but I had to make the right decision. Later, after she put some sense in my head I accepted the offer and made the best of my life.
I attended the “Solving Global Challenges Session III” seminar. We had two sessions. The first one was “The Unfair Race” by Emilie Kilfoil. This seminar explored the cycle of poverty and why breaking it is so complex. We discussed how families trapped in the cycle of poverty have either limited or no resources. We also came to the conclusion that affirmative action at some point is very important and justifiable. We listened to American philosopher, Judith Jarvis Thomson and Robert Nozick and their stands on positive discrimination. Our instructor then gave us prompts and made us discuss each one in the breakout rooms. We had a very intense discussion. I was so surprised by the diversity of the opinions that came up during the discussion. We had group presentations and our instructor gave us feedback. This session helped me explore new ideas. In Nepal, we are always told to work hard to get out of the cycle of poverty. After this session, I have a counter-argument for people who hold on to this thought. One can’t get out of the cycle of poverty simply because of hard work. Our society and system are rigged; it works against the poor and is made to favor the rich. So unless we make some systemic changes. Hard work alone won't break the cycle of poverty.
The second session was “The Water War” by Nora Massie.  In this session, we discussed Tony Allan’s idea of Virtual Water. There are around 250 rivers in the world that run through two or more countries and interstates which could cause regional conflict. Water issues could also exacerbate political issues. We also concluded that water can be a bridge to peace in the warring countries. We examined the graphs and calculated the water potential of each country.
Other than the seminars, we also got the opportunity to virtually attend the lectures from professors across Yale University. We also had a question/answer session with them. We discussed how in today’s world, industries use and discard enormous amounts of toxic materials, water and energy in the environment. I had never thought about the resources required for a simple object I use in my daily life.
 In a lecture, we listened and discussed the testimonies of the soldiers who rescued the Jews from the concentration camps during the World War II. Each and every discussion in the breakout rooms were so meaningful and had a profound effect on me. Simulations gave us the strength to deal with the on-going pandemic and ways we could be useful in our community during these difficult times.
YYGS has been a very wholesome experience for me. YYGS  gave me a new perspective to perceive the world. I learned the value of diversity and heard from students from 130 countries. Even though we had diverse opinions, I was able to respect peer opinions and they valued my perspective too. This has piqued my intellectual curiosity and deepened my understanding of world issues.
Given my background, my journey to YYGS speaks volume about the inclusive and holistic selection process of YYGS.  I hope my experience motivates others to apply to this program. Applications for YYGS’21 is already out now. I would like to encourage every high school student to apply to this program.

President Xi JInping warned against meddling in China’s dealings with Taiwan during a phone call with his U.S. counterpart, Joe Biden, that gave no indication of progress on trade, technology or other irritants, including Beijing’s opposition to a top American lawmaker’s possible visit to the island democracy, which the mainland claims as its own territory.
Xi also warned against splitting the world’s two biggest economies, according to a Chinese government summary of Thursday’s unusually lengthy, three-hour call. Businesspeople and economists warn such a change, brought on by Chinese industrial policy and U.S. curbs on technology exports, might hurt the global economy by slowing innovation and increasing costs.
Meanwhile, Xi and Biden are looking at the possibility of meeting in person, according to a U.S. official who declined to be identified further. Xi has been invited to Indonesia in November for a meeting of the Group of 20 major economies, making it a potential location for a face-to-face meeting.
The Chinese government gave no indication Xi and Biden discussed possible plans by U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to visit Taiwan, which the ruling Communist Party says has no right to conduct foreign relations. But Xi rejected “interference by external forces” that might encourage Taiwan to try to make its decades-old de facto independence permanent.
“Resolutely safeguarding China’s national sovereignty and territorial integrity is the firm will of the more than 1.4 billion Chinese people,” said the statement. “Those who play with fire will perish by it.”
The tough language from Xi, who usually tries to appear to be above political disputes and makes blandly positive public comments, suggested Chinese leaders might believe Washington didn’t understand the seriousness of previous warnings about Taiwan.
Taiwan and China split in 1949 following a civil war that ended with a Communist victory on the mainland. They have no official relations but are linked by billions of dollars of trade and investment. Both sides say they are one country but disagree over which government is entitled to national leadership.
A Ministry of Defense spokesman said ahead of Thursday’s call that Washington “must not arrange for Pelosi to visit Taiwan.” He said the ruling party’s military wing, the People’s Liberation Army, would take “strong measures to thwart any external interference.”
Xi called on the United States to “honor the one-China principle,” the statement said, referring to Beijing’s position that the mainland and Taiwan are one country. The United States, by contrast, has a “one-China policy” that says Washington takes no position on the question but wants to see it resolved peacefully.
“Both sides of the Taiwan Strait belong to one and the same China,” the statement said.
The statement cited Biden as saying the United States doesn’t support independence for Taiwan.
Coverage of the conversation in China’s entirely state-controlled media on Friday was limited to repeating government statements.
Pelosi has yet to confirm whether she will go to Taiwan, but if she does, the Democrat from California would be the highest-ranking elected American official to visit since then-Speaker Newt Gingrich in 1997.
Beijing criticized Gingrich for saying the United States would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese attack but did little else in response to his three-hour visit to the island.
Since then, China’s position on Taiwan has hardened as the mainland economy grew to become second-largest after the United States. The ruling party poured hundreds of billions of dollars into developing fighter jets and other high-tech weapons including “carrier killer” missiles that are thought to be intended to block the U.S. Navy from helping to defend the island.
The conflict over a possible Pelosi visit is more sensitive to Beijing in a year when Xi, who took power in 2012, is expected to try to break with tradition and award himself a third five-year term as party leader.
Xi, who wants to be seen as restoring China’s rightful historic role as a global leader, has promoted a more assertive policy abroad. The PLA has sent growing numbers of fighter planes and bombers to fly near Taiwan in an attempt to intimidate its democratically elected government.
The United States has no official relations with Taiwan but has extensive commercial ties and informal political connections. Washington is obliged by federal law to see that Taiwan has the means to defend itself.
Xi called for cooperation on reducing the risk of economic recession, coordinating macroeconomic policies, fighting COVID-19 and “de-escalation of regional hot spots,” according to the government statement.
He also warned against decoupling, or separating, the U.S. and Chinese economies for strategic reasons.
Businesspeople and industry analysts have warned global industries might be split into separate markets with incompatible products due to China’s pressure on its own companies to develop their own technology standards and U.S. restrictions on Chinese access to technology that Washington see as a security risk. That might slow innovation and increase costs.
“Attempts at decoupling or severing supply chains in defiance of underlying laws would not help boost the U.S. economy,” the statement said. “They would only make the world economy more vulnerable.”

President Xi JInping warned against meddling in China’s dealings with Taiwan during a phone call with his U.S. counterpart, Joe Biden, that gave no indication of progress on trade, technology or other irritants, including Beijing’s opposition to a top American lawmaker’s possible visit to the island democracy, which the mainland claims as its own territory.
Xi also warned against splitting the world’s two biggest economies, according to a Chinese government summary of Thursday’s unusually lengthy, three-hour call. Businesspeople and economists warn such a change, brought on by Chinese industrial policy and U.S. curbs on technology exports, might hurt the global economy by slowing innovation and increasing costs.
Meanwhile, Xi and Biden are looking at the possibility of meeting in person, according to a U.S. official who declined to be identified further. Xi has been invited to Indonesia in November for a meeting of the Group of 20 major economies, making it a potential location for a face-to-face meeting.
The Chinese government gave no indication Xi and Biden discussed possible plans by U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to visit Taiwan, which the ruling Communist Party says has no right to conduct foreign relations. But Xi rejected “interference by external forces” that might encourage Taiwan to try to make its decades-old de facto independence permanent.
“Resolutely safeguarding China’s national sovereignty and territorial integrity is the firm will of the more than 1.4 billion Chinese people,” said the statement. “Those who play with fire will perish by it.”
The tough language from Xi, who usually tries to appear to be above political disputes and makes blandly positive public comments, suggested Chinese leaders might believe Washington didn’t understand the seriousness of previous warnings about Taiwan.
Taiwan and China split in 1949 following a civil war that ended with a Communist victory on the mainland. They have no official relations but are linked by billions of dollars of trade and investment. Both sides say they are one country but disagree over which government is entitled to national leadership.
A Ministry of Defense spokesman said ahead of Thursday’s call that Washington “must not arrange for Pelosi to visit Taiwan.” He said the ruling party’s military wing, the People’s Liberation Army, would take “strong measures to thwart any external interference.”
Xi called on the United States to “honor the one-China principle,” the statement said, referring to Beijing’s position that the mainland and Taiwan are one country. The United States, by contrast, has a “one-China policy” that says Washington takes no position on the question but wants to see it resolved peacefully.
“Both sides of the Taiwan Strait belong to one and the same China,” the statement said.
The statement cited Biden as saying the United States doesn’t support independence for Taiwan.
Coverage of the conversation in China’s entirely state-controlled media on Friday was limited to repeating government statements.
Pelosi has yet to confirm whether she will go to Taiwan, but if she does, the Democrat from California would be the highest-ranking elected American official to visit since then-Speaker Newt Gingrich in 1997.
Beijing criticized Gingrich for saying the United States would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese attack but did little else in response to his three-hour visit to the island.
Since then, China’s position on Taiwan has hardened as the mainland economy grew to become second-largest after the United States. The ruling party poured hundreds of billions of dollars into developing fighter jets and other high-tech weapons including “carrier killer” missiles that are thought to be intended to block the U.S. Navy from helping to defend the island.
The conflict over a possible Pelosi visit is more sensitive to Beijing in a year when Xi, who took power in 2012, is expected to try to break with tradition and award himself a third five-year term as party leader.
Xi, who wants to be seen as restoring China’s rightful historic role as a global leader, has promoted a more assertive policy abroad. The PLA has sent growing numbers of fighter planes and bombers to fly near Taiwan in an attempt to intimidate its democratically elected government.
The United States has no official relations with Taiwan but has extensive commercial ties and informal political connections. Washington is obliged by federal law to see that Taiwan has the means to defend itself.
Xi called for cooperation on reducing the risk of economic recession, coordinating macroeconomic policies, fighting COVID-19 and “de-escalation of regional hot spots,” according to the government statement.
He also warned against decoupling, or separating, the U.S. and Chinese economies for strategic reasons.

Chinese leader Xi Jinping called Thursday for peace talks over Ukraine after French President Emmanuel Macron appealed to him to “bring Russia to its senses,” but Xi gave no indication Beijing would use its leverage as Vladimir Putin’s diplomatic partner to press for a settlement.
Xi gave no sign China, which declared it had a “no limits friendship” with Moscow before last year’s invasion, had changed its stance since calling for peace talks in February.
“Peace talks should resume as soon as possible,” Xi said. He called on other governments to avoid doing anything that might “make the crisis deteriorate or even get out of control.”
Beijing, which sees Moscow as a partner in opposing U.S. domination of global affairs, has tried to appear neutral in the conflict but has given Putin diplomatic support and repeated Russian justifications for the February 2022 attack. Xi received an effusive welcome from Putin when he visited Moscow last month, giving the isolated Russian president a political boost.
The Chinese leader said “legitimate security concerns of all parties” should be considered, a reference to Moscow’s argument that it attacked Ukraine because of the eastward expansion of NATO, the U.S.-European military alliance.
During talks earlier, Macron appealed to Xi to “bring Russia to its senses and bring everyone back to the negotiating table.”
Macron pointed to Chinese support for the United Nations Charter, which calls for respect of a country’s territorial integrity. He said Putin’s announcement of plans to deploy nuclear weapons in Belarus violated international agreements and commitments to Xi’s government.
“We need to find a lasting peace,” the French president said. “I believe that this is also an important issue for China.”
Macron was accompanied to Beijing by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in a show of European unity.
Von der Leyen said she encouraged Xi to call Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and the Chinese leader “reiterated his willingness to speak when conditions and time are right.”
“I think this is a positive element,” von der Leyen said.
Von der Leyen warned China against sending military equipment to Russia, echoing a warning Wednesday by NATO’s 31 member governments of “severe consequences” for shipments of weapons or ammunition.
“Arming the aggressor is a clear violation of international law,” von der Leyen said. “This would indeed significantly harm the relationship between the European Union and China.”
China is the biggest buyer of Russian oil and gas, which helps prop up the Kremlin’s revenue in the face of Western sanctions. That increases Chinese influence, but Xi appears reluctant to jeopardize that partnership by pressuring Putin.
“China has always adhered to an objective and fair position on the issue of the Ukraine crisis,” said a Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Mao Ning. “We have been an advocate of a political solution to the crisis and a promoter of peace talks.”
Also Wednesday, the French and Chinese governments announced agreements including the purchase of 160 Airbus aircraft by a Chinese leasing company and for their companies to collaborate on nuclear, solar, wind power and biofuel development.

Iran’s semiofficial news agency ISNA reported Thursday that Saudi Arabia and Iran agreed to reopen diplomatic missions in their respective capitals and in additional cities. There was no immediate official confirmation of the report.
As part of the reported deal, the two sides would also study the prospects of resuming flights between the two nations and facilitating the visa process for the citizens of both countries. Saudi Arabia and Iran are longtime regional rivals, but have moved toward reconciliation as part of a deal brokered by China last month.
If confirmed, the agreement would represent a new step toward reconciliation after seven years of tension. The rapprochement, which was initiated last month, lowers the chance of armed conflict between the Mideast rivals – both directly and in proxy conflicts around the region.
The initial reconciliation agreement was brokered by Beijing in March.
It represents a major diplomatic victory for the Chinese as Gulf Arab states perceive the United States slowly withdrawing from the wider Middle East. It also comes as diplomats have been trying to end a long war in Yemen, a conflict in which both Iran and Saudi Arabia are deeply entrenched.
On Thursday morning, Saudi Arabia’s state-run Al-Ekhbariya TV showed Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud and his Iranian counterpart, Hossein Amirabdollahian, shaking hands and sitting side by side. Iran’s state TV said the two ministers met to discuss the details of reopening embassies.
It was the first formal meeting of senior diplomats from the two nations since 2016, when the kingdom broke ties with Iran after protesters invaded Saudi diplomatic posts there. Saudi Arabia had executed a prominent Shiite cleric with 46 others days earlier, triggering the demonstrations.

French President Emmanuel Macron said Wednesday he wants to “engage China toward a shared responsibility for peace” in Ukraine when he meets Chinese leader Xi Jinping this week.
French officials said earlier that Macron planned to urge Xi in talks Thursday to use Beijing’s influence with Russian President Vladimir Putin, but didn’t expect a big shift in the Chinese position.
Macron is to be accompanied by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in a show of European unity in dealings with Beijing.
Xi and Putin declared their governments had a “no limits friendship” before Moscow’s February 2022 attack on Ukraine. Beijing has refused to criticize the Kremlin but has tried to appear neutral and has called for a cease-fire and peace talks.
In a speech to French residents of China, Macron said he would “try to build, and somehow engage China toward a shared responsibility for peace and stability on international issues” including Ukraine, Iran and North Korea.
Macron expressed hope China will “participate in initiatives that are useful to the Ukrainian people.”
“Dialogue with China is indispensable,” Macron said during the event at the French Embassy.
Xi’s government sees Russia as a source of energy and as a partner in opposing what both say is U.S. domination of global affairs.
China is the biggest buyer of Russian oil and gas, which helps to prop up the Kremlin’s revenue in the face of Western sanctions. That increases Chinese influence, but Xi appears reluctant to jeopardize that partnership by pressuring Putin.
Macron noted Putin’s announcement that Moscow plans to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, which China opposes.
“Territorial integrity, the sovereignty of nations is part” of the Charter of the United Nations, which China affirmed, Macron said.
Defending those principles “means moving forward together and trying to find a path for peace,” Macron said. He noted China proposed a peace plan in February and that while France doesn’t fully agree with it, the plan “shows a will to commit toward the resolution of the conflict.”
Meanwhile, NATO’s 31 member countries warned Wednesday of “severe consequences” should China start sending weapons and ammunition to Russia.
“Allies have been clear that any provision of lethal aid by China to Russia would be a historic mistake, with profound implications,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters after chairing a meeting of the organization’s foreign ministers in Brussels.
Stoltenberg declined to say what the implications of such a move might be, but warned only that it would involve “severe consequences.”
“At a time when Beijing and Moscow are pushing back against the rules-based international order, it is even more important that we continue to stand together,” he said.
Last week, von der Leyen warned the European Union must be prepared to develop measures to protect trade and investment that China might exploit for its own security and military purposes.
Thierry Breton, EU commissioner for internal market, said Monday on French news broadcaster FranceInfo the message to Chinese authorities is that they “must stop trying to play one country against another.”
Macron also said “several major deals” were due to be signed between French and Chinese companies during the visit. He was accompanied by more than 50 French CEOs including from Airbus, railway equipment manufacturer Alstom and energy giant EDF.
A French official said last week negotiations were underway on a potential deal with Airbus that would come on top of China’s 2019 order for 300 aircraft.
Macron said he will push for “working in partnership” with China on climate. He said France will organize a global conference on the protection of oceans in 2025 and said China should be part of these efforts.

 A man with a hatchet burst into a day care center Wednesday in Brazil, killing four children, authorities said, in an attack that shook the country and put pressure on the government to curb a rising tide of violence.
At least four other children were wounded in the attack in Blumenau, a city of 366,000 in southern Brazil, near the Atlantic coast.
The assailant, who got inside by jumping over a wall, turned himself in at a police station, officials said. He did not appear to have any connection with the center, which offers nursery services, preschool education and after-school activities. The dead were between the ages of 5 and 7, authorities said.
Authorities were searching for a motive, the police detective leading the investigation, Ronnie Esteves, told television reporters.
Hours after the attack, the justice and education ministers pledged to invest in new violence-prevention efforts.
Valeria Aparecida Camilo, the mother of 5-year-old girl at the center, said she was working when a colleague saw the news. She called her husband, Gustavo, who rushed to the school and later learned that his daughter had survived.
“The moment I saw her, it was a relief,” Gustavo Camilo told The Associated Press outside the center. “But we feel sorry for everything that has happened, with the other kids who wound up dying.”
“They have no cruelty, they’re kids,” Valeria added. “They’re 5 years old. What did a 5-year-old do to this person?”
Franciele Chequeto said one of the girls killed was friends with her 7-year-old son, Gabriel.
“He wasn’t understanding,” Chequeto said. “I sat down and told him that he no longer will be able to see some of his little friends.”
The state’s civil police chief, Ulisses Gabriel, confirmed that the attacker was a 25-year-old man from neighboring Parana state. He will be charged with murder and attempted murder. Police believe the attack was an isolated act and not related to any other crimes, Gabriel said.
Images broadcast on networks showed weeping parents outside the private day care center called Cantinho do Bom Pastor.
The attack took place on the center’s playground, according to the local affiliate of television network Globo. NSC, the affiliate, showed a photo of the suspect with a closely shaved head. Police have yet to confirm his identity.
Blumenau’s mayor, Mário Hildebrandt, suspended classes and said he will declare a 30-day mourning period. Authorities said any reports of other attacks or threats against schools in the region were false.
School attacks in Brazil have happened with greater frequency in recent years. Last week, a student in Sao Paulo fatally stabbed a teacher and wounded several others in Sao Paulo.
Brazil has seen at least one past attack on a day care center. That attack also occurred in Santa Catarina state, in May 2021, when an assailant used a dagger to kill three children under 2 years old and two adults.
From 2000 to 2022, 16 attacks or violent episodes happened in schools, four of them in the second half of last year, according to a report from researchers led by Daniel Cara, an education professor at the University of Sao Paulo. The 12 researchers — comprised of psychologists, social scientists, public school educators, journalists and activists — prepared the report for the government of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
Brazilian Justice Minister Flávio Dino told reporters in Brasilia that he was directing 150 million reais ($30 million) from the nation’s public security fund to shore up school safety. That money will pay for both heightened policing and an expansion of a Brasilia-based team for the monitoring of deep-web communities, he said. Earlier Wednesday, Dino met with representatives from student associations.
Meanwhile, Education Minister Camilo Santana announced the creation of a group to address school violence. Santana will lead the group, which is scheduled to meet for the first time Thursday.
There is no single factor to explain the rise of such attacks, but a common denominator is what Cara calls “a crisis of perspective” regarding economic problems and the likelihood that each assailant endured situations of frustration and violence, including bullying and harassment.
“Given the lack of perspective and the way they were victimized,” they get recruited by online communities and seek a way to take revenge on society, Cara told the AP by phone.
“They are usually young people who have a masculinist, misogynistic, racist discourse, who worship neo-Nazi and fascist symbols, and who navigate in communities where violence is glorified,” Cara added.
Experts say April is a particularly sensitive month for school attacks as it concentrates the anniversaries of the 1999 Columbine school shooting in the U.S. and a shooting in a school in Rio de Janeiro’s metropolitan area in 2011. These events are glorified in violent communities and can act as triggers for new attacks, Cara said.
“There are no words to console the families. Anyone who has lost a relative knows that there are no words,” a teary-eyed President Lula said Wednesday at the outset of a ministerial meeting. He requested his ministers observe a minute of silence.
In 2019, a bacterial infection claimed the life of Lula’s grandson, who was 7 years old — the same age as one of the victims in Blumenau.

Donald Trump conspired to undermine the 2016 election through a series of hush money payments designed to stifle claims that could be harmful to his candidacy, prosecutors said Tuesday in unsealing a historic 34-count felony indictment against the former president.
Trump, stone-faced and silent as he entered and exited the Manhattan courtroom, said “not guilty” in a firm voice while facing a judge who warned him to refrain from rhetoric that could inflame or cause civil unrest.
The broad contours of the case have long been known, but the 16-page indictment contains new details about a scheme that prosecutors say involved multiple payoffs to two women, including a porn star, who said they had extramarital sexual encounters with him years earlier, as well as to a Trump Tower doorman who claimed to have a story about a child he alleged the former president had out of of wedlock.
The arraignment, though largely procedural in nature, amounts to a remarkable reckoning for Trump after years of investigations into his personal, business and political dealings. The case is unfolding against the backdrop not only of his third campaign for the White House but also against other investigations in Washington and Atlanta that might yet produce even more charges.
Trump, his lips pursed in apparent anger, entered the courtroom shortly before 2:30 p.m. He left court about an hour later, also without commenting. All told, the voluble Trump spoke only about 10 words during the entire proceeding.
Before the arraignment, he narrated his feelings in real time, describing the experience as “SURREAL” as he traveled from Trump Tower to lower Manhattan to face a judge.
It represents the new split-screen reality for Trump as he submits to the dour demands of the American criminal justice system while projecting an aura of defiance and victimhood at celebratory campaign events.
Wearing his signature dark suit and red tie, Trump turned and waved to crowds outside the building before heading inside to be fingerprinted and processed. He arrived at court in an eight-car motorcade from Trump Tower, communicating in real time his anger at the process.
“Heading to Lower Manhattan, the Courthouse,” he posted on his Truth Social platform. “Seems so SURREAL — WOW, they are going to ARREST ME. Can’t believe this is happening in America. MAGA!”
Trump, who was impeached twice by the U.S. House but was never convicted in the U.S. Senate, is the first former president to face criminal charges. The nation’s 45th commander in chief was escorted from Trump Tower to the courthouse by the Secret Service.
“He is strong and ready to go,” Trump lawyer Joe Tacopina told The Associated Press. Earlier, Tacopina said in a TV interview that the former president wouldn’t plead guilty to lesser charges, even if it might resolve the case. He also said he didn’t think the case would make it to a jury.
New York police said they were ready for large protests by Trump supporters, who share the Republican former president’s belief that the New York grand jury indictment and three additional pending investigations are politically motivated and intended to weaken his bid to retake the White House in 2024. Journalists often outnumbered protesters, though.
Trump, a former reality TV star, has been hyping that narrative to his political advantage, saying he raised more than $8 million in the days since the indictment on claims of a “witch hunt.” His campaign released a fundraising request titled “My last email before arrest” and he has repeatedly assailed Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, egged on supporters to protest and claimed without evidence that the judge presiding over the case “hates me” — something his own lawyer has said is not true.
Trump was scheduled to return to his Palm Beach, Florida, home, Mar-a-Lago, on Tuesday evening to give remarks. At least 500 prominent supporters have been invited, with some of the most pro-Trump congressional Republicans expected to attend.
A conviction would not prevent Trump from running for or winning the presidency in 2024.
The investigation is scrutinizing six-figure payments made to porn actor Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal. Both say they had sexual encounters with the married Trump years before he got into politics. Trump denies having sexual liaisons with either woman and has denied any wrongdoing involving payments.
The arraignment unfolded against the backdrop of heavy security in New York, coming more than two years after Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol in a failed bid to halt the congressional certification of Democrat Joe Biden’s win.
Trump was defiant ahead of his arraignment. He used his social media network to complain that he was going to court in a heavily Democratic area, declaring, “KANGAROO COURT” and “THIS IS NOT WHAT AMERICA WAS SUPPOSED TO BE!” He and his campaign have repeatedly assailed Bragg and even trained scrutiny on members of Bragg’s family.
Despite that, the scenes around Trump Tower and the courthouse where Trump will stand before a judge did not feature major unrest. Police tried to keep apart protesters supporting the former president and those opposing him by confining them to separate sides of a park near the courthouse using metal barricades.
Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, one of Trump’s staunchest supporters in Congress, staged a brief rally at the park, but the scene was so chaotic that it was hard to hear her over the crush of reporters and protesters.
“We’re the party of peace,” Greene said, thanking those Trump supporters present. “Democrats are communists.”
Embattled Republican New York Rep. George Santos also showed up in solidarity with Trump, saying, “I want to support the president.”
“I think this is unprecedented and it’s a bad day for democracy,” Santos said, suggesting that future prosecutors could target Biden and other presidents with other cases, which “cheapens the judicial system.”
New York’s ability to carry out safe and drama-free courthouse proceedings in a case involving a polarizing ex-president could be an important test case as prosecutors in Atlanta and Washington conduct their own investigations of Trump that could also result in charges. Those investigations concern efforts to undo the 2020 election results as well as the possible mishandling of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago.

Finland joined the NATO military alliance Tuesday, dealing a major blow to Russian President Vladimir Putin with a historic realignment of Europe’s post-Cold War security landscape triggered by Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.
The Nordic country’s membership doubles Russia’s border with the world’s biggest security alliance. Finland had adopted neutrality after its defeat by the Soviets in World War II, but its leaders signaled they wanted to join NATO after Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine sent a shiver of fear through its neighbors.
“The era of nonalignment in our history has come to an end -– a new era begins,” President Sauli Niinistö said before his country’s blue-and-white flag was raised outside NATO headquarters. A short distance away, outside the security fence, a few dozen people wrapped in flags of their own chanted, “Ukraine needs NATO.”
In praising Finland’s membership, U.S. President Joe Biden noted it came on the 74th anniversary of the signing of NATO’s founding treaty on April 4, 1949.
“When Putin launched his brutal war of aggression against the people of Ukraine, he thought he could divide Europe and NATO. He was wrong,” Biden said in a statement. “Today, we are more united than ever. And together — strengthened by our newest ally, Finland — we will continue to preserve transatlantic security, defend every inch of NATO territory, and meet any and all challenges we face.”
The move is a strategic and political setback for Putin, who has long complained about NATO’s expansion toward Russia and partly used that as a justification for the invasion.
“I’m tempted to say this is maybe the one thing that we can thank Mr. Putin for because he once again here precipitated something he claims to want to prevent by Russia’s aggression, causing many countries to believe that they have to do more to look out for their own defense and to make sure that they can deter possible Russian aggression going forward,” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said before accepting the documents that made Finland’s membership official.
The U.S. State Department is the repository of NATO texts concerning membership.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy sent his congratulations to Finland, writing on Telegram that “amid Russian aggression, the Alliance became the only effective guarantee of security in the region.”
Russia warned it would be forced to take “retaliatory measures” to address what it called security threats created by Finland’s membership. It had also warned it would bolster forces near Finland if NATO sends any additional troops or equipment to what is its 31st member country.
The alliance says it poses no threat to Moscow.
Alarmed by Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine last year, Finland, which shares a 1,340 kilometer (832 mile) border with Russia, applied to join in May, seeking protection under the organization’s security umbrella.
“Russia tried to create a sphere around them and, well, we are not a sphere. I’m sure that Finns themselves feel more secure, that we are living in a more stable world,” Niinisto said.
Neighboring Sweden, which has avoided military alliances for more than 200 years, has also applied. But objections from NATO members Turkey and Hungary have delayed the process.
Niinisto said Finland’s membership “is not complete without that of Sweden. The persistent efforts for a rapid Swedish membership continue.“ Finland even gave its ratification of Sweden’s application to Blinken as it joined.
In Stockholm, Swedish Defense Minister Pål Jonson congratulated Finland and said he believed it would improve Sweden’s security but added that “it’s no secret that we would like to have concluded it hand-in-hand.”
Earlier, Russia’s Foreign Ministry said Moscow “will be forced to take military-technical and other retaliatory measures to counter the threats to our national security arising from Finland’s accession to NATO.”
It said Finland’s move marks “a fundamental change in the situation in Northern Europe, which had previously been one of the most stable regions in the world.”
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Finland’s membership reflects the alliance’s anti-Russian course and warned that Moscow will respond depending on what weapons NATO allies place there. But he also sought to play down the impact, noting that Russia has no territorial disputes with Finland.
It’s not clear what additional military resources Russia could send to the Finnish border. Moscow has deployed the bulk of its most capable military units to Ukraine.
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said no more troops would be sent to Finland unless it asked for help.
The country is now protected by what Stoltenberg called NATO’s “iron-clad security guarantee,” under which all member countries vow to come to the defense of any ally that comes under attack.
But Stoltenberg refused to rule out the possibility of holding more military exercises there and said that NATO would not allow Russia’s demands to dictate the organization’s decisions.
“We are constantly assessing our posture, our presence. We have more exercises, we have more presence, also in the Nordic area,” he said.
In 1939 and 1940, Finland’s tiny, ill-equipped forces fought in what became known as the Winter War against the Soviet Union. Over an exceptionally cold winter, Finnish fighters, sometimes cloaked in white bedsheets for camouflage and typically moving unseen on foot, snowshoes and skis, lost some territory to Moscow but forced out the invaders.
Finland says it can muster a 280,000-strong fighting force, built on near-universal male conscription and a large, well-trained reserve, equipped with modern artillery, warplanes and tanks. The country of 5.5 million joined the European Union in 1995,
Finland’s Parliament, meanwhile, said its website was hit with a so-called denial-of-service attack, which made the site hard to use, with many pages not loading and some functions not available.
A pro-Russian hacker group known as NoName057 (16) claimed responsibility, saying the attack was retaliation for Finland joining NATO. The claim could not be immediately verified.
The hacker group, which has reportedly acted on Moscow’s orders, has taken part in a slew of cyberattacks on the U.S. and its allies in the past. Finnish public broadcaster YLE said the same group hit the Parliament’s site last year.

Finland is poised to join NATO on Tuesday, a historic realignment triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, but the head of the military alliance said no more troops would be sent to the Nordic country unless it asked for help.
Russia warned that it would be forced to take “retaliatory measures” to address what it called security threats created by Finland’s membership. It had already warned that it would bolster defenses along its border with NATO if the alliance deploys any additional troops or equipment to its new member.
“There will be no NATO troops in Finland without the consent of Finland,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters at the alliance’s headquarters in Brussels a few hours before the country joins.
But he refused to rule out the possibility of holding more military exercises there and said that NATO would not allow Russia’s demands to dictate the organization’s decisions.
“We are constantly assessing our posture, our presence. We have more exercises, we have more presence, also in the Nordic area,” he said.
Later Tuesday, Finland is set to officially become the 31st member of NATO and take its place among the ranks of the world’s biggest security alliance.
Alarmed by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last year, Finland applied to join in May, setting aside years of military non-alignment to seek protection under the organization’s security umbrella. Neighboring Sweden also applied, but its accession process may take a few months longer.
Finland shares a 1,340 kilometer (832 mile) border with Russia, so its entry will more than double the size of NATO’s border with Russia. The move is a strategic and political blow to President Vladimir Putin, who has long complained about NATO’s expansion toward Russia — though the alliance says it poses no threat to Moscow.
“The Russian Federation will be forced to take military-technical and other retaliatory measures to counter the threats to our national security arising from Finland’s accession to NATO,” the Foreign Ministry warned in a statement.
It said Finland’s move marks “a fundamental change in the situation in Northern Europe, which had previously been one of the most stable regions in the world.”
Earlier, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Tuesday that Finland’s membership reflects the alliance’s anti-Russian course and warned that Moscow will respond depending on what weapons NATO allies place there.
But Peskov also sought to play down the impact, noting that Russia has no territorial disputes with Finland.
It’s not clear what additional military resources Russia could send to the Finnish border. Moscow has deployed the bulk of its most capable military units to Ukraine.
Stoltenberg said that once it joins, Finland will benefit from NATO’s “iron-clad security guarantee,” under which all member countries vow to come to the defense of any ally that comes under attack.
“By (Finland) become a full-fledged member, we are removing the room for miscalculation in Moscow about NATO’s readiness to protect Finland, and that makes Finland safer and stronger, and all of us safer,” Stoltenberg said.
Finland’s entry, to be marked with a flag-raising ceremony at NATO headquarters, falls on the organization’s very own birthday, the 74th anniversary of the signing of its founding Washington Treaty on April 4, 1949. It also coincides with a meeting of the alliance’s foreign ministers.
Finland’s president, foreign and defense ministers will take part in the ceremony.
Turkey became the last NATO member country to ratify Finland’s membership protocol on Thursday. It will hand over the document officially enshrining that decision to U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken before the ceremony.
Finland’s membership becomes official when its own foreign minister hands over documents completing its accession process to Blinken. The U.S. State Department is the repository of NATO texts concerning membership.

Elon Musk had promised to take away all of Twitter’s blue check marks doled out to Hollywood stars, professional athletes, business leaders, authors and journalists unless they start buying a monthly subscription to the social media service.
Musk’s goal was to shove the advertising-dependent platform he bought for $44 billion last year into a pay-to-play model — and maybe antagonize some enemies and fellow elites in the process.
But the Saturday deadline passed and the blue checks are still there, many with a new disclaimer explaining they might have been paid for or they might not have been paid for — nobody but Twitter really knows. The company didn’t return a request to clarify its changing policies Monday.
DOES A BLUE CHECK MATTER?
Matt Darling has been on Twitter for about 15 years and never cared about not having a blue check, though he’d get a kick out of whenever a verified account of “some real-world importance” started following him.
“People on Twitter will joke about blue checks like they’re the aristocracy but I don’t think anyone actually thought that,” except for Musk, Darling said.
Now, Darling finally got a blue check after paying $11 last month to try out some of the features that come with a Twitter Blue subscription. But seeing it becoming more of a “scarlet letter” under Musk than a symbol of credibility, he used a technique to scrub the blue tick from his profile.
“Now it’s a signal of you’re a person who’s not making good tweets so you have to pay for engagement,” said Darling, an economist at the center-right Niskanen Center.
Musk has said that starting April 15, only verified accounts will appear in Twitter’s For You feed that recommends what tweets people see. Darling is planning to drop the subscription — it had too many glitches, and he’s not looking for more online clout.
“I don’t want Twitter to be pay-for-play. I want it to be a place where people writing interesting tweets are getting the engagement,” he said.
HYBRID MODEL
Instead of taking away the blue check marks, Twitter on Sunday began appending a new message to profiles: “This account is verified because it’s subscribed to Twitter blue or is a legacy verified account.”
In other words, singer Dionne Warwick and other high-profile verified users still have their blue checks. But so does anyone who pays between $8 and $11 a month for a Twitter Blue subscription — and there’s no way to tell the difference. (Warwick, for her part, made clear she won’t be paying for a blue check because that money will “be going towards my extra hot lattes.”)
That hybrid solution was good enough for Star Trek actor William Shatner, who earlier balked at signing up for a subscription but on Sunday tweeted to Musk: “I can live with this. This is a good compromise”. But it’s not clear if it is a temporary or permanent measure.
THE EXCEPTION
Twitter did take away at least one verified check over the weekend: from the main account of the New York Times. The account, which has 55 million followers, had previously been marked with a gold-colored check for verified organizations.
But a user pointed out to Musk over the weekend that the newspaper had said publicly it wouldn’t be paying a monthly fee for check-mark status, so Musk said he would remove the mark and also disparaged the newspaper’s reporting.

An extraordinary moment in U.S. history is scheduled to unfold in a Manhattan courthouse Tuesday: Former US President Donald Trump, who faces multiple election-related investigations, will surrender to face criminal charges stemming from 2016 hush money payments.
The booking and arraignment are likely to be relatively brief — though hardly routine — as Trump is fingerprinted, learns the exact charges against him and pleads, as expected, not guilty.
Trump, who was impeached twice by the U.S. House but was never convicted in the U.S. Senate, will become the first former president to face criminal charges. The nation’s 45th commander in chief will be escorted from Trump Tower to the courthouse by the Secret Service and may have his mug shot taken.
New York police are braced for protests by Trump supporters, who share the former president’s belief that the New York grand jury indictment — and three additional pending investigations — are politically motivated and intended to weaken his bid to retake the White House in 2024.
Trump, a former reality-TV star, has been hyping that narrative to his political advantage, raising millions of dollars since the indictment on claims of a “witch hunt.” He has personally assailed the Manhattan district attorney, egged on supporters to protest, and claimed without evidence that the judge presiding over the case “hates me” — something Trump’s own lawyer has said is not true.
Trump is scheduled to return to his Florida home, Mar-a-Lago, Tuesday evening to hold a rally, punctuating his new reality: submitting to the dour demands of the American criminal justice system while projecting an aura of defiance and victimhood at celebratory campaign events.
A conviction would not prevent Trump from running for or winning the presidency in 2024.
Inside the Manhattan courtroom, prosecutors led by New York’s district attorney, Alvin Bragg, are expected to unseal the indictment issued last week by a grand jury. This is when Trump and his defense lawyers will get their first glimpse of the precise allegations against him.
The indictment includes multiple charges of falsifying business records, including at least one felony offense, two people familiar with the matter told The Associated Press last week.
After the arraignment, Trump is expected to be released by authorities because the charges against him don’t require that bail be set.
The investigation is scrutinizing six-figure payments made to porn actor Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal. Both say they had sexual encounters with the married Trump years before he got into politics. Trump denies having sexual liaisons with either woman and has denied any wrongdoing involving payments.
The arraignment will unfold against the backdrop of heavy security in New York, coming more than two years after Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol in a failed bid to halt the congressional certification of President Joe Biden’s win.
Though police said they had no intelligence suggesting any violence was likely, they were on high alert for any potential disruptions.
“While there may be some rabble rousers thinking of coming to our city tomorrow, our message is clear and simple: Control yourselves,” Mayor Eric Adams said at a news conference Monday.
Trump pollster John McLaughlin said the former president would approach the day with “dignity.”
“He will be a gentleman,” McLaughlin said. “He’ll show strength and he’ll show dignity and ... we’ll get through this and win the election.”
The public fascination with the case was evident Monday as national television carried live images of Trump’s motorcade from his Mar-a-Lago club to his red, white and blue Boeing 757. From there, he was flown to New York, where he was expected to spend the night at Trump Tower before turning himself in the following day.
The former president and his aides are embracing the media circus. After initially being caught off guard when news of the indictment broke Thursday evening, Trump and his team are hoping to use the case to his advantage. Still, they asked the judge in a Monday filing to ban photo and video coverage of the arraignment.
Though prosecutors routinely insist that no person is above the law, bringing criminal charges against a former president carries instant logistical complications.
New York’s ability to carry out safe and drama-free courthouse proceedings in a case involving a polarizing ex-president could be an important test case as prosecutors in Atlanta and Washington conduct their own investigations of Trump that could also result in charges. Those investigations concern efforts to undo the 2020 election results as well as the possible mishandling of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago.
Top Republicans, including some of Trump’s potential rivals in next year’s GOP presidential primary, have decried the case against him. President Joe Biden, who has yet to formally announce that he’s seeking reelection next year, and other leading Democrats have largely had little to say about it.
Trump’s former U.N. ambassador, Nikki Haley, was campaigning on Monday near the U.S.-Mexico border as part of her presidential bid and suggested that coverage of the former president’s indictment was distracting from other key issues, like immigration. But even she added, “You’ve got a liberal prosecutor that’s doing political revenge against a former president.”
Prosecutors say their case against Trump has nothing to do with politics.

In the years since Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman catapulted to power, it has been hard to find a controversy in the Middle East that doesn’t somehow involve the 37-year-old heir to the throne. Now he’s pivoting to his next audacious plan: Giving peace a chance.
The moves toward reaching a détente with Iran, reestablishing ties to Syria and ending the kingdom’s yearslong war in Yemen could extricate Prince Mohammed from some of the thorniest regional issues he faces.
Whether it succeeds will have profound impacts on the wider Middle East and on his expansive plans to reshape the kingdom away from oil and further into his image. Failure threatens not only his impending rule over a nation crucial to global energy supplies, but a wider region shaken by years of tensions, inflamed in part by his decisions.
Prince Mohammed’s rise accelerated in 2015 after his father, King Salman, appointed him as deputy crown prince. That year saw Mohammed, also the country’s defense minister at the time, plunge Saudi Arabia into a military campaign in Yemen, a civil war that grew into a regional proxy battle still continuing today. Riyadh supports Yemen’s exiled government against the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels who hold Sanaa, the country’s capital.
The tensions with Iran, at the time still in a nuclear deal with world powers, escalated with Saudi Arabia’s execution of a prominent Shiite cleric in 2016. Protesters stormed Saudi diplomatic posts in Iran, and Riyadh broke off ties to Tehran.
In 2017, Saudi Arabia joined three other Arab nations in boycotting Qatar, which maintains ties to Iran. The same year, the prince made what appeared to be a heavy-handed attempt to break Iranian-backed Hezbollah’s domination of Lebanon’s government by inviting Lebanon’s prime minister to the kingdom and then allegedly forcing him to announce his resignation. The attempt failed and Saudi Arabia’s influence in Lebanon has been diminished ever since.
Prince Mohammed days later launched a purported anti-corruption campaign that saw the Saudi elite locked in the Ritz Carlton until they handed over billions in assets. The slaying of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, believed by the United States and others to be at the prince’s orders, followed in 2018.
But an attack that followed likely changed the prince’s calculations. In September 2019, a barrage of cruise missiles and drones struck at the heart of Saudi Arabia’s oil industry, temporarily halving production.
While the Houthis initially claimed the assault, the West and Saudi Arabia later blamed the attacks on Tehran. Independent experts also linked the weapons to Iran. Though Tehran still denies carrying out the attack, even United Nations investigators said that “the Houthi forces are unlikely to be responsible for the attack.”
Saudi Arabia never retaliated publicly for the attack, nor did the U.S. under President Donald Trump as the longtime security guarantor for the Gulf Arab states. That, as well as America’s later chaotic 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan, led to a reconsideration in the region of how much to rely on U.S. promises.
Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia maintained a close relationship with Russia as part of the OPEC+ group. The organization’s oil production cuts, even as Moscow’s war on Ukraine boosted energy prices, angered President Joe Biden and American lawmakers. China, emerging from the coronavirus pandemic, also wants to secure its supply of Saudi oil.
Both Russia and China offer Saudi Arabia and Prince Mohammed the cachet of being respected by the world’s great powers without the persistent human rights concerns of the West. Prince Mohammed has hosted and spoken by phone with both Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russia’s Vladimir Putin.
The Chinese-mediated deal on the kingdom reestablishing ties with Iran also provides Prince Mohammed with a new opportunity to show the U.S. that others can shape Mideast politics. It also offers a needed lull to allow the prince to instead focus on his planned $500 billion futuristic desert smart city project called Neom in the kingdom’s northwest, and the Mukaab in Riyadh — a 400-meter-high (523-yard) cube-shaped mini-city full of holograms and entertainment venues — to anchor a new downtown in the Saudi capital, likely to cost billions more if completed.
A lull in tensions is desperately sought by Iran as well, particularly in the wake of the Mahsa Amini protests that represent one of the greatest challenges to its theocracy since the chaotic years after the 1979 Islamic Revolution. U.S. sanctions over Tehran’s collapsed nuclear deal as well still choke Iran’s economy.
For Prince Mohammed, the time must have appeared right to make the move. Already, Saudi Arabia led efforts to reestablish ties to Qatar in 2021. Easing tensions with Iran may provide him the avenue to finally fully pull out of the Yemen war.
Still, Prince Mohammed instructing Saudi officials to sit down with Iranian counterparts to reopen embassies represents a dramatic change for a leader who in 2018 said: “I believe the Iranian supreme leader makes Hitler look good.”
Meanwhile, talks are ongoing on restoring ties with Syria, still under Iranian-backed President Bashar Assad after years of civil war. An upcoming Arab League summit being hosted by the kingdom in May could see Syria formally brought back into the fold. Even Lebanon, beset by crises ranging from fiscal to even time keeping, could benefit from a Saudi-Iran rapprochement.
The kingdom will also face a transition in the future. King Salman is already 87. His predecessor, King Abdullah, was the oldest Saudi monarch when he died at the age 90. Prince Mohammed likely will be the youngest ever to take the throne — and could have decades more to make his mark on the kingdom.
What that mark will be depends just as much on him as it does on whether he can cool the tensions he helped kindle.

Former US President Donald Trump faces the most urgent legal challenge of his life this week in New York, where he’s set to be arraigned Tuesday on charges arising from hush money payments during his 2016 campaign.
But as much of the attention will be on the courthouse in lower Manhattan, investigations from Atlanta to Washington will press forward, underscoring the broad range of peril he confronts as he seeks to reclaim the presidency.
The vulnerability Trump faces in Washington alone has become clear over the past month, as judges in a succession of sealed rulings have turned aside the Trump team’s efforts to block grand jury testimony — including from his own lawyer and his former vice president — from witnesses who were, or still are, close to him and who could conceivably offer direct insight into key events.
The rulings directing advisers and aides to testify don’t suggest that the Justice Department is close to bringing criminal charges, nor do they guarantee that prosecutors can secure testimony valuable to a potential prosecution. But they’re nonetheless a key, closed-door win for the government as it investigates whether classified documents were criminally mishandled at Trump’s Florida home and the possible obstruction of that probe, as well as efforts by Trump and his allies to undo the results of the 2020 presidential election.
“I do think when you’re talking about an attempted insurrection and the kinds of issues that we’re talking about there, there’s going to be a lot of arguments on DOJ’s side” to get the testimony, said Randall Eliason, a former federal prosecutor and a George Washington University law professor.
Meanwhile, the district attorney in Atlanta is continuing to investigate attempts by Trump and his allies to undo his election loss in Georgia. A special grand jury in February said it believed “one or more witnesses” committed perjury and urged local prosecutors to bring charges.
The former president never testified before the special grand jury, meaning he is not among those who could have perjured themselves. But the report doesn’t foreclose the possibility of other charges, and the case still poses particular challenges for Trump, in part because his actions in Georgia were so public.
Overall, the number of sealed disputes over the scope of grand jury testimony is unusual but perhaps befitting for hugely consequential probes like one concerning a former president. It also stands in contrast to the last special counsel investigation involving Trump, when he was president and when Robert Mueller and his team of prosecutors sought to determine whether Trump’s 2016 campaign had colluded with Russia to tip the election.
In that probe, a lawyer inside the White House, Ty Cobb, facilitated voluntary interviews of White House staff — without subpoenas — in hopes that cooperation would hasten the investigation toward conclusion.
“If I could figure out a way to cooperate and still preserve executive privilege, it would speed things up, which in my judgment ... was imperative to the president and to the country,” Cobb said in a recent interview. “We were able to accelerate getting them all of the information.”
Trump in that investigation was protected by the power of his office and by Justice Department legal opinions that say a sitting president cannot be indicted. No longer president, Trump has lost that shield, raising the stakes of his criminal exposure. And as prosecutors have sought to question people close to him — whether to better understand Trump’s state of mind and possible defenses, or to gather potentially damaging testimony — Trump’s lawyers have repeatedly objected, often in vain.
Perhaps the most vivid example came last month when the then-chief judge of the D.C. federal court ordered that Trump’s lawyer, M. Evan Corcoran, had to give more grand jury testimony in the Mar-a-Lago investigation. He had invoked attorney-client privilege in an earlier appearance before the grand jury in declining to answer more questions, but prosecutors pressed for more testimony.
They cited what’s known as the crime-fraud exception to attorney client privilege, which allows prosecutors to compel testimony from a lawyer if they can convince a judge that a client was using legal services in furtherance of a crime. U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell ruled that Corcoran had to return before the grand jury, and he was in court a week later.
Another instance came last week when a different federal judge, James Boasberg, ruled that former Vice President Mike Pence had to give some testimony in a Justice Department special counsel probe into efforts to undo the election.
The decision rejected the Trump team’s arguments of executive privilege, though Boasberg did give Pence a victory by accepting his lawyers’ arguments that, for constitutional reasons, he could not be questioned about his actions on Jan. 6, 2021, when a mob of Trump’s supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol as Republican Pence was presiding over a joint session of Congress to certify Democrat Joe Biden’s victory.
A Trump spokesman did not respond to a request for comment on this story but responded to the ruling in the Pence matter in a statement saying that the Justice Department “is continuously stepping far outside the standard norms in attempting to destroy the long accepted, long held, Constitutionally based standards of attorney-client privilege and executive privilege.”
Other former Trump aides, including Stephen Miller and former national security adviser Robert O’Brien, have also recently been ordered by a judge to offer testimony despite Trump team objections of executive privilege.
The ability of Justice Department prosecutors in multiple instances to convince judges that there’s a basis to secure the testimony is significant to the extent that it shows that “there’s a there there” with respect to the investigations, Eliason said.
But he cautioned from reading too much into it, given that the threshold for prevailing in a fight over executive privilege or attorney-client is lower than the burden needed to win a criminal case at trial.
“It’s a far cry from being able to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt in a contested trial,”

Europe’s biggest armed conflict since World War II is poised to enter a new phase in the coming weeks.
With no suggestion of a negotiated end to the 13 months of fighting between Russia and Ukraine, the Ukrainian defense minister said last week that a spring counteroffensive could begin as soon as April.
Kyiv faces a key tactical question: How can the Ukrainian military dislodge Kremlin forces from land they are occupying? Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is working hard to keep his troops, and the general public, motivated for a long fight.
Here’s a look at how the fighting has evolved and how the spring campaign might unfold:
HOW DID THE WAR GET HERE?
Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 2022, but its attacks fell short of some main targets and lost momentum by July. Ukrainian counteroffensives took back large areas from August through November.
Then the fighting got bogged down in attritional warfare during the bitter winter and into the muddy, early spring thaw.
Now, Kyiv can take advantage of improved weather to seize the battlefield initiative with new batches of Western weapons, including scores of tanks, and fresh troops trained in the West.
But Russian forces are dug in deep, lying in wait behind minefields and along kilometers (miles) of trenches.
HOW HAS RUSSIA FARED SO FAR?
The war has exposed embarrassing shortcomings in the Kremlin’s military prowess.
The battlefield setbacks include Russia’s failure to reach Kyiv in the early days of the invasion, its inability to hold some areas and its failure to take the devastated eastern city of Bakhmut despite seven months of fighting. Attempts to break the Ukrainian will to fight, such as relentlessly striking the country’s power grid, have failed too.
Moscow’s intelligence services badly misjudged Ukraine’s resolve and the West’s response. The invasion also depleted Russian military resources, triggering difficulties with ammunition supplies, morale and troop numbers.
Russian President Vladimir Putin, apparently concerned that the war could erode public support for his government, has avoided an all-out push for victory through a mandatory mass mobilization.
“The Russians have no end of problems,” said James Nixey, director of the Russia and Eurasia program at Chatham House, a think tank in London.
Realizing he cannot win the war any time soon, Putin aims to hunker down and drag out the fighting in the hope that Western support for Kyiv eventually frays, Nixey said.
Russia’s strategy is designed around “getting the West to crumble,” he said.
WHAT’S NEXT FOR THE UKRAINIANS?
The Ukrainian military starts the season with an influx of powerful weapons.
Germany said this week that it had delivered the 18 Leopard 2 tanks it promised to Ukraine. Poland, Canada and Norway have also handed over their pledged Leopard tanks. British Challenger tanks have arrived too.
Ukraine’s defense minister, Oleksii Reznikov, has said he’s hopeful Western partners will supply at least two battalions of the German-made Leopard 2s by April. He also expects six or seven battalions of Leopard 1 tanks, with ammunition, from a coalition of countries.
Also pledged are U.S. Abrams tanks and French light tanks, along with Ukraine soldiers recently trained in their use.
The Western help has been vital in strengthening Ukraine’s dogged resistance and shaping the course of the war. Zelenskyy recognizes that without U.S. help, his country has no chance to prevail.
The new supplies, including howitzers, anti-tank weapons and 1 million rounds of artillery ammunition, will add more muscle to the Ukraine military and give it a bigger punch.
“Sheer numbers of tanks can drive a deeper wedge into Russian holding positions,” Nixey said.
In their counteroffensive, Ukrainian forces will look to break through the land corridor between Russia and the annexed Crimean peninsula, moving from Zaporizhzhia toward Melitopol and the Azov Sea, according to Ukrainian military analyst Oleh Zhdanov.
If successful, the Ukrainians “will split the Russian troops into two halves and cut off supply lines to the units that are located further to the west, in the direction of Crimea,” Zhdanov said.
WHAT MIGHT THE END GAME BE?
The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, reckons that Ukraine will need to launch a series of counteroffensives, not just one, to get the upper hand.
The operations would have “the twin aims of persuading Putin to accept a negotiated compromise or of creating military realities sufficiently favorable to Ukraine that Kyiv and its Western allies can then effectively freeze the conflict on their own regardless of Putin’s decisions,” the institute said in an assessment published this week.
Nixey has no doubt that each side will keep “tearing chunks out of each other” over the coming months in the hope of gaining an advantage at the negotiating table.
A make-or-break period may lie ahead: If Kyiv fails to make progress on the battlefield with its Western-supplied weapons, allies may become reluctant to send it more of the expensive hardware.
The stakes are high: Defeat for Ukraine would “have global ramifications, and there will be no such thing as European security as we (currently) understand it,” Nixey said.

Storms that dropped possibly dozens of tornadoes killed at least 21 people in small towns and big cities across the South and Midwest, tearing a path through the Arkansas capital, collapsing the roof of a packed concert venue in Illinois, and stunning people throughout the region Saturday with the damage’s scope.
Confirmed or suspected tornadoes in at least eight states destroyed homes and businesses, splintered trees and laid waste to neighborhoods across a broad swath of the country. The dead included at least seven in one Tennessee county, four in the small town of Wynne, Arkansas, three in Sullivan, Indiana, and four in Illinois.
Other deaths from the storms that hit Friday night into Saturday were reported in Alabama and Mississippi, along with one near Little Rock, Arkansas, where city officials said more than 2,600 buildings were in a tornado’s path.
Residents of Wynne, Tennessee, a community of about 8,000 people 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of Memphis, woke Saturday to find the high school’s roof shredded and its windows blown out. Huge trees lay on the ground, their stumps reduced to nubs. Broken walls, windows and roofs pocked homes and businesses.
Debris lay scattered inside the shells of homes and on lawns: clothing, insulation, toys, splintered furniture, a pickup truck with its windows shattered.
Ashley Macmillan said she, her husband and their children huddled with their dogs in a small bathroom as a tornado passed, “praying and saying goodbye to each other, because we thought we were dead.” A falling tree seriously damaged their home, but they were unhurt.
“We could feel the house shaking, we could hear loud noises, dishes rattling. And then it just got calm,” she said.
Recovery was already underway, with workers using chainsaws and bulldozers to clear the area and utility crews restoring power.
At least seven people died in Tennessee’s McNairy County, east of Memphis, said David Leckner, the mayor of Adamsville. The number could still climb as crews continued to search through the wreckage.
“The majority of the damage has been done to homes and residential areas,” Leckner said.
Gov. Bill Lee drove to the county Saturday to tour the destruction and comfort residents. He said the storm capped the “worst” week of his time as governor, coming days after a school shooting in Nashville that killed six people including a family friend whose funeral he and his wife, Maria, attended earlier in the day.
“It’s terrible what has happened in this community, this county, this state,” Lee said. “But it looks like your community has done what Tennessean communities do, and that is rally and respond.”
Jeffrey Day said he called his daughter after seeing on the news that their community of Adamsville was being hit. Huddled in a closet with her two-year-old son as the storm passed over, she answered the phone screaming.
“She kept asking me, ‘What do I do, daddy?’” Day said, tearing up. “I didn’t know what to say.”
After the storm passed, his daughter crawled out of her destroyed home and over barbed wire and drove to nearby family. On Saturday evening, baby clothes were still strewn about the site.
Tennessee officials warned that the same weather conditions from Friday night are expected to return Tuesday.
In Belvidere, Illinois, part of the roof of the Apollo Theatre collapsed as about 260 people were attending a heavy metal concert. A 50-year-old man was pulled from the rubble.
“I sat with him and I held his hand and I was (telling him), ‘It’s going to be OK.’ I didn’t really know much else what to do,” concertgoer Gabrielle Lewellyn told WTVO-TV.
The man was dead by the time emergency workers arrived. Officials said 40 others were hurt, including two with life-threatening injuries.
On Saturday, crews were cleaning up around the Apollo, with forklifts pulling away loose bricks. Business owners picked up glass shards and covered shattered windows.
In Crawford County, Illinois, three people were killed and eight injured when a tornado hit around New Hebron, Bill Burke, the county board chair, said.
Sheriff Bill Rutan said 60 to 100 families were displaced.
“We’ve had emergency crews digging people out of their basements because the house is collapsed on top of them, but luckily they had that safe space to go to,” Rutan said at a news conference.
That tornado was not far from where three people died in Indiana’s Sullivan County, about 95 miles (150 kilometers) southwest of Indianapolis.
Sullivan Mayor Clint Lamb said at a news conference that an area south of the county seat of about 4,000 “is essentially unrecognizable right now” and that several people were rescued overnight. There were reports of as many as 12 people injured, he said.
“I’m really, really shocked there isn’t more as far as human issues,” he said, adding that recovery “is going to be a very long process.”
In the Little Rock area, at least one person was killed and more than 50 were hurt, some critically.
The National Weather Service said that tornado was a high-end EF3 twister with wind speeds up to 165 mph (265 kph) and a path as long as 25 miles (40 kilometers).
Masoud Shahed-Ghaznavi was lunching at home when it roared through his neighborhood, causing him to hide in the laundry room as sheetrock fell and windows shattered. When he emerged, the house was mostly rubble.
“Everything around me is sky,” Shahed-Ghaznavi recalled Saturday. He barely slept Friday night.
“When I closed my eyes, I couldn’t sleep, imagined I was here,” he said Saturday outside his home.
Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders declared a state of emergency and activated the National Guard.
Another suspected tornado killed a woman in northern Alabama’s Madison County, officials said, and in northern Mississippi’s Pontotoc County, one death and four injuries were confirmed.
Tornadoes also caused damage in eastern Iowa and broke windows northeast of Peoria, Illinois.
The storms struck just hours after President Joe Biden visited Rolling Fork, Mississippi, where tornadoes last week destroyed parts of town.
It could take days to determine the exact number of tornadoes from the latest event, said Bill Bunting, chief of forecast operations at the Storm Prediction Center. There were also hundreds of reports of large hail and damaging winds, he said.
“That’s a quite active day,” he said. “But that’s not unprecedented.”
More than 530,000 homes and businesses were without power as of midday Saturday, over 200,000 of them in Ohio, according to PowerOutage.us.
The sprawling storm system also brought wildfires to the southern Plains, with authorities in Oklahoma reporting nearly 100 of them Friday. At least 32 people were said to be injured, and more than 40 homes destroyed.
The storms also caused blizzard conditions in the Upper Midwest.
A threat of tornadoes and hail remained for the Northeast including in parts of Pennsylvania and New York.

Thirty-five bodies have been found inside a well at a Hindu temple in central India after dozens of people fell into the muddy water when the well’s cover collapsed, officials said Friday.
Video of Thursday’s collapse at the temple complex in Indore in Madhya Pradesh state showed chaos afterward, with people rushing toward the exits. An excavator pulled down a wall of the decades-old temple to help people flee.
Nearly 140 rescuers, including army personnel, used ropes and ladders to pull the bodies from the well after pumping out the water. A narrow path and debris in the well made the task difficult.
Witnesses said a large crowd of devotees had thronged the temple to perform a fire ritual and celebrate the festival for the deity Rama.
Dozens of people fell into the water when the structure over the well collapsed and were covered by falling debris, police Commissioner Makrand Deoskar said.
Kantibhai Patel, president of a residents’ association, told reporters that authorities were slow to react and the first ambulance reached the spot an hour after the alert.
The structure apparently caved in because it could not handle the weight of the large crowd, said the state’s top elected official, Shivraj Singh Chauhan. He ordered an investigation.
“We have so far recovered 35 bodies and the rescue operation is continuing,” said Ilayaraja T., a district administrator. The effort was continuing Friday.
A team of army rescuers joined the operation on Thursday night. The Times of India newspaper reported the rescue work was expedited after underwater cameras showed bodies floating in the muddy waters of the well.
Chauhan said 33 of the bodies had been identified and one person was unaccounted for. Sixteen of the people who were injured remained hospitalized Friday.
Temple authorities had stopped using the well years ago and covered the mouth with iron grills and tiles.
Municipal authorities in January ordered temple owners to remove the covering of the well because it was an unsafe and unauthorized structure, but temple authorities ignored the warning, the newspaper said.
Building collapses are common in India because of poor construction and a failure to observe regulations.
In October, a century-old cable suspension bridge collapsed into a river in the western state of Gujarat, sending hundreds of people plunging into the water and killing at least 132 in one of the worst accidents in the country in the past decade.

Donald Trump has been indicted by a Manhattan grand jury, a historic reckoning after years of investigations into his personal, political and business dealings and an abrupt jolt to his bid to retake the White House.
The exact nature of the charges was unclear Friday because the indictment remained under seal, but they stem from payments made during the 2016 presidential campaign to silence claims of an extramarital sexual encounter. Prosecutors said they were working to coordinate Trump’s surrender, which could happen early next week. They did not say whether they intended to seek prison time in the event of a conviction, a development that wouldn’t prevent Trump from seeking and assuming the presidency.
The indictment, the first against a former U.S. president, injects a local district attorney’s office into the heart of a national presidential race and ushers in criminal proceedings in a city that the ex-president for decades called home. Arriving at a time of deep political divisions, the charges are likely to reinforce rather than reshape dueling perspectives of those who see accountability as long overdue and those who, like Trump, feel the Republican is being targeted for political purposes by a Democratic prosecutor.
Trump, who has denied any wrongdoing and has repeatedly assailed the investigation, called the indictment “political persecution” and predicted it would damage Democrats in 2024. In a statement confirming the charges, defense lawyers Susan Necheles and Joseph Tacopina said Trump “did not commit any crime. We will vigorously fight this political prosecution in court.”
A spokesman for the Manhattan district attorney’s office confirmed the indictment and said prosecutors had reached out to Trump’s defense team to coordinate a surrender. Tacopina said Trump is “likely” to turn himself in on Tuesday.
Trump was asked to surrender Friday but his lawyers said the Secret Service needed additional time as they made security preparations, two people familiar with the matter told The Associated Press. The people spoke on condition of anonymity because they couldn’t publicly discuss security details.
District Attorney Alvin Bragg left his office Thursday evening without commenting.
The case centers on well-chronicled allegations from a period in 2016 when Trump’s celebrity past collided with his political ambitions. Prosecutors for months scrutinized money paid to porn actor Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal, whom he feared would go public with claims that they had extramarital sexual encounters with him.
The timing of the indictment appeared to come as a surprise to Trump campaign officials following news reports that criminal charges were likely weeks away. The former president was at Mar-a-Lago, his Florida estate, on Thursday and filmed an interview with a conservative commentator earlier in the day.
For a man whose presidency was defined by one obliterated norm after another, the indictment sets up yet another never-before-seen spectacle — a former president having his fingerprints and mug shot taken, and then facing arraignment. For security reasons, his booking is expected to be carefully choreographed to avoid crowds inside or outside the courthouse.
The prosecution also means that Trump will have to simultaneously fight for his freedom and political future, while also fending off potentially more perilous legal threats, including investigations into attempts by him and his allies to undo the 2020 presidential election as well as into the hoarding of hundreds of classified documents.
In fact, New York was until recently seen as an unlikely contender to be the first place to prosecute Trump, who continues to face long-running investigations in Atlanta and Washington that could also result in charges. Unlike those inquiries, the Manhattan case concerns allegations against Trump that occurred before he became president and are unrelated to his much-publicized efforts to overturn the election.
The indictment comes as Trump seeks to reassert control of the Republican Party and stave off a slew of one-time allies who may threaten his bid for the presidential nomination. An expected leading rival in the race, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, called the indictment “un-American” in a statement Thursday night that pointedly did not mention Trump’s name.
In bringing the charges, Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney, is embracing an unusual case that was investigated by two previous sets of prosecutors, both of which declined to take the politically explosive step of seeking Trump’s indictment. The case may also turn in part on the testimony of a key witness, Trump’s former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen, who pleaded guilty to federal charges arising from the hush money payments, including making false statements.
The probe’s fate seemed uncertain until word got out in early March that Bragg had invited Trump to testify before a grand jury, a signal that prosecutors were close to bringing charges.
Trump’s attorneys declined the invitation, but a lawyer closely allied with the former president briefly testified in an effort to undercut Cohen’s credibility.
Trump himself raised anticipation that he would be indicted soon, issuing a statement earlier this month in which he predicted an imminent arrest and called for protests. He did not repeat that call in a fresh statement Thursday, but the New York Police Department told its 36,000 officers to be fully mobilized and ready to respond to any potential protests or unrest.
Late in the 2016 presidential campaign, Cohen paid Daniels $130,000 to keep her silent about what she says was a sexual encounter with Trump a decade earlier after they met at a celebrity golf tournament.
Cohen was then reimbursed by Trump’s company, the Trump Organization, which also rewarded the lawyer with bonuses and extra payments logged internally as legal expenses. Over several months, Cohen said, the company paid him $420,000.
Earlier in 2016, Cohen also arranged for the publisher of the supermarket tabloid the National Enquirer to pay McDougal $150,000 to squelch her story of a Trump affair in a journalistically dubious practice known as “catch-and-kill.”
The payments to the women were intended to buy secrecy, but they backfired almost immediately as details of the arrangements leaked to the news media.
Federal prosecutors in New York ultimately charged Cohen in 2018 with violating federal campaign finance laws, arguing that the payments amounted to impermissible help to Trump’s presidential campaign. Cohen pleaded guilty to those charges and unrelated tax evasion counts and served time in federal prison.
Trump was implicated in court filings as having knowledge of the arrangements — obliquely referred to in charging documents as “Individual 1” — but U.S. prosecutors at the time balked at bringing charges against him. The Justice Department has a longtime policy against indicting a sitting president in federal court.
Bragg’s predecessor as district attorney, Cyrus Vance Jr., then took up the investigation in 2019. While that probe initially focused on the hush money payments, Vance’s prosecutors moved on to other matters, including an examination of Trump’s business dealings and tax strategies.
Vance ultimately charged the Trump Organization and its chief financial officer with tax fraud related to fringe benefits paid to some of the company’s top executives.
The hush money matter became known around the D.A.’s office as the “zombie case,” with prosecutors revisiting it periodically but never opting to bring charges.
Bragg saw it differently. After the Trump Organization was convicted on the tax fraud charges in December, he brought fresh eyes to the well-worn case, hiring longtime white-collar prosecutor Matthew Colangelo to oversee the probe and convening a new grand jury.
Cohen became a key witness, meeting with prosecutors nearly two-dozen times, turning over emails, recordings and other evidence and testifying before the grand jury.
Trump has long decried the Manhattan investigation as “the greatest witch hunt in history.” He has also lashed out at Bragg, calling the prosecutor, who is Black, racist against white people.
The criminal charges in New York are the latest salvo in a profound schism between Trump and his hometown — a reckoning for a one-time favorite son who grew rich and famous building skyscrapers, hobnobbing with celebrities and gracing the pages of the city’s gossip press.
Trump, who famously riffed in 2016 that he “could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody” and “wouldn’t lose voters,” now faces a threat to his liberty in a borough where more than 75% of voters — many of them potential jurors — went against him in the last election.

Donald Trump has been indicted by a Manhattan grand jury, prosecutors and defense lawyers said Thursday, making him the first former U.S. president to face a criminal charge and jolting his bid to retake the White House next year.
The charges remained under seal late Thursday, but the investigation centered on payments made during the 2016 presidential campaign to silence claims of an extramarital sexual encounter. Prosecutors said they were working to coordinate Trump’s surrender, which could happen early next week. They did not say whether they intended to seek prison time in the event of a conviction, a development that wouldn’t prevent Trump from seeking or winning the presidency.
The indictment, an extraordinary development after years of investigations into Trump’s business, political and personal dealings, injects a local district attorney’s office into the heart of a national presidential race and ushers in criminal proceedings in a city that the ex-president for decades called home. Arriving at a time of deep political divisions, the charges are likely to reinforce rather than reshape dueling perspectives of those who see accountability as long overdue and those who, like Trump, feel the Republican is being targeted for political purposes by a Democratic prosecutor.

A ferry carrying about 250 passengers and crew caught fire in the southern Philippines and 31 people drowned or died in the blaze and were discovered later, a provincial governor said Thursday.
Many of those rescued had jumped off the MV Lady Mary Joy 3 in panic at the height of the fire and were plucked from the sea by the coast guard, navy, another ferry and local fishermen, said Gov. Jim Hataman of the southern island province of Basilan. The search and rescue effort was continuing Thursday for at least seven missing passengers.
The burned ferry was towed to Basilan’s shoreline, where coast guard personnel and other authorities later discovered 18 more bodies in a budget section of the passenger cabin, Hataman said, adding the search of the vessel was continuing.
“These victims perished onboard due to the fire,” Hataman said. The governor said an investigation was underway and the discovery suggested there were additional travelers not listed on the vessel’s manifest.
The ferry was enroute to Jolo town in Sulu province from the southern port city of Zamboanga when it caught fire midway off Basilan close to midnight, he said.
At least 23 passengers were injured and brought to hospitals.
“Some of the passengers were roused from sleep due to the commotion caused by the fire. Some jumped off the ship,” Hataman told The Associated Press by telephone.
Sea accidents are common in the Philippine archipelago because of frequent storms, badly maintained boats, overcrowding and spotty enforcement of safety regulations, especially in remote provinces.
In December 1987, the ferry Dona Paz sank after colliding with a fuel tanker, killing more than 4,300 people in the world’s worst peacetime maritime disaster.

Are tech companies moving too fast in rolling out powerful artificial intelligence technology that could one day outsmart humans?
That’s the conclusion of a group of prominent computer scientists and other tech industry notables such as Elon Musk and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak who are calling for a 6-month pause to consider the risks.
Their petition published Wednesday is a response to San Francisco startup OpenAI’s recent release of GPT-4, a more advanced successor to its widely-used AI chatbot ChatGPT that helped spark a race among tech giants Microsoft and Google to unveil similar applications.
WHAT DO THEY SAY?
The letter warns that AI systems with “human-competitive intelligence can pose profound risks to society and humanity” — from flooding the internet with disinformation and automating away jobs to more catastrophic future risks out of the realms of science fiction.
It says “recent months have seen AI labs locked in an out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no one – not even their creators – can understand, predict, or reliably control.”
“We call on all AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4,” the letter says. “This pause should be public and verifiable, and include all key actors. If such a pause cannot be enacted quickly, governments should step in and institute a moratorium.”
A number of governments are already working to regulate high-risk AI tools. The United Kingdom released a paper Wednesday outlining its approach, which it said “will avoid heavy-handed legislation which could stifle innovation.” Lawmakers in the 27-nation European Union have been negotiating passage of sweeping AI rules.
WHO SIGNED IT?
The petition was organized by the nonprofit Future of Life Institute, which says confirmed signatories include the Turing Award-winning AI pioneer Yoshua Bengio and other leading AI researchers such as Stuart Russell and Gary Marcus. Others who joined include Wozniak, former U.S. presidential candidate Andrew Yang and Rachel Bronson, president of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, a science-oriented advocacy group known for its warnings against humanity-ending nuclear war.
Musk, who runs Tesla, Twitter and SpaceX and was an OpenAI co-founder and early investor, has long expressed concerns about AI’s existential risks. A more surprising inclusion is Emad Mostaque, CEO of Stability AI, maker of the AI image generator Stable Diffusion that partners with Amazon and competes with OpenAI’s similar generator known as DALL-E.
WHAT’S THE RESPONSE?
OpenAI, Microsoft and Google didn’t respond to requests for comment Wednesday, but the letter already has plenty of skeptics.
“A pause is a good idea, but the letter is vague and doesn’t take the regulatory problems seriously,” says James Grimmelmann, a Cornell University professor of digital and information law. “It is also deeply hypocritical for Elon Musk to sign on given how hard Tesla has fought against accountability for the defective AI in its self-driving cars.”
IS THIS AI HYSTERIA?
While the letter raises the specter of nefarious AI far more intelligent than what actually exists, it’s not “superhuman” AI that some who signed on are worried about. While impressive, a tool such as ChatGPT is simply a text generator that makes predictions about what words would answer the prompt it was given based on what it’s learned from ingesting huge troves of written works.
Gary Marcus, a New York University professor emeritus who signed the letter, said in a blog post that he disagrees with others who are worried about the near-term prospect of intelligent machines so smart they can self-improve themselves beyond humanity’s control. What he’s more worried about is “mediocre AI” that’s widely deployed, including by criminals or terrorists to trick people or spread dangerous misinformation.
“Current technology already poses enormous risks that we are ill-prepared for,” Marcus wrote. “With future technology, things could well get worse.”

A ferry carrying about 250 passengers and crew caught fire between Philippine islands and at least 12 people were killed with seven still missing, a provincial governor said Thursday.
Many of those rescued had jumped off the ferry in panic at the height of the fire and were plucked from the sea by the coast guard, navy, another ferry and local fishermen, said Gov. Jim Hataman of the southern island province of Basilan. The search and rescue effort was continuing Thursday.
The governor said most of those onboard the MV Lady Mary Joy 3 were rescued overnight but authorities were double-checking the numbers from different rescue teams, suggesting the figures could change.
The ferry was enroute to Jolo town in Sulu province from the southern port city of Zamboanga when it caught fire midway off Basilan close to midnight, he said.
The dead included at least three children, who apparently were separated from their parents, and at least 23 passengers were injured and brought to hospitals, he said.
“Some of the passengers were roused from sleep due to the commotion caused by the fire. Some jumped off the ship,” Hataman told The Associated Press by telephone.
Most of those who died drowned and were recovered at sea, officials said.

Janata Samajwadi Party (JSP) Chairman Upendra Yadav, who lost to Janamat Party Chairman CK Raut in the House of Representatives (HoR) constituency of Saptari-2 in November 2022, may again have to suffer at the hands of Raut.
This by-election in Bara-2 will be a battle between the waning pre-eminent force in Madhes, JSP, and the rising force, Janamat Party, that hopes to one day overtake JSP as the strongest party in the plains.
Raut recognizing that his party will have to directly compete with JSP if it wishes to become a major force in Madhes ushered Shiv Chandra Kushwaha into Janamat Party from CPN (Maoist Center) to defeat Yadav in the by-election in Bara-2.
Many say JSP Chairman Yadav made his confidant Ram Sahay Prasad Yadav, who was elected from Bara-2, vice-president to contest the by-election from that constituency with a big population of Yadavs where JSP has very strong organization.
Setopati reached all the wards in the constituency, which includes three municipalities and two rural municipalities, and talked with 560 voters about the upcoming by-election, their preferred parties/candidates, the reasons for their preference, and the most important issues for them, among other things.
The constituency includes the whole of Mahagadhimai and Pachrauta municipalities; Suvarna, Devtal and Karaiyamai rural municipalities; and Ward Number 8 of Kolhabi Municipality.
Just 3,000-4,000 of around 125,000 voters in the constituency are of hill origin while the Yadavs constitute the biggest community here. The Pachpaunia community, which also includes Janamat Party candidate Kushwaha, is the second biggest community while the constituency also includes Madhesi Dalits, Tharus and Muslims.

A whopping 199 (35.5%) of the 560 voters Setopati talked to said that they would vote for Kushwaha—who had secured 13,823 votes contesting as the common coalition candidate on a Maoist ticket and lost to Ram Sahay Prasad Yadav by just 355 votes in the November election—while 161 (28.7) said that they would vote for Upendra Yadav.
Sixty-two (11%) of them said that they would vote for Ramesh Kharel of Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) while 59 (10.5%) pledged to vote for Purushottam Paudel of CPN-UML meaning the two would have a close fight for the third position.
Thirty-one (5.5%) of them said that they would vote for Arun Gyawali of Janata Party led by Prabhu Sah while 48 (8.5%) of the voters said that they had yet to decide who to vote for.
Janamat Party seems set to attract most votes from JSP in the constituency.
Fifty-eight of the 199 who pledged to vote for Kushwaha said that they had voted for JSP in November, 27 said that they had voted for CPN (Maoist Center), 18 for independent candidates, and 11 had not voted in November due to different reasons. Similarly, 16 pledged to vote for Janamat Party despite being affiliated to Nepali Congress (NC).
Ninety-four of the 161 who pledged to vote for Upendra Yadav said that they had voted for JSP also in November and 17 said that they had voted for independent candidates. Twenty-eight said that they supported NC and would vote for Yadav as he was the common coalition candidate, and nine said that they supported Maoist Center and would vote for Yadav for the same reason. Four said that they would vote for Yadav despite supporting UML while six said that they had not voted in November due to different reasons.
JSP also seems to be leaking votes to RSP that has fielded Ramesh Kharel, who had resigned from the post of DIG of Nepal Police and made a name for himself serving as SP in Parsa district in the past. Kharel himself has been campaigning as SP Kharel to capitalize on that goodwill while some voters also said they would vote for him due to RSP President Rabi Lamichhane.
Sixteen of the 62 who pledged to vote for RSP’s Kharel said that they had voted for JSP in November while six are first-time voters. Nine said they would vote for Kharel despite being NC supporters while three UML supporters also pledged to vote for him.
All the 59 voters who pledged to vote for UML candidate Paudel said they would vote for him as they support UML. This shows that it will be hard for UML, which had supported Ram Sahay Prasad Yadav in the constituency in November, to attract voters from other parties even as it looks set to leak votes to Janamat Party, RSP and even JSP.
This does not mean Upendra Yadav will definitely lose or Kushwaha will be elected as voting takes place more than a week later and voters may swing during the intervening period. But the fact that Yadav looks behind in the race in Bara-2 that remains a JSP stronghold to the party with no organization in the constituency should be a matter of grave concern for Yadav.
JSP’s Ram Sahay Prasad Yadav had not just defeated common coalition candidate Kushwaha, who was supported by NC, but JSP was also the largest party in the constituency on the basis of Proportional Representation (PR) electoral system votes securing 13,242 votes. NC was second with 11,179, followed by UML 9,193, Janamat Party 8,846, Loktantrik Samajwadi Party (LSP) 4,225 and Maoist Center 3,256.
Upendra Yadav also has the support of NC, LSP and Maoist Center as the common candidate of the ruling coalition which together secured 31,902 PR votes in November. He also has the support of Ram Kishore Yadav, who secured 11,043 votes contesting as an independent candidate after quitting JSP in Bara-2, and Rabindra Prasad Yadav, who secured 10,750 votes contesting as a rebel NC candidate.
But Upendra Yadav seems to be trailing Kushwaha despite all that. The main reason for that is that Upendra Yadav is not contesting Kushwaha but Raut, who had defeated him in Saptari, in what appears to be a rematch of that November contest.
Many of the voters Setopati talked to said that Raut and Upendra Yadav are set for a close fight despite Raut not contesting the election. Raut’s magic seems to work the most on youths, women, impoverished people and Dalits.
Aware that defeating Upendra Yadav again in Bara-2 will establish him as the most prominent leader in Madhes, Raut has been staying in Bara in recent times. He has visited all the wards in the constituency, had tea with the voters and talked with them sharing their woes and happiness.
Upendra Yadav has also been based in the constituency but the contrast between him and Raut cannot be starker. Yadav visits with a motorcade and communicating directly with the voters has never been the forte of Yadav, who can neither talk with his eyes or laugh with gay abandon. Many voters complain that he does not listen to their grievances.
Yadav also suffers from the disadvantage of trying to again become HoR member through the backdoor just five months after that resounding defeat in Saptari by engineering the election of his confidant Ram Sahay Prasad Yadav as the country’s vice-president. Many point that he should have exercised patience and waited for five years.
He has always faced the accusation of continuously changing his constituency.
Yadav—who had lost to NC’s Girija Prasad Koirala in Sunsari-5 on a UML ticket in the first parliamentary election after restoration of democracy in 1990 and later joined the Maoist party—rose as the messiah of Madhes following the Madhes Movement triggered by him torching the Interim Constitution at the Maitighar Mandala just a day after it was promulgated on January 15, 2007, as founder of a political advocacy movement named Madhesi Janadhikar Forum.
The next Madhes Movement forced Koirala to sign an agreement accepting federalism. Yadav turned his organization into a political party and emerged as the fourth largest party after Maoists, NC and UML following the First Constituent Assembly (CA) Election in 2008. He was elected to the First Constituent Assembly (CA) Election in 2008 from both Morang and Sunsari districts.
He lost from Morang and won in Sunsari in the Second CA Election in 2013. He contested from Saptari-2, which includes Mahadeva Rural Municipality where he was born, in 2017 in search of a safe seat. But he lost to Raut even in that safe constituency in the recent election.
He has now taken his caravan to Bara-2 and suffers from the same malaise that took him down in Saptari. Many voters complain that he has not done anything for the people of Madhes despite continuously becoming lawmaker and minister in the past 15 years and used politics as a means to get into the government.
The fact that Raut roped in Kushwaha from Maoist Center to defeat Upendra Yadav also seems to be working against Yadav with the Janamat Party candidate looking set to add a few votes on his own on top of all those he looks set to amass owing to the charisma and popularity of Raut.
Upendra Yadav also looks set to struggle to attract all the votes from the second largest party in the constituency, NC, despite the grand old party officially supporting him. He will have to attract as many NC votes as he can if he were to register a narrow win over Kushwaha.

JSP also seems to be leaking votes to RSP that has fielded Ramesh Kharel, who had resigned from the post of DIG of Nepal Police and made a name for himself serving as SP in Parsa district in the past. Kharel himself has been campaigning as SP Kharel to capitalize on that goodwill while some voters also said they would vote for him due to RSP President Rabi Lamichhane.
Sixteen of the 62 who pledged to vote for RSP’s Kharel said that they had voted for JSP in November while six are first-time voters. Nine said they would vote for Kharel despite being NC supporters while three UML supporters also pledged to vote for him.
All the 59 voters who pledged to vote for UML candidate Paudel said they would vote for him as they support UML. This shows that it will be hard for UML, which had supported Ram Sahay Prasad Yadav in the constituency in November, to attract voters from other parties even as it looks set to leak votes to Janamat Party, RSP and even JSP.
This does not mean Upendra Yadav will definitely lose or Kushwaha will be elected as voting takes place more than a week later and voters may swing during the intervening period. But the fact that Yadav looks behind in the race in Bara-2 that remains a JSP stronghold to the party with no organization in the constituency should be a matter of grave concern for Yadav.
JSP’s Ram Sahay Prasad Yadav had not just defeated common coalition candidate Kushwaha, who was supported by NC, but JSP was also the largest party in the constituency on the basis of Proportional Representation (PR) electoral system votes securing 13,242 votes. NC was second with 11,179, followed by UML 9,193, Janamat Party 8,846, Loktantrik Samajwadi Party (LSP) 4,225 and Maoist Center 3,256.
Upendra Yadav also has the support of NC, LSP and Maoist Center as the common candidate of the ruling coalition which together secured 31,902 PR votes in November. He also has the support of Ram Kishore Yadav, who secured 11,043 votes contesting as an independent candidate after quitting JSP in Bara-2, and Rabindra Prasad Yadav, who secured 10,750 votes contesting as a rebel NC candidate.
But Upendra Yadav seems to be trailing Kushwaha despite all that. The main reason for that is that Upendra Yadav is not contesting Kushwaha but Raut, who had defeated him in Saptari, in what appears to be a rematch of that November contest.
Many of the voters Setopati talked to said that Raut and Upendra Yadav are set for a close fight despite Raut not contesting the election. Raut’s magic seems to work the most on youths, women, impoverished people and Dalits.
Aware that defeating Upendra Yadav again in Bara-2 will establish him as the most prominent leader in Madhes, Raut has been staying in Bara in recent times. He has visited all the wards in the constituency, had tea with the voters and talked with them sharing their woes and happiness.
Upendra Yadav has also been based in the constituency but the contrast between him and Raut cannot be starker. Yadav visits with a motorcade and communicating directly with the voters has never been the forte of Yadav, who can neither talk with his eyes or laugh with gay abandon. Many voters complain that he does not listen to their grievances.
Yadav also suffers from the disadvantage of trying to again become HoR member through the backdoor just five months after that resounding defeat in Saptari by engineering the election of his confidant Ram Sahay Prasad Yadav as the country’s vice-president. Many point that he should have exercised patience and waited for five years.
He has always faced the accusation of continuously changing his constituency.
Yadav—who had lost to NC’s Girija Prasad Koirala in Sunsari-5 on a UML ticket in the first parliamentary election after restoration of democracy in 1990 and later joined the Maoist party—rose as the messiah of Madhes following the Madhes Movement triggered by him torching the Interim Constitution at the Maitighar Mandala just a day after it was promulgated on January 15, 2007, as founder of a political advocacy movement named Madhesi Janadhikar Forum.
The next Madhes Movement forced Koirala to sign an agreement accepting federalism. Yadav turned his organization into a political party and emerged as the fourth largest party after Maoists, NC and UML following the First Constituent Assembly (CA) Election in 2008. He was elected to the First Constituent Assembly (CA) Election in 2008 from both Morang and Sunsari districts.
He lost from Morang and won in Sunsari in the Second CA Election in 2013. He contested from Saptari-2, which includes Mahadeva Rural Municipality where he was born, in 2017 in search of a safe seat. But he lost to Raut even in that safe constituency in the recent election.
He has now taken his caravan to Bara-2 and suffers from the same malaise that took him down in Saptari. Many voters complain that he has not done anything for the people of Madhes despite continuously becoming lawmaker and minister in the past 15 years and used politics as a means to get into the government.
The fact that Raut roped in Kushwaha from Maoist Center to defeat Upendra Yadav also seems to be working against Yadav with the Janamat Party candidate looking set to add a few votes on his own on top of all those he looks set to amass owing to the charisma and popularity of Raut.
Upendra Yadav also looks set to struggle to attract all the votes from the second largest party in the constituency, NC, despite the grand old party officially supporting him. He will have to attract as many NC votes as he can if he were to register a narrow win over Kushwaha.

Appointment of Nepali Congress (NC) central member Sunil Thapa as political advisor and former Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) governor Chiranjeevi Nepal as economic advisor to President Ram Chandra Paudel has invited wide-spread criticism.
The president is legally allowed to appoint up to seven advisors though disciplines of the seven experts have not been specified. President Paudel has appointed three including former attorney general and provincial chief of Gandaki Baburam Kunwar as the legal advisor until now.
There is doubt as to whether Thapa, who is also NC working committee member, can provide unbiased political advice to the president who has to remain neutral and act as the guardian of the country.
Paudel himself announced dissociation from all responsibilities of NC after being elected president but Thapa has yet to resign from party positions. Thapa argues that his central membership is suspended and he will not be involved in party activities.  “I will have to return to the party if I don’t like to stay at the President’s Office tomorrow,” he contends when asked why he has yet to resign.
Appointment of a salaried economic advisor similarly has drawn criticism as the Constitution does not envision any role of the president in economic affairs and the president can always invite anyone from the prime minister (PM) to the finance minister and economic experts to understand the economic situation of the country.
Nepal responds that the question will have to be directed at President Paudel when asked why a president needs an economic advisor. He adds that President Paudel is aware of the problems facing the Nepali economy and may have recruited his services to remain informed about how those problems can be resolved.
“Is it not good for the protector of the country to be cognizant of what is happening in the economy in his own way?” he quips. “When Bidya Devi Bhandari was the president she would invite us and ask about what was happening in the economy. The current president may have appointed me as an expert as the economy is in a greater problem now.”
Personal secretary to former president Bhandari, Bhesh Raj Adhikari, reveals that Meena Acharya was appointed as an expert for women’s and children’s affairs also to oversee economic affairs even though Bhandari had not appointed anyone as an economic advisor. “President has to advise the prime minister at times. Experts are appointed to remain informed about everything for such occasions.”
President Paudel is legally allowed to appoint four more experts as advisors but NC General Secretary Gagan Thapa has publicly spoken about the need for the president and the PM to make as few appointments in their secretariat as possible for austerity at a time when the country is facing economic problems.
Thapa points that such measures by PM Pushpa Kamal Dahal and President Paudel, though seemingly trivial, will have a big meaning. “There will be an improvement, albeit small, if they say that they will cut all but essential expenses but increase capital expenditure that has multi-dimensional implications.”  
Economic advisor to the president Nepal argues that appointing just three advisors when seven can be appointed in itself is an austerity measure.
Advisor to the first president of Nepal Ram Baran Yadav, Hari Sharma, points that the president does not need to keep a jumbo team in the name of experts. “There was Interim Constitution when Ram Baran Yadav was president. There was no previous exercise of the rights and duties of the president,” Sharma reasons. “He needed comparatively more advisors then. The Constitution has specified everything now. Bidya Devi Bhandari has served two terms as per that Constitution. I don’t feel there is need for a jumbo team to advise the president now.”
He explains that the president partly constitutes all three organs of the state giving examples of how the president administers oath of office and secrecy to the chief justice and grants presidential pardons on recommendation of the Cabinet; authenticates acts and ordinances and calls House sessions; and appoints ambassadors of the country and receives credentials from envoys of other countries.
He adds that the Constitution has specified the role and duties of the president, and there is provision for the secretariat to facilitate fulfillment of those duties. “What kinds of experts and associates are needed for those works depends on the needs and the situation of the country,” he adds. “One may even argue, for the sake of argument, that a chef is needed for advice on cooking as the president hosts domestic and foreign guests.”

The Supreme Court (SC) has refused to issue interim order in the writ petition filed against the Office of the Attorney General (OAG) for not trying Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) President Rabi Lamichhane over passport controversy.
A single bench of Justice Hari Prasad Phuyal conducting the first hearing in the petition filed by Yuvaraj Paudel on Wednesday has refused to issue the interim order pointing that some of the issues raised in the petition have already been addressed in the SC verdict on validity of Lamichhane’s citizenship while other issues will be addressed when issuing the final verdict on the current petition.
The bench, however, has sought written response from the defendants within 15 days explaining why the orders demanded by the petitioner need not be issued. The petition has made the OAG, Kathmandu District Attorney Office, Nepal Police Headquarters and others as defendants.
A single bench of Justice Anil Kumar Sinha was scheduled to hear the petition on Tuesday but Justice Sinha recused himself from the case pointing that he was also on the bench that had heard Lamichhane’s citizenship case and had already given an opinion. The SC then assigned the petition to another bench.
The first demand of the petition is revocation of the OAG’s decision through a certiorari order. The second demand is issue of mandamus ordering lodging a case against Lamichhane of acquiring Nepali passport by submitting false details.
The third demand is issue of an interim order to not implement, or cause to implement, the OAG’s decision to not try Lamichhane.
Article 158 (2) of the Constitution has authorized the OAG to take a final call on whether to lodge a case on behalf of the government or not. But Paudel’s petition argues that the authority cannot be exercised arbitrarily.
Paudel has cited the SC’s interpretation in the case of Mohammad Aftab Alam pointing that the decision to not lodge a case cannot be taken merely on the wishes of the OAG if the accused appears to be guilty following investigation.
The petition also cites claims that RSP leaders had reached the OAG on the day the decision to not try Lamichhane was taken, and demanded that closed-circuit television (CCT) footage be investigated to find whether the claims are true.
Attorney General Din Mani Pokharel on March 20 had decided to not lodge case against Lamichhane.
The District Government Attorney’s Office (DGAO), Kathmandu had submitted a report including the decision to not lodge a case against Lamichhane to the High Court Government Attorney’s Office, Patan.
Any proposal to not lodge case has to be sent to the High Court Government Attorney’s Office, and the office will have to study the proposal and send a report to the Office of Attorney General (OAG) if it also decides to not lodge case.
The High Court Government Attorney’s Office, Patan had endorsed the decision of DGAO and submitted the file to the OAG.
The DGAO based its decision to not lodge a case mainly on four grounds.
The fact that the immigration records do not show that Lamichhane used the passport (No 08834838) acquired in 2015 as the first ground to not lodge the case, according to Neupane.
The second ground for not lodging the case is that he was a Nepali citizen by descent before becoming American citizen and his status was that of non-resident Nepali and not that of a foreigner.
The fact that the disputed passport has been revoked by the Department of Immigration and he has already reacquired Nepali citizenship has been used as the third ground by the DGAO for not lodging the case.
It has used the recommendation to not lodge a case made in the report submitted by the District Police Range, Kathmandu, after completing its long investigation on Lamichhane’s passport as the fourth reason for not lodging case.
Lamichhane was accused of acquiring a Nepali passport using his invalid Nepali citizenship certificate while he still held a United States passport.
Police were investigating a case filed against Lamichhane alleging that he had acquired a Nepali passport by providing false details.
A writ petition had been filed at the Supreme Court over Lamichhane’s citizenship controversy before that.
After the final hearing on the petition on January 27, the Supreme Court had ruled that Lamichhane was ineligible to become a lawmaker as he did not complete the process to re-acquire his citizenship certificate that became invalid after he acquired US citizenship. Lamichhane had resigned as deputy prime minister and home minister the same day.
He later reacquired Nepali citizenship. He also returned the Nepali passport acquired using his invalid Nepali citizenship.

CPN-UML leader Gokul Baskota has claimed that the party will win the by-election in Chitwan-2 with the party voters who had voted for Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) President Rabi Lamichhane returning back to the party.
UML’s Krishna Bhakta Pokharel had won the constituency in 2013 and 2017 but Lamichhane won a landslide victory in the election held in November 2022.
The seat is currently vacant after the Supreme Court ruled Lamichhane ineligible to become lawmaker as he did not complete the process to re-acquire his citizenship certificate that became invalid after he acquired US citizenship.
Lamichhane has already reacquired citizenship from the Kathmandu District Administration Office while the Office of the Attorney General decided to not lodge a case against him in the passport controversy. He is contesting the by-election in the vacant constituency to be held on April 23.
Baskota, who is in Chitwan for around one month as commander of UML’s mission grassroots campaign, has said that the people have seen the greed for power of RSP and how the newly formed party clung to the government on different pretexts and added that the voters will return back to UML this time.
“Why by-election has to be held within five months of election? Who is to blame for that? Who lied to whom and why? Let’s raise the question of morality. Was that right?” he has stated. “Questions have been raised as to whether he has given other false details to the people.”
He has stressed that new force cannot rise overnight and that cannot happen merely due to frustrations, whims, and anger of a few persons. “What changes have the new ones who came promising change brought about?”
He has claimed that UML will prevail in a three-horse race with Lamichhane and Nepali Congress (NC), that has fielded Jeet Narayan Shrestha, pointing how its student wing performed in the district in the recently held free students’ union election.
“We have found why we lost the last time and what our weaknesses were. Treatment for that continues now,” he has stated. “We are working on instilling further enthusiasm in the cadres and convincing the voters. I fully believe big changes have happened. Final touches remain to be given.”
He has claimed that the votes of UML and NC that went to RSP will return back to the respective parties this time. “Some went there due to anger, some due to greed and others to see miracle. They now know nothing like that happens. They also understood that RSP got involved in the game for power. It is already known that no one is God and everyone is human.”

After the final hearing on the petition on January 27, the Supreme Court had ruled that Lamichhane was ineligible to become a lawmaker as he did not complete the process to re-acquire his citizenship certificate that became invalid after he acquired US citizenship. Lamichhane had resigned as deputy prime minister and home minister the same day.
He later reacquired Nepali citizenship. He also returned the Nepali passport acquired using his invalid Nepali citizenship.

Preliminary hearing in the writ petition filed against the Office of Attorney General (OAG) for not trying Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) President Rabi Lamichhane over passport controversy will be held on Tuesday.
Justice Anil Kumar Sinha will hear the petition filed by Yuvaraj Paudel against the OAG decision with the Supreme Court (SC).
The first demand of the petition is revocation of the OAG’s decision through a certiorari order. The second demand is issue of mandamus ordering lodging a case of acquiring Nepali passport by submitting false details against Lamichhane.  
The third demand is issue of an interim order ordering to not implement, or cause to implement, the OAG decision to not try Lamichhane.
Article 158(2) of the Constitution has authorized the OAG to take a final call on whether to lodge a case on behalf of the government or not. But Paudel’s petition argues that the authority cannot be exercised arbitrarily.
Paudel has cited the SC’s interpretation in the case of Mohammad Aftab Alam pointing that the decision to not lodge a case cannot be taken merely on the wishes of OAG if the accused seems to be guilty following investigations.
The petition also cites claims that RSP leaders had reached the OAG on the day the decision to not try Lamichhane was taken, and demanded that closed-circuit television (CCT) footage be investigated to find whether the claims are true.
Attorney General Din Mani Pokharel on March 20 had decided to not lodge case against Lamichhane.
The District Government Attorney’s Office (DGAO), Kathmandu had submitted a report including the decision to not lodge a case against Lamichhane to the High Court Government Attorney’s Office, Patan.
Any proposal to not lodge case has to be sent to the High Court Government Attorney’s Office, and the office will have to study the proposal and send a report to the Office of Attorney General (OAG) if it also decides to not lodge case.
The High Court Government Attorney’s Office, Patan had endorsed the decision of DGAO and submitted the file to the OAG.
The DGAO based its decision to not lodge a case mainly on four grounds.
The fact that the immigration records do not show that Lamichhane used the passport (No 08834838) acquired in 2015 as the first ground to not lodge the case, according to Neupane.
The second ground for not lodging the case is that he was a Nepali citizen by descent before becoming American citizen and his status was that of non-resident Nepali and not that of a foreigner.
The fact that the disputed passport has been revoked by the Department of Immigration and he has already reacquired Nepali citizenship has been used as the third ground by the DGAO for not lodging the case.
It has used the recommendation to not lodge a case made in the report submitted by the District Police Range, Kathmandu, after completing its long investigation on Lamichhane’s passport as the fourth reason for not lodging case.
Lamichhane was accused of acquiring a Nepali passport using his invalid Nepali citizenship certificate while he still held a United States passport.

Nepali Congress (NC) General Secretary Gagan Thapa has taken swipe at economist Swarnim Wagle who quit the grand old party to contest by-election from Tanahu-1 on ticket of Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP).
“I want to say—you have come after doing job, building house and earning pension. I have stayed and struggled getting hit by stones on the streets. Not because I could not go (abroad) or did not have competence,” Thapa said targeting Wagle—who worked for high-paying international organizations before joining politics—while addressing NC cadres after NC candidate Govinda Bhattarai filed nomination for the by-election on Monday.
Wagle texted NC leader Shekhar Koirala, General Secretaries Gagan Thapa and Bishwa Prakash Sharma and others, and told them that he was no longer with the grand old party led by Sher Bahadur Deuba and his wife Arzu.
Thapa took a swipe at Wagle for calling out NC after quitting it and pointed that one should stay and struggle inside Congress to change the party. “My question is not because you quit. But I will also question why you quit if you question me for staying here.”  
He conceded to the party cadres, especially the youths, that not everything was right with NC and much had to be changed. “But will Congress change by kicking it and smashing the windows saying Congress is bad from outside? We should fight inside to change Congress. Should struggle. We must struggle.”

The House of Representatives (HoR) regulation has been passed paving the way for formation of House committees.
The process for passing the HoR regulation was stalled after ruling lawmakers registered amendment proposals requiring House proceedings to be carried out as per the decision of business advisory committee.
House businesses including formation of House committees to conducting parliamentary hearings were affected as the regulation for operation of the House was not been passed by the HoR.
Draft for the regulation was unanimously passed by the regulation drafting committee of the HoR on January 18. CPN-UML was in the then ruling coalition that made CPN (Maoist Center) Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal the prime minister on December 25, 2022 at that time and UML’s candidate Ghimire was elected speaker as per the agreement reached between UML and Moist Center the next day.
But the then ruling coalition unraveled after Nepali Congress (NC), Maoist Center, CPN (Unified Socialist) and Janata Samajwadi Party (JSP) decided to revive the pre-election coalition ahead of the presidential election scheduled on March 9.
UML then quit the government and is now the main opposition party while the then main opposition NC is the largest party in the current ruling coalition.
Lawmakers of NC, Maoist Center, JSP and Unified Socialist then registered amendments in the unanimously passed draft regulation to curtail rights of the speaker fearing Ghimire may toe the line of UML.
The amendment proposals required the works that the speaker could do as per the regulation to be done through the decision of business advisory committee led by speaker and including representatives of the political parties, deputy speaker and law minister.
The HoR regulation has now been passed without the amendments that would have curtailed the rights of speaker after the lawmakers withdrew those amendment proposals.
It, however, has incorporated some of the amendment proposals including formation of a committee led by a female lawmaker for coordination of women in the House, communication to lawmakers about the House business through electronic medium, publishing of bills registered in the House on the website on the day of registration and others.

The Home Ministry has increased surveillance of activities of medical entrepreneur Durga Prasai.
Prasai—who has recently started a campaign to save nation, nationalism, religion, culture, and citizens—has also been organizing different programs accusing banks and financial institutions of excesses.
“We have been observing activities of Durga Prasai. All the bodies routinely carry out political and economic analysis and not just observe him. We will bring to book of there is obstruction in public service, and citizens are hassled,” Information Officer with the Home Ministry Dil Kumar Tamang told Setopati.
The Prasai-led campaign has started the campaign of smearing soot on staffers of banks and financial institutions for their ‘excesses’ from Chitwan. Coordinator of the campaign Shambhu Thapa was arrested by Chitwan Police Wednesday morning for vitiating public environment by spreading rumors in the society through unnatural and demeaning remarks.
Thapa, former Chitwan chief of the Maoist youth wing Young Communist League (YCL), is under investigation and the police will decide on the type of case to be filed against him after investigation.
Different organizations of commercial and development banks, and financial and micro-finance institutions had handed over memorandum letter to the Home Ministry demanding security guarantee after Prasai started the campaign of smearing soot. The Home Ministry on March 3 then instructed all 77 district police offices to provide security to staffers of banks and financial institutions, and stop such incidents of misbehavior.
“Those violating laws, taking the laws into hands and carrying out prohibited activities in the name of campaign will be arrested. They won’t be arrested for merely joining the campaign though,” Tamang stated.
He said Thapa may have been arrested as per the Home Ministry’s instruction, and added that case can be filed against Thapa by the police itself if there are no complaints against him.
Prasai, who is close to CPN-UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli who has nominated him as central member of the party, was expelled from the party on February 25 after he started a political campaign along with former king Gyanendra Shah and his son Paras on February 13.

The Kathmandu District Court has sentenced Manoj Pandey, the promoter of Model Global Visas Consultancy, to seven years in prison in a human trafficking case.
A bench of Judge Deepak Dhakal on Monday sentenced Pandey to seven years in prison and ordered him to pay Rs 75,000 in compensation to the victim, according to Deepak Dahal, information officer at the district court.
Earlier, on January 24, the district court had found Pandey guilty of child sexual abuse and human trafficking. The bench of Judge Deepak Dhakal had found Pandey guilty and sentenced him to six months and ordered him to pay compensation of Rs 50,000 to the victim for child sex abuse.
The court had called another hearing for Monday to announce the quantum of punishment in the human trafficking charge. The court generally holds another hearing for quantum of punishment in cases with jail terms of more than three years.
The District Attorney’s Office had sought a jail term of 10 to 15 years against Pandey in the human trafficking case and of up to three years in the child sexual abuse case.
Pandey has been accused of drugging and raping a minor in the course of a beauty pageant eight years ago. He was arrested on May 21, 2022 and was sent to judicial custody on June 20.
A woman last year revealed through videos on social media that she was raped in the course of Miss Global International 2014, a beauty pageant, when she was 16.
The victim claimed that Pandey spiked her drinks during a program at a hotel eight years ago. She added that Pandey threatened her the next morning saying he had nude photos and video of her taken during the night when she was inebriated and would publish them if she lodged a complaint.
She revealed that Pandey continued to blackmail and rape her for six months. Pandey, allegedly, also brought his friends and made them rape her in front of him during the period.
She stated in the revelations that she took some friends of hers to Pandey’s consultancy after six months and told every staffer there about his misdeeds producing the call records and texts he had sent to her during the intervening period.

The Supreme Court (SC) on Friday has sought all the documents related to the rape case of cricketer Sandeep Lamichhane.
Conducting the first hearing in the appeal by the Office of Attorney General (OAG) against the Patan High Court’s order to release rape-accused Lamichhane on a bail of Rs 2 million, the bench of Justice Hari Phuyal has sought all the documents related to the case from the police complaint to the High Court’s order.
The OAG registered the application demanding that Lamichhane be kept in judicial custody during the rape trial.
The joint bench of Judges Dhruba Raj Nanda and Ramesh Dhakal hearing on the appeal against the Kathmandu District Court’s order to send Lamichhane to judicial custody in the case of raping a minor on January 12 decided to revoke the Kathmandu District Court’s order citing lack of grounds to keep him in custody. He was released on bail of Rs 2 million the next day.
The OAG has argued that the Patan High Court’s order to release Lamichhane on bail is against legal provisions and the SC’s interpretation during bail hearing in cases of similar nature.
Clause 27 of the National Criminal Procedure (Code) Act, 2017 has clear provision for holding the accused of any offense which is punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding three years in detention if based on the evidence available the accused appears to be guilty of the offense or there is any reasonable ground, based on such evidence, to believe that such person is guilty of the offense.
But Lamichhane was released on bail despite sub-section 3 (d) of Section 219 of the National Penal (Code) Act, 2017 stating that a person who commits rape shall be liable to imprisonment for a term of 10 to 12 years if the woman is 16 or above 16 years of age but below 18 years of age. The victim in the case is 17 years.
The Patan High Court ordered Lamichhane’s release on five conditions. He will be sent back to prison if he is found to have violated those conditions.
The court has prohibited Lamichhane from traveling abroad. He is also required to obtain permission from the District Police Range Kathmandu for leaving the Kathmandu Valley.
The court has also asked the police to monitor his activities.
Lamichhane will live in Kathmandu after his release. His father Chandra Narayan said that they left Chitwan and have been living in Kathmandu ever since the case began.
Lamichhane’s lawyers had appealed against the Kathmandu District Court’s order on November 4 to send him to judicial custody until the case is decided. Lamichhane had been kept at the Central Jail Jagannath Dewal.
The Patan High Court earlier had ordered documents from hospital where the victim was born to ascertain her actual age after Lamichhane's defense alleged that she was not actually a minor.
The District Government Attorney’s Office (DGAO), Kathmandu had registered a case against Lamichhane charging him with raping a minor.
The District Police Range, Kathmandu and the Metropolitan Police Circle, Gaushala had submitted the investigation report at the DGAO on October 21 after completing their joint investigation against Lamichhane. However, a case could not be filed against him then due to the Tihar holidays.
Police had investigated against Lamichhane under Section 219 of the National Penal (Code) Act, 2017 after a 17-year-old girl filed a rape complaint against him.
The Kathmandu DGAO has demanded a prison sentence of up to 12 years against Lamichhane as per sub-section 3 (d) of Section 219, which states that a person who commits rape shall be liable to imprisonment for a term of 10 to 12 years if the woman is 16 or above 16 years of age but below 18 years of age. It has also sought compensation for the victim.
Lamichhane has denied the rape allegation in his statements to the DGAO and police. He has admitted to staying with the girl in the same room of a hotel in Kathmandu on August 21. But he has said that the girl had slept on the bed and he had slept on a chair that night.
Lamichhane, who is the former captain of the Nepal cricket team, has been accused of raping a minor multiple times in a hotel room in Kathmandu on August 21.
A 17-year-old girl filed a rape complaint against Lamichhane at the Gaushala Police Circle on September 6.
The girl has complained that Lamichhane took her out to different places of Bhaktapur and Kathmandu on August 21, a day before Lamichhane left for the bilateral series with Kenya.
She has accused Lamichhane of raping her multiple times in room number 305 of a hotel in Kathmandu Metropolitan City Ward Number 9 that night.
Police have also collected CCTV footage of the night from the hotel. The footage shows that Lamichhane had stayed at the hotel for seven hours.
The girl has claimed in her complaint that she had gone to Nagarkot with Lamichhane on August 17 after being introduced to him through a friend.
Lamichhane left to play in the Caribbean Premier League on August 22 after leading the team to a 3-2 victory in the five-match Twenty20 series against Kenya. Rohit Kumar Paudel then led the Nepali team in the one-dayers in his absence.
An arrest warrant was issued against Lamichhane on September 8 and the Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) suspended him from the national team the same day after issuance of the arrest warrant.
Nepal Police later also issued a diffusion notice against him through Interpol on September 26.
Section 219 (2) of the National Penal (Code) Act, 2017 states: “Where a man has sexual intercourse with a woman without her consent or with a girl child below eighteen years of age even with her consent, the man shall be considered to commit rape on such woman or girl child.”

Chief of Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) Police Raju Pandey is found to have abused a female staffer in a way causing her mental stress, according to a report by a committee formed to investigate allegations of abuse against Pandey.
Deepak Adhikari, chief administrative officer of KMC, told Setopati that the committee submitted a 20-page report on its findings last Friday.
The report states that Pandey did not commit physical violence but abused the female staffer in a way as to cause her mental stress, according to Adhikari.
The report has recommended setting up a nursing room for female staffers and a daycare center for children of KMC staffers.
It has also recommended warning Pandey to ensure such incidents do not repeat in future.
Adhikari said that Pandey will be asked for clarification again.
KMC had formed a three-member committee on December 23 last year to investigate on Pandey and directed it to submit its report within 15 days. It had extended the committee’s deadline by two weeks on January 6 and again by a week on January 21.
Gopal Prasad Pokharel was the coordinator of the committee, which also comprised Sumitra Lamichhane and Kumari Rai.
Ganga Upreti, a head constable with the City Police, had submitted an application to chief administrative officer Basanta Adhikari on November 25 last year, and also to Deputy Mayor Sunita Dangol later, accusing Pandey of abusing her.
KMC had then sought clarification from Pandey on December 5, but he had submitted his clarification only on December 20.
Meanwhile, KMC presented Pandey with the 'Mahanagar Gaurav' award on the 28th KMC Day on December 15.
According to a source, there were disagreements within KMC over the decision to give the award to Pandey.
“We had said that a controversial person should not be given award,” the source said. “Basanta Adhikari did not agree. He argued that such things keep happening. It was solely his decision to give the award to Pandey.”
However, Adhikari denied it. He said that Pandey was given the award based on the selection committee’s decision as the allegations against him had not been proven. He said that it was the decision of the five-member selection committee, not his, to present the award to Pandey.
Adhikari himself was the coordinator of the selection committee, while Buddha Ratna Manandhar, Basanta Acharya, Archana Shakya and Mahesh Kafle were its members.

Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) has lifted the suspension on rape-accused cricketer Sandeep Lamichhane just hours after the Office of Attorney General (OAG) moved the Supreme Court (SC) against the Patan High Court’s order to release him on a bail of Rs 2 million.
A meeting of CAN’s working committee held in Pokhara Tuesday evening decided to lift the suspension on Lamichhane, according to a CAN member. Lamichhane, however, will not be selected in the Nepali national team despite lifting of the suspension.

The Kathmandu District Court has found Manoj Pandey, the promoter of Model Global Visas Consultancy, guilty of child sexual abuse and human trafficking.
The bench of Judge Deepak Dhakal on Tuesday has found Pandey guilty and sentenced him for six months and ordered him to pay compensation of Rs 50,000 to the victim for child sex abuse. It has called another hearing on February 6 to announce the quantum of punishment in the human trafficking charge. The court generally holds another hearing for quantum of punishment in cases with jail term of more than three years.
The District Attorney’s Office had sought a jail term of 10 to 15 years against Pandey in the human trafficking case and of up to three years in the child sexual abuse case.
Pandey has been accused of drugging and raping a minor in the course of a beauty pageant eight years ago. He was arrested on May 21, 2022 and was sent to judicial custody on June 20.
A woman last year revealed through videos on social media that she was raped in the course of Miss Global International 2014, a beauty pageant, when she was 16.
The victim claimed that Pandey spiked her drinks during a program at a hotel eight years ago. She added that Pandey threatened her the next morning saying he had nude photos and video of her taken during the night when she was inebriated and would publish them if she lodged a complaint.
She revealed that Pandey continued to blackmail and rape her for six months. Pandey, allegedly, also brought his friends and made them rape her in front of him during the period.
She stated in the revelations that she took some friends of hers to Pandey’s consultancy after six months and told every staffer there about his misdeeds producing the call records and texts he had sent to her during the intervening period.
(Editor's Note: The court has ordered Pandey to pay compensation of Rs 50,000 to the victim, not fined him, as was erroneously reported earlier. The name of the judge has also been corrected since first publication. The errors are regretted.)

                            The BJP is considering fielding Bollywood actor Madhuri Dixit-Nene from the Pune Lok Sabha constituency in the 2019 general elections, the party sources said.

In June this year, BJP chief Amit Shah had met the actor at her residence in Mumbai during his party's 'Sampark for Samarthan' (Contact for Support) program and briefed her on the achievements of the Narendra Modi government.

A senior state BJP leader today told PTI that the actress name has been shortlisted for the Pune Lok Sabha seat.

""The party is seriously considering giving candidature to Madhuri Dixit in the 2019 general elections. We think the Pune Lok Sabha constituency will be better for her,"" he said.

""The party is in the process of finalizing the list of probables for several Lok Sabha seats and Dixit's name has been shortlisted for the Pune Lok Sabha constituency...she is being seriously considered for it,"" the leader said.

The 51-year-old actor has featured in many Bollywood films, including Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!, Dil To Pagal Hai, Saajan and Devdas.

In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP had snatched the Pune Lok Sabha seat from the Congress, with Anil Shirole winning by a margin of over three lakh votes.

On the plans to field the actor, a senior BJP functionary said, ""Such tactics were implemented by Narendra Modi in Gujarat when he became the chief minister for the first time. He changed all the candidates in local bodies election and the party reaped benefits of that decision.""

""As fresh faces were introduced, there was nothing to criticize them with. It left the opposition shocked and the BJP won maximum seats and retained power,"" he said.

According to the leader, a similar experiment was also successfully carried out in Delhi local bodies polls in 2017, where all the sitting councillors were denied tickets. The BJP won the seats and retained the control, he said.

                            An old interview of Johnny Depp has resurfaced where the actor talks about of his fear of getting replaced by Tom Hanks from his breakout film ""Edward Scissorhands"".

In the 1990 dark fantasy feature, directed by Tim Burton, Depp played an artificial man named Edward who has scissor blades instead of hands.

The film was instrumental in the success of Depp and his co-star Winona Ryder and it is considered a cult classic by many film aficionados.

The interview, conducted by host Charlie Rose in 1999, was unearthed by The Hollywood Reporter. During his discussion with Rose, the actor said he was confident that he was going to be fired from the film as Burton would rehearse with the whole cast, except for him.

""He didn't know exactly what I was going to do when I walked on the set, the same thing with Ed Wood. In fact, I spent the first two weeks of Ed Wood and Scissorhands and Sleepy Hallow thinking I was going to be fired, that I was going to be replaced. But luckily Tim was happy with the stuff, and I didn't lose my job,"" Depp said.

Rose refused to believe the actor but Depp recounted an incident from ""Edward Scissorhands"" sets that convinced him that Hanks would soon replace him.

""I can remember when we were doing 'Scissorhands' we were living in this sort of resort, some kind of country club thing, and there was a knock on the door ... one afternoon while everyone was off rehearsing. There were two young girls at the door and I thought, 'Oh, they found me and maybe they want me to sign something, I don't know.'

""So, I opened the door and said, 'How do you do?' and they said, 'Hi. Is Tom Hanks here? Does he live here?' I said, 'What? No. Not yet.' And I was convinced that Hanks would be replacing me. I was convinced. It was one of the most frightening moments in my career.""

Depp collaborations with Burton continued after ""Edward Scissorhands"" and some of their most notable works include ""Sleepy Hollow"", ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" and ""Alice in Wonderland"", among others.

                            Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra posted photos of their wedding celebration Saturday amid reports that the couple had wed after a four-month courtship.

While the couple didn’t say they were officially married — Indian weddings are typically dayslong affairs — they both posted festive pictures of themselves on social media and talked about the work they had put into planning the wedding.

Representatives for the entertainers didn’t immediately return emails seeking comment.

The couple announced their engagement in August. It is the first marriage for the 36-year-old Chopra and the 26-year-old Jonas.

The couple had been posting social-media photos of themselves among family and friends in India for more than a week.

                            Music composer Anu Malik Sunday said he is taking a break from singing reality show ""Indian Idol"" following various sexual harassment allegations against him.

In a statement the music director, who has been attached with the show as a judge since 2004, said he decided to step away from it as he was not able to ""focus on my work"".

""I, Anu Malik, have decided to take a break from Indian Idol as I am currently unable to focus on my work on the show. The channel has been kind to agree for the same. Thank you,"" Malik said.

The music composer's response comes after sources claimed that Sony TV, on which the show airs, has asked him to step down as a judge for ""Indian Idol 10"".

Sony Entertainment Television also issued a statement saying the composer would not be part of the show anymore, which includes Vishal Dadlani and Neha Kakkar as the other two judges.

""Anu Malik is no longer a part of the Indian Idol jury panel. The show will continue its planned schedule and we will invite some of the biggest names in Indian music as guests to join Vishal and Neha to judge the extraordinary talent of Indian Idol season 10,"" the statement read.

The decision comes after singers Sona Mohapatra and Shweta Pandit accused Malik of sexual harassment. Two budding singers also levelled similar allegations against him.

Malik's lawyer Thursday denied the allegations, saying India's #MeToo movement is being used for his client's ""character assassination"". Malik has repeatedly denied the allegations.

                            Actors Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh Sunday announced that they are getting married in November.



In a post shared on their respective social media accounts, the couple revealed that the wedding celebrations will take on November 14 and 15.

""With the blessings of our families, it gives us immense joy in sharing that are wedding is set to take place on the 14th and 15th of November 2018.

""We thank you for all the love you have showered upon us over the years and seek your blessings as we embark on this incredible journey of love, loyalty, friendship and togetherness. Lots of love, Deepika and Ranveer,"" the post.

Deepika, 32, and Ranveer, 33, made the announcement in traditional wedding card format in both Hindi and English. They did not reveal the wedding venue in the post.

Reports of the couple tying the knot have been doing the rounds since early this year.

While rumour mills were abuzz that the actors will be getting married in November this year, the couple chose to stay mum.

                            Deepika Padukone will be playing the role of an acid attack survivor in Meghna Gulzar's next directorial venture which the actor will also be producing.

The 32-year-old will play the role of Laxmi Agarwal in the yet to be titled film.

""When I heard this story, I was deeply moved as it's not just one of violence but of strength and courage, hope and victory. It made such an impact on me, that personally and creatively, I needed to go beyond and so the decision to turn producer,"" Deepika said in a statement.

According to the release, in 2005, while Laxmi was waiting at a bus stop in Delhi, she was attacked by an assailant, a man twice her age, known to her family and an unlikely suitor whose advances she had declined.

The film showcases Laxmi's journey in the time after her attack spanning 10 years, a significant part of the story is the game-changing PIL in the Supreme Court which inspired the amendment on acid laws in 2013.

Meghna said in spite of regulation on the sale of acid and changes in legislation regarding acid attacks, the ground reality is still very grim.

""Acid violence is a very prevalent danger even today. Medical treatment, compensation, rehabilitation and inclusion of acid attack survivors are still very real challenges.

""Using Laxmi's story as a lens, we are attempting to explore these aspects and consequences of acid violence in our society. This is what makes this story, relevant and one that must be told. Because if anything, awareness is the first step towards change,"" she said.

The ""Raazi"" director added that the role is emotionally and physically challenging and she is confident that Deepika would do justice to the character and the story.

""Her physicality matched with what I'd imagined for Laxmi's character. I'm grateful and encouraged that she was so spontaneous in her decision to do the film. When you take a face as beautiful as hers and portray her as an acid attack survivor, the magnitude of the violence and damage is that much more resounding,"" Meghna said.

Deepika's last film was Sanjay Leela Bhansali's blockbuster ""Padmaavat"". Earlier, the actor was suppose to work with director Vishal Bharadwaj and Irrfan Khan on a film, in which she was to essay the role of a gangster. But the film has been postponed due to Irrfan's ill health.

Like a scene out of a high-octane action movie that he would star in, Will Smith celebrated his 50th birthday Tuesday by successfully bungee jumping from a helicopter near the Grand Canyon.

Cameras, which captured the stunt for a livestream on YouTube , showed the actor hooked to a harness and bungee cords dangling over a gorge in northeastern Arizona.

“This is some of the most beautiful stuff I’ve ever seen in my life,” Smith said while still swinging over the chasm.

He described the experience as going “from pure terror to absolute bliss.”

The entire event had the feel of a polished episode of reality TV. Camera crews showed Smith, wife Jada Pinkett Smith and his three children being greeted by dozens of relatives and friends on a platform. His “Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” co-star, Alfonso Ribeiro, served as a host interviewing Smith and others before and after.

The stunt was billed as a leap “in the heart of the Grand Canyon.” But the jump was outside Grand Canyon National Park on the Navajo Nation. The tribe’s reservation borders the east rim of the national park.

A Navajo medicine man gave Smith a blessing and thanked him for coming to the reservation.

Smith said the bungee jump was a challenge from Yes Theory, a YouTube channel that makes videos of people doing activities outside of their comfort zone. But the event also raised money for charity through an online lottery for a chance to watch the jump in person. The proceeds will benefit access to education for children in struggling countries.

                            At the end of the 1991 movie “Thelma & Louise,” the two leading ladies — fugitives cornered by authorities in the Grand Canyon — decide against surrendering and instead drive off a cliff.

One of cinema’s most iconic endings wasn’t filmed in the national park in Arizona, but not for lack of trying.

“We didn’t want to encourage people coming into the canyon doing what was done in the movie, so we declined it,” said Maureen Oltrogge, a longtime spokeswoman for the national park who retired in 2014.

Nevertheless, Oltrogge said at least two people took their own lives by driving over the rim of the Grand Canyon after the movie was released, thinking it was filmed there.

The landscape in and around one of the world’s seven natural wonders has a long history of stunts being staged — or turned down. An acrobat, a magician and overall daredevils are among those who have approached Grand Canyon National Park over the years with visions of a made-for-TV moment.

The latest planned feat will be Tuesday when actor Will Smith celebrates his 50th birthday by bungee jumping from a helicopter. While it’s been billed as a leap “in the heart of the Grand Canyon,” it actually will take place over a smaller gorge on the Navajo Nation, a tribe whose reservation borders the east rim of the national park.

Getting permission to film or stage something in the Grand Canyon means meeting a lot of criteria. Among the outrageous proposals the park has declined was in the 1990s, when now-deceased artist Ron Nicolino collected thousands of bras that he wanted to string across the Grand Canyon. The park said no.

Grand Canyon spokeswoman Kari Cobb said Smith did not approach the park for the bungee jump, but it wouldn’t be allowed anyway. She said the park is responsible for protecting its assets.

“It’s everything relating to safety, impacts to visitors and impacts to the resources,” she said.

Oltrogge said other filming projects were turned down because of their size, the impact to tourism and because they didn’t align with the park’s educational values. The park also has rejected requests for ride-along criminal justice programs, and to launch jet engines from rim to rim.

Todd Berger, author of “It Happened at Grand Canyon,” says the earliest-known publicized stunt he can recall from his research of the Grand Canyon was an airplane landing near Plateau Point in the early 1920s. Ellsworth Kolb and a swashbuckling pilot took off from the plateau below the South Rim and “spiraled” up and out of the canyon in front of large crowds and cameras.

The Grand Canyon is alluring for promotional purpose because it’s “world-famous, spectacular and scary to most people,” Berger said in an email.

In 1999 and 2011, Robbie Knievel, the son of stunt performer Evel Knievel, and Swiss aviator Yves Rossy, respectively, approached Grand Canyon National Park with requests to jump part of the canyon and soar over it in a jet suit.

After being rejected, both men went to the Hualapai Tribe, whose reservation stretches 100 miles (160 kilometers) along the Grand Canyon’s west rim. The tribe agreed, and both successfully completed their feats.

The Hualapai also allowed illusionist Criss Angel in 2010 to be shackled and locked inside a crate that was suspended over the edge of the Grand Canyon.

The tribe is best-known for its Grand Canyon Skywalk, a horseshoe-shaped glass bridge that juts over the canyon overlooking the Colorado River. The tribe’s Grand Canyon Resort Corp. said any event must be respectful of Hualapai culture and consistent with its brand.

“Our Tribal Council would need to approve any proposal, and that’s a high bar,” CEO Colin McBeath said in a statement. “We want to protect the canyon and the businesses we have worked so hard to establish and grow.”

Robert Bravo Jr., a tribal member who has served as the corporation’s chief executive and as a member of its board, said the stunts had been a way to showcase to the tribe to the world. Special permission for filming and photos also is needed.

“They were necessary to really promote what we have and who we are,” he said. “But now that we’re on the map, it’s not as much of a necessity.”

One request the Hualapai declined was when aerial artist Nik Wallenda wanted to walk a tightrope over the canyon in 2013. Bravo said it was too risky.

“The canyon is very sacred and very spiritual to the Hualapai people, and God forbid something happen to him while he’s out there,” he said.

Wallenda ended up getting permission from the Navajo Nation to walk a 5-centimeter-thick steel cable 1,476 feet (450 meters) over the Little Colorado River gorge, just east of Grand Canyon National Park. The roughly 22-minute act was broadcast live on the Discovery Channel.

That is where Smith will be making his big leap.

Navajo Nation spokesman Mihio Manus said any stunt or filming project in the tribe’s Little Colorado River park requires a special permit. Applicants outline their plans and fill out paperwork. If a department manager approves, they talk about the scope of the event and location. Environmental and wildlife officials also weigh in before a permit can be issued and a fee assessed.

Manus declined to comment on Smith’s jump.

The “Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” actor teamed up with charity website Omaze to make his bungee jump a fundraiser. The site launched a lottery for a fan to be chosen to witness the jump and meet Smith. Attempts to reach Smith were unsuccessful.

                            American filmmaker Cary Joji Fukunaga is replacing Danny Boyle as director of the next James Bond movie, producers announced Thursday.

Michael G. Wilson, Barbara Broccoli and star Daniel Craig said the still-untitled Bond 25 will start filming at London’s Pinewood Studios on March 4, and will be released on Feb. 14, 2020.

Release was delayed from the planned November 2019 after “Slumdog Millionaire” director Boyle left the project last month over what producers said were creative differences.

Fukunaga won an Emmy Award for the first season of TV series “True Detective” and wrote and directed gritty war movie “Beasts of No Nation,” starring Idris Elba — often named as a potential successor to Craig as the suave superspy.

The new film will be Craig’s fifth, and likely last, performance as 007.

Fukunaga, 41, is the first American director in the series, which began in 1962 with “Dr. No.”

Wilson and Broccoli said Fukunaga’s “versatility and innovation make him an excellent choice for our next James Bond adventure.”

                            Bollywood actress and former porn star Sunny Leone appeared in New Delhi on Tuesday for the unveiling of her wax likeness at the city’s Madame Tussauds museum, a symbol of changing cultural mores in a country where arranged marriages remain common and celebrity kisses in public constitute front-page news.

The statue represents the Canadian-born, Indian-American actress and entrepreneur’s acceptance by mainstream Indian society even as conservative Indian politicians condemn her porn-star past.

Born Karenjit Kaur Vohra to a Sikh Punjabi family, Leone, 37, made a name for herself in the porn industry before breaking into Bollywood in 2012, starring in the sequel to the hit movie “Jism,” Hindi for “body.”

A string of movies, a documentary and a Netflix biopic have garnered her huge audiences — even as critics have panned her acting abilities.

For years, Leone has been India’s most Googled entertainer. With the statue, Leone joins the pantheon of Indian celebrities — including Bollywood stars Madhubala and Katrina Kaif, and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi — immortalized in wax.

Leone’s rise in India has not been without controversy.

In 2011, Anurag Thakur, head of the youth wing of the Bharatiya Janata Party, now India’s ruling party, and a member of India’s Parliament, sought to censure a TV channel that ran a reality-TV show featuring Leone.

Thakur argued that an adult-entertainment star’s appearance on the show would have a “negative impact on the mindset of children.”

In 2015, India’s Community Party leader Atul Kumar Anjan decried a condom ad featuring Leone as “disgusting and dirty,” and said it promoted sex and could lead to a rise in rape cases in India.

An antagonistic interview with Bhupendra Chaubey of CNN News18 inspired a firestorm in the Indian press and on social media.

In the interview, Chaubey asked whether Leone regretted working in the porn industry, and whether she was aware that Indian housewives worried she would steal their husbands.

Chaubey said some found Leone “completely antithetical to what we perceive as the ideal of an Indian woman.”

While some viewers lambasted Chaubey for sexism, Indian author and marketing maven Suhel Seth tweeted that it was “a mirror unto us! How many people before this interview were willing to be by her side?”

“I don’t see myself the way other people see me,” Leone said in a news conference Tuesday, adding that the statue stood for “women speaking up and women doing what they’re passionate about.”

Kanye West apologized Wednesday on a Chicago radio station for calling slavery a “choice,” and he broke down on air over an old friend.

“I don’t know if I properly apologized for how that slave comment made people feel, so I want to take this moment right now to say that I’m sorry for hurting, I’m sorry for the one-two effect of the MAGA hat into the slave comment,” West told 107.5 WGCI radio in his hometown.

“And I’m sorry for people who felt let down by that moment, and also I appreciate you guys giving me the opportunity to talk to you about the way I was thinking and what I was going through and what led me to that,” he said.

West also addressed a question that left him speechless on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” about why he feels President Donald Trump cares about black people. He later tweeted he wasn’t stumped by the question and didn’t much appreciate how the show cut awkwardly to a commercial break after his extra-long pause.

He said he was just carefully considering his answer:

“I feel that (Trump) cares about the way black people feel about him, and he would like for black people to like him like they did when he was cool in the rap songs and all this,” West told WGCI.

“He will do the things that are necessary to make that happen because he’s got an ego like all the rest of us, and he wants to be the greatest president, and he knows that he can’t be the greatest president without the acceptance of the black community,” the rapper added. “So it’s something he’s gonna work towards, but we’re gonna have to speak to him.”

Late Wednesday, Trump tweeted a link to a Breitbart News story about the interview.

As for the field trip to the Los Angeles offices of TMZ in May, when he wore the “Make America Great Again” red cap favored by Trump supporters and made the slavery remark, West said Don C — a former collaborator, tour manager and record exec — used to “have my back” and likely would have shut him down before things got out of hand.

“One thing that I got from the TMZ comment is that it showed me how much black people love me, and how much black people count on me and depend on me, and I appreciate that,” West said.

                            George Clooney can raise a glass, even if he’s not starring in any hit movies.

The 57-year-old tops the 2018 Forbes’ list of highest-paid actors with $239 million in pretax earnings. Forbes credits up to $1 billion that a British conglomerate said it would pay for Casamigos Tequila, which Clooney co-founded in 2013 with two entrepreneurs. The actor’s wealth also includes additional earnings from endorsements and older movies.

The rankings include on-screen and outside earnings.

Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson ranked second with $124 million pretax. Forbes says a huge social media following helped Johnson nearly double his 2017 earnings because he’s able to negotiate an extra seven figures over his standard contract for promotion.

Robert Downey Jr. was third with $81 million, followed by Chris Hemsworth with $64.5 million and Jackie Chan’s $45.5 million.

""I would like to unreservedly apologize for any hurt and distress caused by a quote in a recent interview with The Times,"" Lohan told People magazine.

""The quote solely related to my hope that a handful of false testimonies out of a tsunami of heroic voices do not serve to dilute the importance of the #MeToo movement, and all of us who champion it.

Pelé was simply “The King.” He embraced “the beautiful game” of soccer in his 1958 World Cup debut for Brazil and never really let go.
He won a record three World Cups and was widely regarded as one of his sport’s greatest players. His majestic and galvanizing presence set him among the most recognizable figures in the world.
Pelé died Thursday at 82. He had undergone treatment for colon cancer since 2021.
Pelé was among the game’s most prolific scorers and spent nearly two decades enchanting fans and dazzling opponents. His grace, athleticism and moves on soccer’s highest stage transfixed all. He orchestrated a fast, fluid style of play that revolutionized the sport — a flair that personified Brazilian elegance on the field.
He carried his country to soccer’s heights and became a global ambassador for his sport in a journey that began on the streets of Sao Paulo state, where he would kick a sock stuffed with newspapers or rags.
“Pelé changed everything. He transformed football into art, entertainment,” Neymar, a fellow Brazilian soccer player, said on Instagram. “Football and Brazil elevated their standing thanks to the King! He is gone, but his magic will endure. Pelé is eternal!”
In the conversation about soccer’s greatest player, only the late Diego Maradona, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are mentioned alongside him.
Different sources, counting different sets of games, list Pelé’s goal totals anywhere between 650 (league matches) to 1,281 (all senior matches, some against low-level competition). When Maradona once interviewed Pelé, he playfully asked the Brazilian how he accumulated so many goals.
The player who would be dubbed “The King” was introduced to the world at 17 at the 1958 World Cup in Sweden, the youngest player ever at the tournament.
Pelé was the emblem of his country’s World Cup triumph of 1970 in Mexico. He scored in the final and set up Carlos Alberto with a nonchalant pass for the last goal in a 4-1 victory over Italy.
The image of Pelé in a bright-yellow Brazil jersey, with the No. 10 stamped on the back, remains alive with soccer fans everywhere. As does his trademark goal celebration — a leap with a right fist thrust high above his head.
Pelé’s fame was such that in 1967 factions of a civil war in Nigeria agreed to a brief cease-fire so he could play an exhibition match in the country. He was knighted by Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II in 1997. When Pelé visited Washington to help popularize the game in North America, it was the U.S. president who stuck out his hand first.
“You don’t need to introduce yourself because everyone knows who Pelé is,” Ronald Reagan said.
Pelé was Brazil’s first modern Black national hero but rarely spoke about racism in a country where the rich and powerful tend to hail from the white minority.
Opposing fans taunted Pelé with monkey chants at home and all over the world.
“He said that he would never play if he had to stop every time he heard those chants,” said Angelica Basthi, one of Pelé’s biographers. “He is key for Black people’s pride in Brazil, but never wanted to be a flagbearer.”
Pelé’s life after soccer took many forms. He was a politician — Brazil’s Extraordinary Minister for Sport — a wealthy businessman, and an ambassador for UNESCO and the United Nations.
He had roles in movies, soap operas and even composed songs and recorded CDs of popular Brazilian music.
Pelé was an ambassador for his sport until his final years but as his health deteriorated his travels and appearances became less frequent. After needing a hip replacement, he started using a cane.
He was often seen in a wheelchair during his final years and did not attend a ceremony to unveil a statue of him representing Brazil’s 1970 World Cup team.
“He gets very shy, he gets very embarrassed,” his son Edinho told Globoesporte.com. “He doesn’t want to go out.”
Pelé spent his 80th birthday with a few relatives.
Pelé spent a month hospitalized in 2021 after surgery to remove a tumor from his colon. Pelé said he was ready “to play 90 minutes, plus extra time,” but soon started chemotherapy.
Born Edson Arantes do Nascimento, in the small city of Tres Coracoes in the interior of Minas Gerais state on Oct. 23, 1940, Pelé grew up shining shoes to buy his modest soccer gear. His father was also a player.
Pelé’s talent drew notice when he was 11, and a local professional player brought him to Santos’ youth squads. Despite his youth and 5-foot-8 frame Pelé’ scored against grown men with the same ease he displayed against friends back home. He debuted with the Brazilian club at 15 in 1956, and the club quickly gained worldwide recognition.
The name Pelé came from him mispronouncing the name of a player called Bilé. He later became known simply as ‘O Rei’ – The King.
Pelé went to the 1958 World Cup as a reserve but became a key part for his country’s championship team. His first goal, in which he flicked the ball over the head of a defender and raced around him to volley it home, was voted as one of the best in World Cup history.
“When Pelé scored,” veteran Swedish midfielder Sigge Parling said, “I have to be honest and say I felt like applauding.”
The 1966 World Cup in England — won by the hosts — was a bitter one for Pelé, by then already considered the world’s top player. Brazil was knocked out at the group stage and Pelé, angry at fouls and hard tackles by Portugal, swore it was his last World Cup.
He changed his mind and was rejuvenated in the 1970 World Cup. In a game against England, he struck a header for a certain score, but the great goalkeeper Gordon Banks flipped the ball over the bar in an astonishing move. Pelé likened the save — one of the best in World Cup history — to a “salmon climbing up a waterfall.” Later, he scored the opening goal in the final against Italy, his last World Cup match.
In all, Pelé played 114 matches with Brazil, scoring a record 95 goals — including 77 in official matches. Most of his goals came with Santos, which he led to five national titles, two Copa Libertadores trophies and two club world championships — all in the 1960s.
His run with Santos stretched over three decades until he went into semi-retirement after the 1972 season. Wealthy European clubs tried to sign him, but the Brazilian government intervened to keep him from being sold, declaring him a national treasure.
On the field, Pelé’s energy, vision and imagination drove a gifted Brazilian national team, with intricate passing combinations slicing defenses while leaving room for players to showcase flashy skills.
The fast, fluid style of play exemplified “O Jogo Bonito” — Portuguese for “The Beautiful Game.” And at the center of it all, like a maestro in command of his orchestra, was Pelé. It was his 1977 autobiography, “My Life and the Beautiful Game,” that made the phrase part of soccer’s lexicon.
In 1975, he joined the New York Cosmos of the North American Soccer League. Although he was past his prime at 34 years old, Pelé briefly gave soccer a higher profile in North America before ending his career on Oct. 1, 1977, in an exhibition between the Cosmos and Santos. Among the dignitaries on hand was perhaps the only other athlete whose renown spanned the globe — Muhammad Ali.
Pelé had two daughters out of wedlock and five children from his first two marriages, to Rosemeri dos Reis Cholbi and Assiria Seixas Lemos. He later married businesswoman Marcia Cibele Aoki.

Pelé was simply “The King.” He embraced “the beautiful game” of soccer in his 1958 World Cup debut for Brazil and never really let go.
He won a record three World Cups and was widely regarded as one of his sport’s greatest players. His majestic and galvanizing presence set him among the most recognizable figures in the world.
Pelé died Thursday at 82. He had undergone treatment for colon cancer since 2021.
Pelé was among the game’s most prolific scorers and spent nearly two decades enchanting fans and dazzling opponents. His grace, athleticism and moves on soccer’s highest stage transfixed all. He orchestrated a fast, fluid style of play that revolutionized the sport — a flair that personified Brazilian elegance on the field.
He carried his country to soccer’s heights and became a global ambassador for his sport in a journey that began on the streets of Sao Paulo state, where he would kick a sock stuffed with newspapers or rags.
“Pelé changed everything. He transformed football into art, entertainment,” Neymar, a fellow Brazilian soccer player, said on Instagram. “Football and Brazil elevated their standing thanks to the King! He is gone, but his magic will endure. Pelé is eternal!”
In the conversation about soccer’s greatest player, only the late Diego Maradona, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are mentioned alongside him.
Different sources, counting different sets of games, list Pelé’s goal totals anywhere between 650 (league matches) to 1,281 (all senior matches, some against low-level competition). When Maradona once interviewed Pelé, he playfully asked the Brazilian how he accumulated so many goals.
The player who would be dubbed “The King” was introduced to the world at 17 at the 1958 World Cup in Sweden, the youngest player ever at the tournament.
Pelé was the emblem of his country’s World Cup triumph of 1970 in Mexico. He scored in the final and set up Carlos Alberto with a nonchalant pass for the last goal in a 4-1 victory over Italy.
The image of Pelé in a bright-yellow Brazil jersey, with the No. 10 stamped on the back, remains alive with soccer fans everywhere. As does his trademark goal celebration — a leap with a right fist thrust high above his head.
Pelé’s fame was such that in 1967 factions of a civil war in Nigeria agreed to a brief cease-fire so he could play an exhibition match in the country. He was knighted by Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II in 1997. When Pelé visited Washington to help popularize the game in North America, it was the U.S. president who stuck out his hand first.
“You don’t need to introduce yourself because everyone knows who Pelé is,” Ronald Reagan said.
Pelé was Brazil’s first modern Black national hero but rarely spoke about racism in a country where the rich and powerful tend to hail from the white minority.
Opposing fans taunted Pelé with monkey chants at home and all over the world.
“He said that he would never play if he had to stop every time he heard those chants,” said Angelica Basthi, one of Pelé’s biographers. “He is key for Black people’s pride in Brazil, but never wanted to be a flagbearer.”
Pelé’s life after soccer took many forms. He was a politician — Brazil’s Extraordinary Minister for Sport — a wealthy businessman, and an ambassador for UNESCO and the United Nations.
He had roles in movies, soap operas and even composed songs and recorded CDs of popular Brazilian music.
Pelé was an ambassador for his sport until his final years but as his health deteriorated his travels and appearances became less frequent. After needing a hip replacement, he started using a cane.
He was often seen in a wheelchair during his final years and did not attend a ceremony to unveil a statue of him representing Brazil’s 1970 World Cup team.
“He gets very shy, he gets very embarrassed,” his son Edinho told Globoesporte.com. “He doesn’t want to go out.”

Industry Minister Gajendra Hamal has resigned 40 hours after appointment. Hamal has said he has resigned listening to his conscience after widespread criticism of the appointment. Baluwatar has tried to spin the resignation by Hamal of his own volition to save its face. The press note issued by Baluwatar mentions that Hamal has resigned on request of Prime Minister (PM) Sher Bahadur Deuba even as audio recording of Hamal requesting to broadcast/publish the issue through the media pointing that Deuba may reject his resignation has been made public.
One fact has been irrefutably established despite all the efforts of damage control by Baluwatar. The democracy in Nepal has been attacked in an unimaginable manner last week.
Politicians and people in the judiciary can some time commit mistakes in course of work and do work that should not be done. But the deed of PM Deuba and Chief Justice (CJ) Cholendra Shumsher Rana with consent of the top leaders of ruling coalition is an unthinkable crime in democracy. CJ seeking share of spoils in the government and the ruling parties accepting that is unimaginable in democracy.
The main source of this misdeed is CJ Rana, and his unconstitutional aspirations. Rana had the temerity to seek a share in power violating the sanctity of judiciary believing he can do anything he wishes.
The ruling coalition should have strongly resisted this impudence by CJ Rana. But the coalition easily accepted his demand reflecting at once the gratitude of the coalition toward some of the past verdicts by CJ and fear that he may put the government in another crisis.
Rana has been enjoying the fallout of the havoc he has wreaked from the sacred chair of CJ and making mockery of democracy. It is not hard to see that Rana has been influencing the court’s verdicts in a way that benefits one party or another, and reaping political benefits for that.
Two major verdicts by the Supreme Court (SC) in cases related to political parties are now under suspicion. The SC verdict to revoke unification of CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Center) restoring the two parties to the state before unification in a case related to the unified party using name of another registered party was against the Constitution, laws and jurisdiction of the judiciary. That verdict was unimaginable.  
The refusal by the SC to issue an interim order in the case against the ordinance making splitting of parties easier issued hastily by the Deuba government after suddenly ending the House session, and subsequent delay in issuing final verdict in the case have also raised suspicions. Every government has undermined the parliament by bringing ordinance and tampered with laws for its vested interests. There will be no meaning of democratic norms of the people’s representatives formulating laws and the rule of law if that is not controlled.
The SC recently had revoked the ordinance brought by the KP Oli government to amend the act related to citizenship immediately after dissolving the House. The court had done a commendable job of curbing the autocratic tendency of the executive to rule through ordinances by avoiding the parliament. The final verdict in that case would have set a good precedent and curbed abuse of powers bolstering democracy and rule of law.
But the SC has again treaded the wrong path in the case related to the ordinance about splitting of parties. The SC has blatantly ignored the precedent it established in the ordinance related to citizenship. The double standard of the Apex Court in cases related to two similar ordinances has not just hit the credibility of the judiciary but raised suspicions that CJ Rana influences court verdicts to serve his immoral interests in connivance with political parties. CJ Rana has himself proved the suspicions to be true by accepting his share in Cabinet expansion.
Opposing such immoral acts of CJ is not opposing the judiciary or attacking the dignity of the court. The judiciary is not an individual justice or CJ, for that matter, who does not remain within the limits and disregards the sanctity of the judiciary.
Condemning such justices rather saves the judiciary and all those honest justices who continuously work with constitutional integrity and cannot even think about treading the path Rana has taken. Slamming Rana will save the justices who twice revived the House dissolved unconstitutionally by Oli going against Rana’s wishes. Criticizing Rana will safeguard the public trust over those very justices who have not participated in the political dealmaking of Rana.
We should not forget here that CJ Rana agreed to reinstate the House for the first time only after three justices in the five-strong constitutional bench stood for House reinstatement. Two justices refused to stay in the constitutional bench formed by CJ Rana in the case against the second dissolution by Oli. The rest of the justices then forced Rana to constitute the bench on the basis of seniority. The constitutional bench formed on the basis of seniority then reinstated the House.  
The current transgression by Rana has provided an opportunity to UML leaders to claim that the verdict for House reinstatement was also given on the basis of political machination. Rana in this way has not just dragged other SC justices working with honesty and integrity into suspicion but also gravely reduced the credibility of the judiciary.
CJ Rana would have deserved impeachment if politicians at the top were not complicit in such grave crimes. Merely demanding share in government would be sufficient to impeach a CJ in a well-functioning democracy. But our politicians are so lowly and decadent that they are condemned to fulfilling the quota demanded by CJ in appointments in the government and constitutional bodies. Oli gave Rana share in appointments in constitutional bodies when he was PM. Deuba gave Rana a share even in the Cabinet this time.
Our politicians will not muster moral courage to impeach Rana due to this background. The responsibility to resist the immoral deeds of Rana is now on the judiciary itself. The SC justices, the Nepal Bar Association, and the SC Bar Association must seriously carry out consultations. Such incidents erode the legitimacy of democracy and undermine rule of law, and the courageous stand of people with integrity and honesty at such times will instill life in democracy and save democracy.
Nepali Congress (NC) that considers itself to be the mother of parliamentary democracy in Nepal and its leaders and cadres also have a huge responsibility. Maoist Center Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who does not respect or believe in parliamentary democracy a bit, defending Hamal’ appointment is not surprising because he believes all the means toward climbing to power and staying are fair. But NC leaders and cadres should seriously contemplate whether corruption of the executive by an immoral and whimsical CJ is acceptable in parliamentary democracy or not? Whether the party president who has committed such a grave attack and crime against democracy is acceptable or not? Whether the party president can continue to lead the party and government in the coming days or not? Why should the Nepali people bear with Deuba who undermines democracy, Constitution and the party ideals every time he reaches power even if the party leaders and cadres consider him fit to be party president? Why should NC under Deuba again be sent to the government?
The coming days will show how people in the judiciary retaliate against CJ’s arbitrariness or those in NC will resist Deuba. But one thing is absolutely clear. Deuba and Rana, and not Hamal, are the ones who should be punished in this episode. The attack on democracy by PM Deuba and CJ Rana, who have repeatedly failed to maintain clean image even in the past, this time has plummeted their image to the nadir of ignominy. History will not absolve them of this ignominy.

Industry Minister Gajendra Hamal has resigned 40 hours after appointment. Hamal has said he has resigned listening to his conscience after widespread criticism of the appointment. Baluwatar has tried to spin the resignation by Hamal of his own volition to save its face. The press note issued by Baluwatar mentions that Hamal has resigned on request of Prime Minister (PM) Sher Bahadur Deuba even as audio recording of Hamal requesting to broadcast/publish the issue through the media pointing that Deuba may reject his resignation has been made public.
One fact has been irrefutably established despite all the efforts of damage control by Baluwatar. The democracy in Nepal has been attacked in an unimaginable manner last week.
Politicians and people in the judiciary can some time commit mistakes in course of work and do work that should not be done. But the deed of PM Deuba and Chief Justice (CJ) Cholendra Shumsher Rana with consent of the top leaders of ruling coalition is an unthinkable crime in democracy. CJ seeking share of spoils in the government and the ruling parties accepting that is unimaginable in democracy.
The main source of this misdeed is CJ Rana, and his unconstitutional aspirations. Rana had the temerity to seek a share in power violating the sanctity of judiciary believing he can do anything he wishes.
The ruling coalition should have strongly resisted this impudence by CJ Rana. But the coalition easily accepted his demand reflecting at once the gratitude of the coalition toward some of the past verdicts by CJ and fear that he may put the government in another crisis.
Rana has been enjoying the fallout of the havoc he has wreaked from the sacred chair of CJ and making mockery of democracy. It is not hard to see that Rana has been influencing the court’s verdicts in a way that benefits one party or another, and reaping political benefits for that.
Two major verdicts by the Supreme Court (SC) in cases related to political parties are now under suspicion. The SC verdict to revoke unification of CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Center) restoring the two parties to the state before unification in a case related to the unified party using name of another registered party was against the Constitution, laws and jurisdiction of the judiciary. That verdict was unimaginable.  
The refusal by the SC to issue an interim order in the case against the ordinance making splitting of parties easier issued hastily by the Deuba government after suddenly ending the House session, and subsequent delay in issuing final verdict in the case have also raised suspicions. Every government has undermined the parliament by bringing ordinance and tampered with laws for its vested interests. There will be no meaning of democratic norms of the people’s representatives formulating laws and the rule of law if that is not controlled.
The SC recently had revoked the ordinance brought by the KP Oli government to amend the act related to citizenship immediately after dissolving the House. The court had done a commendable job of curbing the autocratic tendency of the executive to rule through ordinances by avoiding the parliament. The final verdict in that case would have set a good precedent and curbed abuse of powers bolstering democracy and rule of law.
But the SC has again treaded the wrong path in the case related to the ordinance about splitting of parties. The SC has blatantly ignored the precedent it established in the ordinance related to citizenship. The double standard of the Apex Court in cases related to two similar ordinances has not just hit the credibility of the judiciary but raised suspicions that CJ Rana influences court verdicts to serve his immoral interests in connivance with political parties. CJ Rana has himself proved the suspicions to be true by accepting his share in Cabinet expansion.
Opposing such immoral acts of CJ is not opposing the judiciary or attacking the dignity of the court. The judiciary is not an individual justice or CJ, for that matter, who does not remain within the limits and disregards the sanctity of the judiciary.
Condemning such justices rather saves the judiciary and all those honest justices who continuously work with constitutional integrity and cannot even think about treading the path Rana has taken.

The ongoing pandemic is creating lasting consequences, mostly negative, for the vast majority of persons but youths, especially those from a background characterized by vulnerability and precariousness, are the ones most at risk.
Girls from families with poor economic status, for example, might pay a heavy price if their breadwinners, both mother and father will lose their jobs.
Many years of advancement in girls’ education will be undone with the most immediate consequence stemming out of it being a rapid backsliding in the overall fight for gender equality.
Imagine girls and boys not only from economically vulnerable communities but also from families stigmatized as second class citizens by now-illegal but hard-to-defeat labels inflicted by a society that has been discriminatory for centuries.
The gap between them and more privileged peers will further expand, enlarging a gulf of discrimination that will erode their self-confidence and optimism toward achieving a better future.
Imagine a post-COVID scenario for youths living with physical and mental disabilities: their existence was already hard enough before the pandemic, a life characterized by the precariousness of attending low-quality public schools and the uncertainty of finding a job.
Despite Nepal counting on a comprehensive youth strategy, the lack of its implementation is staggering and worrisome at the same time.
With a government hardly coping with the increasing numbers of infected citizens, it is hard to imagine a bright future for millions of youths in the country.
The return of hundreds of thousands of migrant workers, mostly under 40, will further compound the problems facing the younger population.
Some positive developments recently happened with Minister of Women, Children and Senior Citizens Parbat Gurung announcing the creation of a Social Entrepreneurship Fund under the Social Welfare Council.
Effectively implementing such a new fund could be a game-changer but everybody knows that the challenge in Nepal is not coming up with great initiatives but properly implementing them.
For example back in 2016, the government had established a ‘Youth Remittance and Social Security Fund’, an undertaking also aimed at ""nurturing entrepreneurship among youths.""
This was a great idea but it did not get enough visibility and it is hard to tell on how effective it was.
Even if we solve the implementation problem at the foundations of many positive initiatives that in reality we all know affects the entire governance system in the country, we still need a comprehensive approach to promote opportunities for youth development in the country.
Reimagining the national educational system could be the foundation to start with where a new batch of educators could offer not only quality education but also the passion that comes with imparting classes aimed at forging the future of the country.
More volunteering opportunities available, including to youths from disadvantaged groups could also offer platforms for self-development.
The recent changes toward establishing a viable and effective vocational and training education in Nepal are also promising but the efforts must be sustained and scaled so that thousands of apprenticeship can be really available as a doable option for those youths who feel that their future will be better off pursuing a more technical and practical learning that would introduce them with ready-made skills for the job market.
Scholarships and personal youth development grants should be made widely available to all youths from disadvantaged and vulnerable backgrounds.
Imagine how the life outlook for a vulnerable girl from a Dalit community and her family would change if she had the opportunity to receive a monthly installment for her education and personal development.
There would not be more stress and pressure on her and she would have the freedom to pursue her dream, step by step, mistake after mistake, a luxury so far entitled only to her more privileged peers.
Better collaborations and partnerships would also make a huge difference if business executives were to set up mentoring programs that would allow their junior employees to forge developmental relationships with junior peers from vulnerable background. 
Local and International NGOs could be more inclined to offer internship opportunities to youths living with disabilities and peers from other disadvantaged groups.
Ideally the government could step in, paying for a monthly allowance that would make possible for a not-for-profits to offer internships or initial temporary contracts for the same group of youths.
Finding the resources for all these programs might sound like a fantasy but we all know that huge amount of money have been wasted through ineffective programs or even worse, through mismanagement and corruption.
Moreover more governments all over the world are embarking on a journey of “build back better” that would set aside the traditional concerns for fiscal responsibility and deficit reduction.
If we really want to take the tragedy of COVID and turn into a chance for a better Nepal, we will need expansive fiscal policies even if this requires more debts and more institutional support from external development partners.
Becoming a more resilient country does not mean necessarily getting rid of international help when it is most needed as shown by several southern European countries that need to be bailed out by the European Union in order to survive the crisis.
More importantly what is required to ensure a better future for all the youths of the nation, not just the luckiest ones, is a political wisdom and farsightedness that unfortunately is yet to be seen in the political class of the country.

The contemporary pattern of production and consumption has a plethora of drawbacks. Human civilization is using resources 1.7 times quicker than the earth can produce, and very soon we shall be in a state of extreme ‘resource deficit.' It has become an imminent necessity to shift from the current mode of linear consumption which focuses on ‘take-make-dispose’ to the circular economy model which concentrates on ‘take-make-reuse.'
 
The circular economy is a closed-loop, restorative and regenerative strategy which emphasizes the sustainable use of resources for achieving the 'common good.' Its effective implementation fosters resource efficiency, reduces dependency on resource extraction, buffers against price volatility, reduces costs embedded within production, and eliminates geopolitical tensions. The circular economy model not only promotes an environmental agenda and waste management, but it also opens the world to numerous business dimensions like a ‘sharing economy’ and performance-based business modalities.
 
However, the shift to a circular economy may not be simple, as it requires financial as well as non-financial resources, expertise and in-depth knowledge of product and process restructuring and redesigning. Banks and financial institutions (BFI) can bridge these gaps by investing themselves (for circular banking operations) as well as lending to companies eager to go circular. Leaning toward a circular economy is not only an opportunity for the BFIs, but unequivocally becomes a responsibility as well.
 
Globally, governments, business houses, as well as banks have started on the ethos of circularity. This not only comes with challenges but also with tremendous social, economic and environmental opportunities. The manifestation of circular economic principles which leads to sustainability can be easily seen in the European Union. The United Nation’s Business and Sustainable Development Commission has forecasted sustainability market to be worth US$ 12 trillion a year by 2030.
 
Nepal being a net importing country, the role of banks and financial institutions to promote a circular economy could be even more crucial.The effective lending by BFIs to businesses not only would smoothen the transition to a circular economy but would also create a win-win scenario to all stakeholders involved. For banks, a circular economy would be a productive domain which could enhance their brand through ‘responsible banking.' In the meantime, the circular model would bring economic gains to companies with a reduced cost of production and longer use of limited resources which the earth is losing rapidly.
 
But all the models of transitions to circular modalities might not be promising. Hence existing as well as new business ventures should have a rigorous product and process audits. It would help the businesses to come across the risks and returns associated with the transition and banks could start investing in them after assessing them. Throughout the process, the BFIs could facilitate business with their circular expertise and for this to happen BFIs should also be well-acquainted with circular economy concepts.
 
The scope of the circular economy is limitless, and it takes numerous forms across industries. Banks and their professionals should be well aware of it. Some companies focus on 3R (reuse, remanufacture, recycle), some emphasize in the design of facilitating disassembling and component recovery from the very beginning and some sell their products as a service (performance-based economy). For example: company rents you the washing machine that is taken back by the company at its end-of-life, whereas some share the excess idle and unutilized resources (sharing economy such as with Uber, Tootle, Grab, and Airbnb), while some concentrate on renewable energies.
 
In this scenario where banks are often aligned with traditional lending and the risk is evaluated based on creditworthiness of the borrower and value of collateral pledged, a circular business borrower would be considered ‘high risk’ due to its newness. Further, in the Nepali market, people are acutely unaware of the circular economy, and it is not commercialized well enough. A strong level of public awareness and positive perception of a circular economy would boost the transition, but poignantly, as my previous research on comparative analysis between Nepal and the USA showed, less than 5 percent of sampled respondents knew about the circular economy and its organizational implications.
 
Moreover, pre-requisites and infrastructures like a well-developed secondary market, effective policies on extended producer responsibility (EPR), mature supply chains across industries to foster reverse logistics, cross-industry connection, and regulatory involvement are negligible which makes the realization of a circular economy insecure from the perspective of the BFIs.
 
But remarkably, some BFIs have started to offer green products which also signifies circular financing. The banks can still go further by financing circular projects as corporate debt, or as a lease or by restricting their lending on project which deteriorates the environment. It could also be financed through equity and debt financing (greenbonds) via capital markets. Or non-commercial finance like impact investors, a venture capitalist. BFIs could further launch products like green mortgages, green bonds, green corporate loans, green auto loans, et cetera.
 
Using a public-private partnership (PPP) model, government intervention that places the government as the guarantor can offload the risk for BFIs. Public-sector intervention with legislative and tax reforms can not only alleviate the risk of BFIs but could also trigger traction and investment in a circular field. Well-defined policies on EPR, 3R, sharing business models and palpable tax reforms would bring both the banks as well as businesses on the same table for circular sustainable practices which is a mandate to achieve sustainability, reduce material footprints and materialize the ethos of ‘common good’.

Nepal is bearing the brunt of water-related disasters, once again this year, to such an extent that even the COVID-19 pandemic seems to have been eclipsed. Almost 100 persons have already lost their lives or gone missing due to floods and landslides in the span of a month since the onset of monsoon in mid-June. The cost of the physical damages is another issue because they have to be re-built in the hour of already ailing economic condition. The worst part is, we are not even halfway across this year’s monsoon. While we keep ranting about the water-induced hazards like floods, landslides year to year, one question that we need to find an answer to is how natural are these natural disasters? Are these disasters really natural or human-invited?
Hazards and Disasters
Disasters are often confused with the term hazards. Hazards are actually the natural processes like extreme rainfall, floods, landslides, earthquakes, etc. When hazards meet people, physical properties, livelihood (collectively referred as exposure) in hazard-prone zones (vulnerability), that results in a disaster. Hazards cannot be prevented but disasters can be, to a great extent if not completely. A flood in an area with no people and infrastructure (zero exposure) is unlikely to result in a disaster. Similarly, flooding in an area with proper flood-resilient buildings and infrastructure (zero vulnerability) is also less likely to invite a disaster. Disasters are not the acts of God. They are, in most cases, the utter consequences of human actions. Disasters require human-centric exposure and vulnerability. Therefore, it would be logical to state that there exists no such thing as a disaster that is actually natural. As maintaining social distance reduces the likelihood of being infected with coronavirus, moving away from vulnerable areas will allay the likelihood of disasters.
Water-Induced Hazards and Nepal
The topography together with the climatic pattern are the two unchangeable natural components that renders Nepal prone to the water-related hazards. However, these natural factors alone are not responsible for the disasters in Nepal, it is anthropogenic factors or the human-interventions that set a platform for transforming hazards into disasters. So, which of our activities amplify the risks of disaster and how?
The fundamental matter we first need to understand is that the nature hinges on the equilibrium among its multiple components. Moreover, this balance is constantly renewed due to the dynamic nature of the natural processes. Of the several components, the balance among the rain, land and rivers is necessary for reducing the probability of disasters. Any undue alteration in one of these components may have a cascading effect on the other. The crux of the water-induced problems in the context of Nepal lies in the disturbance of this very equilibrium.
Extreme rainfall events are not a new phenomenon in Nepal although their frequency might have been increased in the recent years. Furthermore, in the recent years, the incidents of disasters are on the rise even during the normal rainfall. There is a little or no direct control over the rainfall pattern. Hence, this shifts us to the next component, the land.
The stress on the hills and mountains is greater than ever and increasing rapidly which can mainly be attributed to the unplanned and unscientific construction activities (along with tectonic activities).There is a rising race among the local communities and the local-level governments to open-up road tracks simply by excavating the hills disregarding the engineering, topography, and geology and drainage system. There is no denying the fact that the road networks are vital to the overall livelihood and the development of the hill communities. However, if the roads that are meant for supporting the livelihood are putting people’s life and property further into risk, there has to be something wrong in our approach. To add an example, concrete buildings have replaced the traditionally stone-thatched buildings in the steep hilly terrain. We need to acknowledge the fact that the hills/mountains and the plain areas cannot be treated in the same manner in terms of construction activities. Most of the landslides and debris flow damages consequently are reported in the vicinity of such areas. Rather than moving away from the hazard-prone areas, people are moving toward them.
Hills and mountains which act as a zone of supply of water and the sediments to the rivers downstream, once disturbed, will have an adverse effect on the overall river processes. For example, high sediments eroded from the Chure hills have left the river-bed downstream rise consistently which has amplified the flood-inundation risks in the adjacent floodplain. Furthermore, the indiscriminate sand mining has caused the frequent and unpredictable shifting of river channels and damaged the hydraulic structures. The basic theory of water-science (termed as hydraulics) are seen to be ignored in many of our river management works. For example, the river cross-section is naturally meant to be trapezoidal which can convey the flood discharge in the best possible manner. However, even in the Kathmandu Valley just to provide an extra space to the roads, the rivers are turned into a rectangular canal like shape by constructing the vertical walls along the banks. If we do not give rivers the way, they will find their way which is evident from the frequent flooding of different riverbank areas of the Kathmandu Valley in recent years. Unplanned land use and the consequent urbanization in the Tarai have exacerbated the drainage problem and resulted in persistent waterlogging with every rainfall event. Whenever the media reports issues like illegal sand-mining, river encroachment, hill excavation, etc., they are often treated as a local issue and seldom make any national impact.
To sum up, it is not just the four months of monsoon that is causing the problem rather it is both our actions and inactions in the rest of the eight months that have been reflected in the disasters during the monsoon.
Concluding Remarks
It should be clear that human actions are the catalyst of disasters and how we manage our actions will dictate their impact on the community. Since natural disasters comprises of multiple dimensions, it is beyond the control of a single institution. Every institution involved either with rain, land or water should comply with the disaster management framework. Management of disasters requires interactions and coordination among the multiple stakeholders where the role of the public is even more crucial. Our approach of tackling the water-related disasters might also need a rethink. The development activities should be in coherence with the sustainability aspect because it is not just for us but also for the future generations. There has never been a more urgent time than now to act. However, until actions are taken, these are just the words on a paper. Finally, the disaster management issue needs to be at the center of all other infrastructure development program and policy.

The ongoing lockdown is exacerbating the already dire mental health situation around the world especially among youths.
On the 14th of May 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) released a worrying report showing the devastating impact of COVID-19 on the mental wellbeing of the people all over the world: anxiety, irritability, insomnia are just a few of the mildest symptoms.
Titled COVID-19 and the Need for Action on Mental Health, the paper calls for a “whole of society” approach to mental health in order to “promote, protect and care for mental health” within the national health system, ensuring emergency mental health care services are provided during the pandemic, and advocates for a recovery from COVID-19 that can build mental health care services for the future.
With lack of proper care and support, individuals already suffering from mental health conditions are having an even harder time in what is not just a physical lockdown but also, with lack of support, is turning into a mental siege.
It is an emergency everywhere from the most developed nations to the least developed ones.
Even a country like Finland that weathered the crisis with a limited number of deaths and whose effective and generous welfare system is often praised, experienced an almost 15% spike in suicide deaths during the lockdown.
The data highlights a broader trend of mental health distress especially among youths in Europe, and those from more vulnerable backgrounds were impacted the most as confirmed by the Health Behavior in School-aged Children (HBSC) released by the WHO on the 19th of May, 2020.
If mental health is often neglected and overlooked in general even in some of the most advanced economies, it is easy to imagine how worrying the situation can be in developing nations, lacking strong primary health care systems.
According to the WHO, a study carried out in Ethiopia shows a threefold increase in symptoms related to depression compared to data before the pandemic.
This scenario applies to many other developing countries and the situation in Nepal is worrisomely similar.
A survey conducted by Transcultural Psychosocial Organization (TPO) Nepal, one of the most authoritative organizations in matter of mental health in the country, during the peak of the ongoing lockdown, showed that 18 percent of the respondents experienced restlessness while 37 percent was exposed to anxiety.
A developing country with a weak national health care system, Nepal can count on a very limited number of mental health specialists, mostly in the Kathmandu Valley, who are unable to meet the demand even in normal times.
In addition, there have been several not-for-profit organizations like TPO Nepal and Koshish Nepal, trying their best to mend the vast gulf between the pressing needs and availability of assistance, often by providing direct essential services for people suffering from a variety of mental conditions.
While all these initiatives are praiseworthy, how can their efforts be sustained, supported, and even more importantly, scaled up?
Obviously the government at all the levels, should understand how investing in mental wellbeing is going to be essential, but the real challenge in Nepal and elsewhere in the developing world, is how to ensure that mental health, amid a myriad of pressing issues including extremely weak traditional primary health care services, receive due importance.
The only way to generate interest on mental health, perhaps, is to really go mainstream, finding creative ways to enlist youngsters as well as adult citizens realizing that each one of them is not immune from potential mental health conditions in the future.
The challenge is how we can expand this conversation not only in these times of COVID-19 driven anxiety, but also hopefully in soon to be better times, involving larger part of the society.
The WHO came up with a Special Initiative for Mental Health for 2019-2023 that builds on a potentially revolutionary Mental Health Action Plan 2013–2020 adopted on May 27, 2013 that defines mental health as “a state of well-being in which every individual realizes his or her own potential, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to her or his community.”
But no one would be surprised if most of the strategic goals and recommendations still remain unfulfilled.
However, lack of implementation should not dampen the hopes for a major overhaul of mental health care within the developing and developed nations as well.
First, mental health should be embedded in the primary health care, and partnerships with not-for-profit sector and for-profit service providers should be established with clear co-financing lines.
Second, we need to create interest and engagement across the sectors.
Educators should play a very important role as schools can become a fertile ground to talk about mental health, linking it to other pressing issues.
For example, while discussing gender equality, we can easily relate it to the unequal impact of mental health faced by women because of the structural aspects of  the society that perpetuate a cycle of violence and oppression that have a negative impact on their mental wellbeing.
Mental health awareness could, particularly in the developing countries, be included together with social emotional learning in the national curriculum, equipping all children with the right tools to navigate their future lives.
Having champions at global, national and even local levels can prove to be very important.
Recently, American actress Emma Stone came forward to raise awareness on mental health, announcing a new digital mental health initiative in the United States which also celebrated the Mental Health Awareness Month in May.
Unfortunately, cultural factors prevailing in many developing countries, mired by conservative mindsets that are extremely protective of any personal stories that could bring shame to a family, prevent a person from coming forward and sharing his/her feelings and situation.
That’s why peer-to-peer support can be a first fundamental step to bring relief and help break embedded taboos.
Even the WHO is recognizing the importance of peers in dealing with mental health as it is promoting the Self-Help Plus (SH+) intervention package based on group support.
Reckoning with vulnerability, as author Brene Brown says, is a first essential step, admitting that each of us, no matter the status and power, can face difficult situations that must be shared, discussed with friends, family members before being dealt with specialized personnel if needed.
One of the key lessons stemming from this pandemic will be a universal understanding that it is imperative to invest much more effectively in public health.
Mental health care is a core part of it and the WHO calls it universal health coverage for mental health, and it is aimed at all people achieving the highest standard of mental health and wellbeing.
There is a unique chance, for many countries, especially in the developing world, to rebuild from scratch a health system that is too unequal and too dysfunctional now.
In the official statement, Dévora Kestel, Director of the Department of Mental Health and Substance Use at WHO, highlighted the importance of “developing and funding national plans that shift care away from institutions to community services, ensuring coverage for mental health conditions in health insurance packages and building the human resources capacity to deliver quality mental health and social care in the community.”
Leveraging the peer-to-peer support that could be easily offered by those persons who have experienced mental health conditions themselves, involving and engaging the broader members of the society in the mission to turn mental health into a global priority can truly make the difference, helping move forward the ambitious goal set by the WHO to guarantee access to quality and aﬀordable mental health care to 100 million more people by 2023.

Citizenship has been one of the more contentious issues in Nepali politics and society since the inception of the post-monarchy Constitution of 2015. While several new acts came into existence, nationality law still has to see the light of day almost five years after promulgation of the new Constitution. At the center of the whole debate on citizenship lies the naturalization rights of foreign nationals—particularly women, from India. Although the fiasco has a gender tint, with many rightly claiming it to be gender discriminatory, the ethnic dimension to it plays a more pivotal role in the lawmakers' willingness to compromise, especially because that very dimension is seen to weaken national security. Let's delve in.
Nepali citizenship is based on the principle of jus sanguinis, which means that a person’s claim to citizenship to Nepal originates from bloodline or descent, largely through father. The first Citizenship Act of Nepal was passed in 1952, after overthrow of the autocratic Rana regime. This Act was ""very liberal on the issue of naturalized citizenship and gave citizenship to anyone who had lived in Nepal for at least five years” (Shrestha 2017 in the Report on Citizenship Law: Nepal). Many consider this liberal nationality law to be “the root of the problem which gave Nepali citizenship to Indian-origin migrants who settled in Nepal” (Mulmi 2019 in TKP). Indeed, the then policy of the state to issue citizenship to the “Indian-origin” people does remain at the heart of the current problem of exclusion and statelessness. To rectify the errors of the 1952 Act and to preserve the “Nepaliness” of the populace by restricting the settlers’ easy access to citizenship, the nationality laws that followed were made much stricter.
The 1964 Citizenship Act, during the Panchayat era, placed restrictive provisions on individuals seeking naturalization in Nepal. A continued residence in Nepal for no less than 12 years, ""in case of a person other than of Nepali origin,"" and the ability to ""read and write"" in Nepali were two such provisions that were not just regressive but discriminatory to the non-Nepali looking or speaking Madhesis. The 1990 Constitution further codified patriarchal norms in citizenship acquisition in that only men could pass on descent to their children and immediate naturalization rights to their spouse. This faulty gender discriminatory provision, along with the already regressive elements of the nationality law, deprived thousands of people, especially women and people from the Madhesi community, of their citizenship rights for years.
In a corrective step to address the problem of statelessness—arising from women's constitutional inability to independently pass on citizenship to their children and/or their ability to provide their spouse a naturalization right, the post-monarchy government rolled out a somewhat liberalized Citizenship Act in 2006. Although the Act provided citizenship by birth and naturalization to some 2.6 million people, it reinforced patriarchy and prevented a mother alone from passing on descent to her children, contrary to a man’s legal privileges that not only allows him to pass descent to his children independently but also to provide his foreign wife naturalization right after marrying her. The 2015 Constitution, while more progressive on some regards, still has some discriminatory and controversial provisions. For instance, although it provides woman the right to pass on descent to their children, it specifies that if the Nepali woman is married to a foreign citizen, she can only pass on naturalized citizenship to her  children—a major source of the current conflict. Another debate is on the issue of naturalization. While the Constitution remains silent on Nepali women's right to pass naturalization rights to their spouse, it states that if ""a foreign woman married to a Nepali citizen so wishes, she may acquire naturalized citizenship of Nepal as provided for in a Federal law."" It does not specify the years of period that is required for naturalization, which is the major source of the current disagreement.
Even after almost five years of the new Constitution, Nepal still lacks a citizenship act, citing the absence of which district administration officers have turned down thousands of citizenship applications. These legal and administrative loopholes have not only deprived people of their citizenship rights but have effectively made them stateless, stripping them of socio-political and economic rights and facilities. The main reason behind it is a major political disagreement on some provisions—one of which is naturalization.
To put it in simple terms, lawmakers have failed to forge consensus on the necessary conditions to issue naturalized citizenship. While the Constitution is silent on the specifics, Madhes-centric lawmakers favor continuing the existing provision of immediate naturalization of foreign women married to Nepali men. While the main opposition Nepali Congress also seems to favor this demand, lawmakers from the ruling Communist Party of Nepal (CPN) have stood firmly against it and seek to delay naturalization by placing certain years of naturalization period. Largely ignored in this tussle and politics of citizenship is the gender narrative, against the gender discriminatory provision—the very source of conflict between the Madhes-centric and 'nationalist' lawmakers.
After years of disagreement, though, the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee of the parliament has proposed seven years of naturalization period as well as a provision of ""issuing a national identity card to the woman after her marriage so that she is not deprived of social, economic, and cultural rights until she obtains her Nepali citizenship."" Despite some initial sign of support for the committee's recommendation, Nepali Congress has decided to back down, calling the proposal ""long and regressive."" The Nepali Congress is again with the Madhes-based parties now to continue the existing provision—immediate naturalization eligibility of foreign women married to Nepali men, given she has initiated the process to renounce her foreign citizenship.
First of all, it is useful to look into why Madhes-based parties are so rigid on their demands for immediate naturalization rights of foreign women married to Nepali men. Nepal's open border with India and the existence of a 'special relationship' between the two countries is no secret. Neither does it require any complex analysis to understand that there have been cross-border marital relationships for not just decades but centuries. While the open border does facilitate the age-old practice, what really enforces it is strong cultural and linguistic ties between the people of the two bordering regions. It may be convenient for the non-Madhesi people to disavow or discredit non-Nepali languages, cultural practices and festive celebrations of Madhes, and Madhesi costumes and lifestyle, it requires a certain level of respect and openness to truly notice and acknowledge the existing India-Nepal border dynamics and people-to-people relations. Apart from the marital alliances, the socio-economic interdependence of the people at the borders of the two countries is much more nuanced than any Kathmanduite is ever willing to accept. In fact, the very reasons also play important role in the cross-border marriages—the prospect for receiving better or giving lesser dowry being one of them.
Due to the above-mentioned reasons, Madhes does really have a literal roti-beti (bread and daughter) relationship with India. This special relationship has been acknowledged and validated by Nepal's nationality laws for years. For majority of the Madhesi people, therefore, marrying across the border feels like their natural right that nobody should be able to strip off by placing any restrictive provision. Against this backdrop, Madhesi leaders find themselves to be the sole protectors of and advocates for this special rights of the Madhesi people.
On the contrary, though, the ruling CPN that has risen to power on the back of an anti-India nationalist rhetoric sees the citizenship issue as a solid agenda to benefit off. Framing the citizenship debate from a national security angle, they not only challenge the age-old tradition of Madhes but also question the loyalty of thousands of Madhesi women by preventing women from passing on citizenship by descent to their children. Madhes-centric leaders, however, seem unbothered by the gender-discriminatory provision on citizenship and are only focused on preserving the men's right to bestow immediate naturalization to their foreign wives. The women group, on the other hand, seems engrossed only by the women's constitutional inability to pass on descent to their children. This lack of coordination between the two groups—Madhesis and women—arising from their failure to spot a vital connection between the descent and naturalization provisions has made both of their agendas weaker. As a result, a prolonged disagreement on different provisions have continued to exist, giving the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee an illegitimate way to expedite the process.
Looking Forward
The committee's recommendation of seven years as the naturalization period, based on votes rather than a consensus, is clearly against the spirit of a liberal democracy. Voting has long been seen as a regressive tool to conveniently silence the voices of marginalized and minority groups. On a subject as crucial as nationality and citizenship, the voices of the Madhesi people should not be sidelined by voting. Instead, there should be an open and rigorous dialogue on the matter, which addresses both the national security concerns as well as the dignity and equality of women and Madhesis through a middle-way approach. This middle-way approach may require a constitutional amendment.
The first step would be to amend the Constitution and provide Nepali women equal citizenship rights. They should be allowed an equal right to pass on citizenship by descent to their children, irrespective of their husband's nationality or presence. By elevating Nepali women from their now second class status, the provision will solve the statelessness of thousands of children whose father are foreign citizens and/or missing. The fear of Nepali lawmakers and leaders of possible ""Indianization"" of Nepal is disrespectful of Nepali women, particularly the Madhesi women, for it questions their loyalty to the state. The implication that such a provision will encourage Madhesi women to marry Indian men and 'sell' Nepali citizenship is unfortunate and pathetic, for the provision simply allows their children to be rightful Nepali citizens if they so want. Any loophole can be mitigated through another gender-equal provision—on naturalization.
The current Constitution is silent on Nepali women's right to provide their foreign spouse a naturalization eligibility. To address this fault as well as the ongoing debate on naturalization of foreign women married to Nepali men, the Constitution should be amended to include one gender-neutral provision for naturalization. That gender-neutral provision could well place a naturalization period—the same number of years for both men and women—before a foreign national can apply for Nepali citizenship. The committee's recommendation of seven years, for instance, could then be codified, and the Madhesi leaders' concerns of immediate socio-economic rights could be addressed by issuing residency cards or national identity cards; prior to receiving a citizenship, the right to conduct business, attend educational institutions, obtain a residency passport, and travel could all be granted through the same national identity cards. Such a provision will not create statelessness but rather a practical solution to the citizenship problem. Regarding the lack of constitutional provision to allow national identity cards, the Constitution can and should be amended for this.
Some Madhesi leaders claim that ours is a patriarchal society where a woman moves into a man's house after marriage, therefore, the man should be able to give her a citizenship immediately. This is a silly argument that is based on an unjust premise. Such leaders should understand that our Constitution and laws should not be made to facilitate patriarchy but to uproot it. Therefore, instead of advocating for the rights of patriarchs, they should focus on creating an equitable society, which will automatically solve the problems they seem so passionate to solve.
Other Madhesi leaders claim that because foreign women married to Nepali men give birth to Nepali citizens by descent, they should have an immediate right to be Nepali citizens too. However, this argument, too, is silly and regressive. Such leaders fail to spot the root cause of the problem, which is patriarchy and not the law that upholds it. As mentioned above, a gender-equal Citizenship Act, which allows women the right to pass on citizenship by descent to their children, will leave no ground for such arguments. A child born to a Nepali parent, irrespective of the parent's gender, will have citizenship by descent. Similarly, a foreign national married to a Nepali citizen, irrespective of the gender, will obtain a naturalized citizenship after a certain number of years. During those years, the foreign national will enjoy social and economic rights in the country, after stated and proven commitment to renounce the foreign citizenship and, therefore, a possession of a Nepali national identity card.
Madhesi leaders' citizenship demands are legitimate and fair. They do speak for the existing Nepal-India border dynamics and people-to-people experiences. However, they seem to be hitting on the wrong nail. They are so blinded by patriarchy and identity politics that they cannot locate the true genesis of the citizenship problem. Women groups also seem too oblivious to some issues and so drowned in other that they do not see any possibility of working together with the Madhesi leaders. In Nepal's context, ethnic discrimination against the Madhesis has an interesting link with patriarchy and gender discrimination—and vice versa. Until we see this unfortunate instance of one substantiating the other, we will not be able to move forward in a progressive way, be it the citizenship dispute or any other socio-political discrimination.

The entire world has been plagued by the COVID-19 pandemic, and Nepal is no exception. The public transport system has undoubtedly bore the brunt of the pandemic. Like all other sectors, this sector in Nepal has also been in lockdown since March 24th. In the Nepali context, the roads and the aerial networks are the only reliable modes of public transport.
The government has decided that the essential services would continue to operate despite the lockdown. Consequently, the vehicles and the transport workers are delivering food items and fuel while risking their own lives to serve the nation and its citizens. Figures indicate that there are around 400,000 public vehicles in Nepal. The number of booking staff, drivers, conductors and the helpers employed in the public transportation sector is estimated to be around a million.
More than 99 percent of the public vehicles in Nepal are operated by the private sector. There are neither multinationals nor big companies at the national level that employ thousands of workers. 60 percent of the public vehicles have created self-employment for the owners. Only in  Kathmandu Valley there are 12,000 city taxis, 200 green-plated authorized taxis at the international airport, and approximately 70,000 e-rickshaws and auto tempos plying all over the nation. Most of them are self-employed among which the majority have taken loans from banks to buy their vehicles. When these vehicles have been taken off the road due to the lockdown, on the one hand, the lack of employment has made living conditions worse day by day while on the other hand there is an impending crisis on how to repay the principal and the interest on their loans. There is uncertainty on how this sector will resume operation after the lockdown and what the future of the workers employed in this sector will be. Preliminary studies indicate that around 200,000 transport workers are at a certain risk of losing their employment. This number is only expected to rise with the passage of time.
In the global context, the public transport system in London is estimated to face a loss of around 500 million pounds. The British government has therefore introduced relief for the workers. The government has announced that the state would provide 80 percent of their previous income for those workers who were earning up to twenty-five hundred pounds a month. Similarly in San Francisco of the US, the loss from the sale of tickets and parking fees would amount to US$ 44 million in a month. The American government has given a grant of US$ 500 million for 'Bay Area Rapid Transit'.
In Singapore, the government has decided to provide from 300 to 1,000 Singapore dollars for the city taxi drivers as per their respective conditions, while waiving road taxes and parking fees.
Among the international airline companies, Malaysia's Malindo Air and Air Asia are seen to be at a higher risk. Garuda Airlines from Indonesia has already declared that it will not renew the agreements of contract workers. Thai Airways has also ceased its operations from  April 4 and 10-40 percent cut in remuneration has already been announced. Similarly, Singapore Airlines has slashed the pay of its first officers and captains by 55 percent.
But the Singapore government has set aside 11 percent of the GDP (55 billion Singapore dollars) for relief package to the workers and their businesses. Even India has declared a relief package of 11 percent of the GDP amounting to US$ 260 billion under the self-sufficient movement for small and medium businesses, farmers, and workers. Many other countries have pledged big amounts as relief to get the businesses, workers, and farmers through this pandemic.
In the Nepali civil aviation context, there are nine helicopter and passenger airline companies in operation. 3,500 workers are directly employed by these companies. The umbrella organization of these companies has declared that there will be no cut in pay for those who had been earning less than Rs 20,000 per month while for those earning more than that amount, the pay would be cut on a proportional basis.
The pandemic has affected Nepal in roughly the same proportion to the global community. But the government has not been able to announce any significant relief package. The transport sector is even more ignored and disregarded by the state.
Even if the lockdown is removed and public vehicles permitted to resume their services within a few days, there will be confusion and uncertainty on how to operate the vehicles for the first few months. It is difficult to tell what the future of the transport workers will look like. These businesses and the workers have been facing certain types of problems during the lockdown, and will face different kinds of problems after the lockdown ends.
The government had declared that it would distribute food items for the daily wage workers and those working in the informal sector, but the relief does not seem to have reached the targeted groups. The media has reported instances when rotten or unusable food items were distributed and even internal migrant workers have been unable to receive the intended relief in lack of a proper mechanism. As per the Essential Goods and Services Act, workers including the health professionals and the security personnel have received benefits and insurance. But the transport workers delivering food and essential products have not been provided even a basic insurance, let alone any benefits.
We had hoped that the budget announced on May 28 would address the transport sector positively so that efforts can be made to restore the sector in its old form. But the budget did not contain any concrete contents. The businessmen and the workers working there will survive only if the industries and businesses survive.
The following matters should have been included based on our studies. The principal and the interest repayments in the hire purchase loans should have been pushed for six months at the minimum. Steps should have been taken to end the discriminatory provisions of the Essential Goods and Services Act and transport workers should have been put on an equal footing with other essential workers and be recipients of insurance and other benefits as well. There should have been provisions to subsidize the income tax and other taxes and also subsidies in the interest payment of loans for low income workers and self-employed workers working in the transport  sector. A powerful body for promotion of the transport sector and employment should be established with representation of the professional bodies and trade union in the transport sector under the Ministry of Transport. Although the forming of  transport authority has been said in the budget, it is unclear about its procedure, area it covers and if workers will be properly represented or not? Transport workers should be identified at the local level and given identification cards (ration cards) to facilitate the distribution of relief and food items at a minimized cost to make their living conditions smoother. The budget also failed to include the informal and daily wages workers in the social security program.
The main responsibility of the government should be to provide unemployment benefits amounting to at least the minimum wage to the transport workers who have lost their employment due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The government should have facilitated health insurance for the workers that allows them to be paid Rs 200,000 on recommendation of the trade unions in case the workers are infected with the virus. The import of new public vehicles should have been  halted for a couple of years. After the lockdown when the public vehicles are allowed to operate, the losses that occur while observing social distancing should also have been addressed by the government. A special relief package and subsidies to revive transportation industry on the same footing as other sectors also failed to materialize. The workers that are affected by COVID-19 should be able to take leave and other economic facilities. Similarly, the remuneration of different transport workers should have been secured by bringing separate policies of the government.
Even if the government tries to resume other sectors of the economy, that would not be effective unless operation of public transport resumes. Transportation facility is vital to bring back the city life to normal condition as well as to manage and secure the life of its denizens. In the present context, public transportation should only be allowed to resume operation through discussion with different stakeholders after the pandemic is brought under control to some extent. The following factors should be taken in consideration while operating vehicles.

Initially, the public vehicles in the cities should be brought into operation and that also in some fixed designated routes only.
The duration for the operation of vehicles in those routes should be increased.
The use of masks, gloves, and hand sanitizers should be made mandatory for the passengers and social distancing be observed in seating.
The driver seat should be enclosed with transparent materials.
The conductors and the helpers should have protective gear including the PPEs.
Passengers should be allowed to enter the public buses from the rear entrance only.
Daily cleaning and disinfecting of the vehicles should be ensured.
If the workers face difficulties in their health or lives while working, they should be provided with paid leave.
Atmosphere should be created to minimize the possible skin contact of workers.
Periodic COVID-19 test of those workers should be facilitated.
Discrepancies between the number of vehicles and that of workers should be solved by implementing a rotation basis.
There should be facilitation for periodic social dialogue between the Ministry of Transport, employers, and the trade unions.

In the end, the government is planning to bring Nepali migrant workers back to Nepal. The public transport workers will have key roles in transporting the migrant workers back to their destinations. The safety of those drivers should also be taken into account. It is imperative upon the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport to coordinate with all stakeholders and form a mechanism to discuss on the operation of public vehicles during and after the end of this lockdown.

The government declared Nepal free from caste-based discrimination and untouchability on June 7, 2008. Every year, Jestha 21 is celebrated as the day of elimination of caste-based discrimination and untouchability. Likewise,  the government also passed the caste-based discrimination and untouchability (offence and punishment) Act in 2011 to deter and criminalize caste-based discrimination and untouchability. The Constitution of Nepal, 2015 has also enshrined the fundamental rights of Dalits in the Article 40. Despite all these discouragements, caste-based untouchability is still rampant in the Nepali society.
In more than a decade since Nepal became a Republic, we have witnessed several incidents in which many members of the Dalit community lost their lives due to their caste. The recent incident of this is a caste-based massacre of Navaraj BK and his friends Ganesh Budha, Sandeep BK, Lokendra Sunar, Tikaram Sunar in West Rukum. Another friend of Navaraj, Govinda Shahi, is still missing. This massacre occurred when Navaraj BK, a Dalit, came to a village with his friends to marry a high-caste Thakuri girl. This incident reveals how caste-based discrimination is rampant in Nepal. Even though Dalits are facing discrimination in everyday life, this incident has brought a vivid picture of caste-based discrimination to a wider audience. Another remarkable thing of this incident is its spatial feature—the massacre occurred in West Rukum which was a bastion of the Maoist 'People’s War' which promised utopian vision without caste and class-based discrimination.
This particular incident has shattered all the pretenses of egalitarianism and showed how the Nepali society is steadfast in clinging to the archaic practices despite a number of progressive changes in the country. This massacre of Navaraj BK and his friends in broad daylight has showed how the Nepali society still operates though the calculus of caste. After overthrowing monarchy, the pillar of Hinduism that professes casteism, the country has made several egalitarian changes including political inclusion of Dalits in local governance. The CPN government including the erstwhile Maoists pledged to focus on economic development and prosperity after landslide victory in the general election ensured political stability in the country. The massacre with active participation of an elected ward chairman and alleged blessing of the police has has compelled the Nepali polity to look to revise its governance in order to ensure the freedom from caste-based discrimination, and introduce new concepts, approaches and policies to curb further discrimination.
It is a matter of utter shame that youths in republic Nepal have to get death sentence for pursuing inter-caste marriage. The medieval violence perpetrated by the high caste village upon the young boys has also put the politicians under suspicion. The weak response of the ruling party leaders and former ministers to the massacre has made them complicit in crimes. The high caste local police and politicians who were already complicit in the killings are being given legitimacy by the top level politicians. The high caste nexus of politicians and police is working to protect the criminals giving an impression that the Nepali state is a caste edifice.
 The incident of West Rukum is not an isolated one. Relatives of Ajit Mijar, who was killed in 2016 and whose body is still at the the Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital, are still fighting for justice. Each year, Dalit youths are killed for marrying their high-caste lovers. Each day, media carries the news of elected Dalit representatives subjected to discrimination and Dalit women being beaten for merely touching water taps. Despite the immense contribution of Dalits in the People’s War and the People’s Movement and their martyrdom, they are subjected to torture, manslaughter, stigmatization, discrimination and untouchability in a political system which was meant to be utopic.
The Maoists took support of Dalit communities of the western hinterlands, and succeeded to establish the republic. It was expected that the Nepali state would operate with the values of liberty and equality rather than the Hindu textbooks of Manusmriti. Yet, these incidents show that Nepali state is still casteist, and the Dalits are living under fear and humiliation.
This incident calls for a honest introspection by Nepali politicians. They have to work hard to use the legal tools to curb the caste-based violence. The three branches of the government—executive, legislature and judiciary—has to be disabused of their engrained casteism, and introduce new laws and policies to help and assist Dalits to exercise freedom and equality and help live their lives in dignity.

The field of liver transplantation has undergone remarkable changes over the last three decades. The first liver transplantation in the world was performed in the year 1963. Although the first liver transplant was unsuccessful, it helped in identifying number of important issues, which needed resolution. Thus, the program was put on hold for some years and restarted with the first successful liver transplant in 1967 in United States.
The initial days of liver transplantation were very stressful and over the years the outcomes were improving slowly. After United States and UK, the liver transplant programs developed around the world and now the liver transplantation has become a routine procedure in many big transplant centers around the world. Recipients are surviving 20 or even more years with excellent quality of life. These outstanding achievements have been possible because of massive understanding of the liver transplantation procedure, its immunology along with improved perioperative care supported by the most advanced technology.
Liver transplantation is continuously expanding with improved outcomes and has also become a reality even in developing countries like ours. Having said this, liver transplantation is still considered as one of the most complicated procedure requiring the highest level of dedication and multispecialty involvement. While the focus is more on cadaveric (corpse) or brain death donation in the western world, living donor liver transplantation (LDLT), in contrast, has dominated in Asian countries. Some centers in Asia are now performing the highest number of liver transplantation in the world, majority of which are living donor liver transplantation.
Kidney transplantation had already established itself as a successful program in Nepal for more than a decade before liver transplantation started. The first successful liver transplant was performed in Nepal in December 2016. The team of surgeons from Samsung Medical Center, South Korea along with the local team at Human Organ Transplant Center (HOTC), Bhaktapur performed the first living donor liver transplantation. A 41-year-old man was transplanted a liver from his 39-year-old sister. The country’s first successful liver transplantation created a history in the field of transplantation in Nepal. However, liver transplantation couldn’t speed up as expected. When the first successful liver transplantation was performed at the HOTC, the Tribhuvan University Teaching hospital (TUTH) was also in preparation phase for the same. Over the next two and half years, the HOTC could performed only three liver transplants but importantly with successful outcomes.
Finally after many years of preparation, the TUTH was ready to perform the first liver transplantation. The TUTH is one of largest tertiary referral center in Nepal having all the clinical disciplines as well as running most of the academic programs of different specialties. Kidney transplantation, started in 2008, was already an established program of the hospital for more than a decade. The liver transplant team of Apollo Hospital, New Delhi, India along with the transplant team of TUTH performed the first living donor liver transplantation on 31st May 2019.  A 33-year-old daughter donated liver to her 58-year-old father suffering from cirrhosis. The procedure and perioperative period was uneventful. The donor stayed in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for two days then in the post-operative ward for a week and was discharged while the recipient was discharged after three weeks of hospital stay.
It has been one year of the first successful liver transplantation at the TUTH and both donor and recipient are in regular follow-ups and in good health. The hospital transplant team had prepared for a target of doing around 10- 12 cases per year. However, due to various reasons, only four successful living donor liver transplantation were performed in the first year. After the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the liver transplantation program at the TUTH has been temporarily on hold with the intention to restart again as soon as the situation gets back to normalcy.  The HOTC further performed one more successful living donor liver transplant making a total of four LDLTs. One unsuccessful cadaveric liver transplant was also performed at the HOTC but the details were not published.  So far, the TUTH has not been able to perform any cadaveric liver or kidney transplants.
So far, a total of eight successful living donor liver transplants have been performed in the country. In both of these hospitals, liver transplants have been performed with the support of international liver transplant team. No matter how well a team is prepared and the center is equipped, it’s a worldwide practice to begin the liver transplant program with the support of team members from a very high volume centers. As it is very crucial to have an excellent outcome from the beginning for the success and sustainability of the liver transplant program, the new transplant centers always start with the support of the highly experienced team members. The TUTH has also followed the same principle and is expecting to receive continuous support from the experienced team for the next few transplants. The local transplant team is expected to completely take over and start completely doing on its own after some successful liver transplants performed with the external support. Almost all of our transplant members, be it surgeon or from other specialties have received their training from overseas. The majority of our members have received trainings from the high volume Indian centers while some have been to Australia and the United states. The training period has varied from a year-long formal fellowship to short-term training of a few months.
Besides the HOTC and the TUTH, two other hospitals have also received approval from the government to start liver transplant program. Both of them are private medical schools outside the Kathmandu Valley. However, both of them are yet to start with the first case. Up till now, there are a total of four centers in Nepal with government approval to conduct liver transplantation and two are already performing, in small numbers though. On their own, many surgeons and physicians in Nepal have managed to receive trainings in their respective filed of liver transplantation. The majority of clinicians are receiving formal training in liver transplantation from India. The sustainability of liver transplant program depends on many factors and among them, one of the most important one is having very dedicated and trained team members. The TUTH being one of the country’s largest tertiary referral center as well as a very big academic institute has an advantage of having a huge manpower support in every specialty. Despite the fact that only a small number of liver transplant procedures has been performed in Nepal, the success of these limited numbers has paved the way for a successful and sustainable liver transplantation program in Nepal in the long run. It has also overcome the disbeliefs prevailing in many that liver transplantation is not possible in Nepal.
The cost of the procedure has been an important issue regarding the liver transplantation program. Worldwide it is still considered as one of the most expensive procedure when compared to any other medical procedure. At the TUTH, the overall cost of the procedure is between Rs 2.5-3 million. In one hand, it seems to be a very expensive procedure and definitely out of reach for many citizens who desperately need transplant. While on the other hand, the procedure still turns out to be much less costlier when performed within the country than overseas. Unlike other complex and expensive medical procedures, the government is yet to provide any kind of financial support for the liver transplant recipients. Due to many obvious reasons, the commonest destinations for Nepalei patients going for liver transplant are the high volume Indian centers. Over the coming years, when liver transplant starts getting established within the country, we expect that the number of patients preferring to go overseas will drastically decrease.
The future of liver transplantation programme in Nepal seems very promising. Till date the main focus has been on the living donor liver transplantation. As the brain death donation is already legalized in Nepal, there is high possibility of developing cadaveric liver transplant in future as the safety of living donor is of utmost importance. Any untoward event to the living donor could potentially jeopardize the whole transplant program that too especially for a very young and small volume centers like ours. Besides the development of the cadaveric program in future, we are expecting some financial support to liver transplant recipients from the government similar to kidney transplants and cancer patients. This would reduce some burden to the patients and allow many potential recipients to undergo this complicated and expensive procedure. After some years of establishing the liver transplant program at the TUTH, the hospital in the long run is expecting to perform 40- 50 transplants a year and the preparations are on accordingly. Simultaneously developing liver transplant programs at other centers of the country will also help in stopping Nepali patients going abroad for the transplant. This will not only be of benefit to the patients and their relatives, but also indirectly be preventing efflux of a large sum of money overseas. Establishment of liver transplant program in any hospital also reflects the highest level of care offered to the patients of other different specialties.

COVID-19 or the coronavirus that originated from Wuhan in late December 2019 has spread throughout the world infecting more than 5 million people and more than 360,000 people succumbing to the virus. The developed western countries, such as Italy, Spain, France, the UK, and the USA, are the most affected. Recently, Brazil is hit hard by the virus followed by Russia.
The preventive measures adopted by most of the countries of the world have severely affected the global economy. The COVID-19 pandemic is no longer a mere global health crisis, it is also a major labor market and economic crisis. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has projected that the world is likely to face the greatest economic downturn after the great depression of the 1930s. IMF (2020) projects that over 170 member countries will experience a negative per capita income growth in 2020.
COVID-19 has completely disrupted the global labor market. The great lockdown has halted the movement of people leading to closure of factories, schools, financial institutions, and many more businesses. The International Labour Organization (ILO) describes the coronavirus epidemic as “the worst global crisis since World War II”. ILO (2020) estimates that almost 25 million jobs could be lost worldwide as a result of the pandemic. Hence, unemployment is expected to skyrocket. The World Bank (2020) estimates that about 49 million people will plunge below the poverty line due to the pandemic. It is likely to cause the first increase in global poverty since 1998 (World Bank, 2020).
The economists at the World Bank predict that the Goal 1 of Sustainable Development Goals, “End poverty in all its forms everywhere” by 2030, is seemingly impossible to achieve if the pandemic continues. Further, a study by Oxfam (2020) suggests between six and eight percent of the global population could be forced into poverty, which translates to about half a billion people falling into poverty. The ILO (2020) study estimates an income loss between USD 860 billion and USD 3.4 trillion by the end of 2020. This translates into falls in the consumption of goods and services.
The poverty rate in Nepal hovers around 18.6 percent in 2018/19 (15th Plan, NPC). The multidimensional poverty stands at 28.6 percent. Historically, poverty in Nepal stood at 42 percent in 1995/96, 31 percent in 2003/04, and 25.2 percent in 2010/11 (NLSS – I, NLSS – II, & NLSS – III). The 15th plan aims to reduce absolute poverty to 11 percent and multidimensional poverty to 13 percent by the end of the plan. Similarly, poverty alleviation policy 2019 aims to reduce poverty to 5 percent by 2030, and ‘zero’ poverty by 2043. The elasticity between poverty and per capita Gross National Disposable Income (GNDI) at a constant price during the period of 2003/04 to 2009/10 stands at 0.17 signifying that about a 6 percent rise in per capita GNDI decreases poverty by 1 percent point on an average.
The preliminary estimate by CBS (2020) projects economic growth of 2.28 percent for FY 2019/20, which translates into a fall in real per capita GNDI growth of 6.8 percent. Consequently, about 1.15 percent (335 thousand people) of the total population (29.96 million) expected to break through the poverty trap will fail to come out of the trap. The economic growth of 2.28 percent is higher than the population growth of 1.35 percent, so the falling of GDP growth rate does not increase the poverty, however, it retards the rate of decline in poverty.
Poverty in Nepal is likely to escalate due to two main reasons. First, the Nepali labor market structure is largely informal. Around 62.5 percent (4.44 million) of total employment (7.10 million) in Nepal is in the informal sector, and the coronavirus pandemic has threatened the employment of the informal sector. ILO estimates that the job losses in Nepal due to coronavirus might hover between 1.6 and 2.0 million; in total, 631,000 female jobs and 1.3 million jobs for men are estimated at risk. ILO identifies wholesale and retail trade, manufacturing, construction, and transportation and accommodation as the sectors at high-risk. 56 percent of the employed labor force (3.98  million) are employed in these high-risk sectors and among them, 66 percent (2.62 million) work in the informal sector (NLFS, 2017/18).
Second, is the remittance-induced consumption. About 56 percent of total households receive remittance and about 58 percent of total rural households are remittance recipients. About 79 percent of total remittance recipients use remittance income for consumption. Current Macroeconomic Situation of nine months reveals that year on year remittance inflow decreased by 4 percent, while month on month remittance inflow plummeted by 51 percent. The World Bank (2020) estimates a downfall in remittance by 14 percent and CBS (2020) estimates a fall in remittance by Rs. 163 billion in FY2019/20.
The World Bank projects 16 million people in South Asia will be pushed into poverty and about 12 million people in India will fall into absolute poverty. Likewise, a study by South Asian Network on Economic Modeling (SANEM) projects that Bangladesh's poverty rate may rise to 40.9 percent due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, Pakistan’s poverty rate is likely to increase to 33.5 percent. Similarly, the consumption shock of 10 percent is likely to increase Nepal’s poverty rate by about 7 percent, and consumption shock of 20 percent is likely to increase the poverty rate by about 15 percent. The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to increase the depth of poverty which is measured by the poverty gap index. The poverty gap index of Nepal has steadily declined from 11.8 percent in 1996 to 7.6 percent in 2004 and further to 5.4 percent in 2011 (ADB, 2017). The steadily declining poverty gap index is likely to increase with the labor market and economic crisis brought about by the global pandemic. Further, children below the age of 10 years represent the poorest age subgroup in Nepal (Nepal Multidimensional Poverty Index, 2018). The threat of malnutrition is emerging with the growing concerns about food security.
The global pandemic, from multiple perspectives, is threatening the goal of poverty alleviation. The people living in the least developing and developing countries are prone to plunging into poverty and millions of children being left undernourished. The COVID-19 pandemic is no longer just a health crisis; it has entrapped the global economy into an inescapable labor market and economic crisis. The COVID-19 crisis has made poverty alleviation harder. Skyrocketing unemployment, plummeting remittances, and the great global lockdown will eventually drag millions of people into a vicious cycle of poverty. Nepal is likely to face a sharp escalation in poverty as remittance, the lifeblood of the Nepali economy, is likely to shrink and the informal sector, the most threatened sector by COVID-19, holds the majority stake in employment.
Way forward
Poverty is a major obstacle to growth and development. The government needs to take quick initiatives directed toward those who have lost their jobs and are struggling for livelihood. The government should devise a strategy to provide the relief packages in the form of cash transfers, distribution of necessities, and skills-based employment in public enterprises or construction.
The poverty line as per NLSS-III stands at Rs. 19,261, and the inflation-adjusted poverty line in 2020 stands at around Rs. 36,000. As an immediate response, the government should disburse about Rs 17 billion in relief package to 18.6 percent of people living under poverty. Similarly, the households prone to poverty should be encouraged with entrepreneurship program and interest-subsidized lending should be prioritized.
Likewise, the department of labor must maintain a proper record of skills and experience of returnee from foreign employment. Such records will assist in enhancing the productivity of the human resources. Also, the tourism sector is hit hard by the pandemic, so the promotion of internal tourism is utmost for revival of the tourism sector.

When Galileo supported the Heliocentric model of the solar system through observation, the Vatican clergy forced him to recant his findings - all just because they believed the Earth to be the center of the universe. Galileo famously said ‘Eppursimuove’ (Italian - ‘and yet it moves’) in disapproval. What he meant was that regardless of any of their beliefs, or him retracting his findings, the Earth still moved about its orbit. This is an old example of science denialism and its futility in the broadest sense – because we currently know that Galileo, not the Vatican, was correct. A lot more has been updated since then in the field of astronomy, but science-denial and distrust of scientists is still a major problem today, reflected by a significant number of people. The psychology behind it remains the same as for the disapproving Vatican clergy who accused Galileo of heresy. As much as the scientific process is borne out of human rationality, distrust of science can be said to be borne out of our irrationality; more specifically - errors of reasoning.
To understand why many people are so readily dismissive of various scientific discoveries or facts, we definitely have to understand what science is and why it is so hard for so many of us to grasp it. This is especially relevant during this pandemic; because as much as we can observe how effective science has been in preventing worst-case scenarios, we can also see how denial of scientific findings, mistrust of scientists in favor of conspiracy theorists is spreading faster than the virus itself. Much like how the Earth keeps orbiting the sun, apathetic to our denial, the virus keeps doing what it has evolved to do – replicate to infect as many people as possible. For humans, science is the best and only method we have to understand this pandemic and fight it. There is no viable alternative yet.  Denying science obviously threatens public health and human progress itself.
Problems of complexity
No matter where you are from or whatever your affiliations, this pandemic surely has gotten to you in one way or another. The world may suffer from an economic depression worse than that of 1930, SARS-CoV-19 vaccine looks distant, and lockdown and physical distancing seem like the only viable solution at our disposal. In the face of all these, it is very natural for people to be afraid, adopt a defensive stance, and to distrust authorities. Science-denialism also arises from defensive psychology because to understand scientific literature requires rigorous training – which only a few dedicated and motivated individuals can achieve. The rest of us may feel left out and have no choice but to trust these elites for important decisions. This may informally project an authoritative picture unto the entire field of science - where knowledge only flows from one kind to the rest. Assumption of a hidden agenda may then give rise to numerous conspiracy theories. Combine this with the fact that people become more defensive and make emotional decisions during crisis – we have a perfect recipe for any anti-science movement.
Current scientific knowledge is inconceivably vast, so much so that it is almost impossible for an individual to absolutely master any one field. This is one reason why we hear more about ‘teams’ of scientists as opposed to individuals discovering something groundbreaking in the 21st century. Of course, individual contribution is not yet dead, but an individual is majorly limited. Scientific nuances demand plenty of resources, which is not always possible for an individual or a small lab to attain or manage alone. It requires funding and more people. This is an inevitable problem of modern economics, politics, and the growing complexities of scientific findings themselves. For this reason, we have plenty of areas of specializations – where a small number of highly trained and skilled individuals choose to study one aspect of a certain field in depth in order to become experts. Take the field of infectious disease itself: gone are the days of Louis Pasteur when one scientist could alone pose as an authority. There are microbiologists, clinicians, public health scientists, molecular biologists, pharmacists, nanotechnologists, biomedical engineers who all contribute to their field in their own nuanced ways. These days the field of HIV/AIDS is broader than the entire field of medicine during antiquity – as there are specialists from different fields of science who dedicate their entire professional lives to study just this subject. So for those of us who are not aware about such intricacies and are not trained in any field of science, it might seem too esoteric and overwhelming to comprehend – and people usually trust only the things they can understand. To want to take charge of a certain situation themselves is human nature, whatever the intention. It is thus not surprising why people who are not the least bit scientifically literate are the ones who fall victim to this mentality that denies the validity and credibility of the entire scientific process.
What do we mean by ‘science’?
Science is a process. It is not even a body of knowledge. The scientific process updates and optimizes human knowledge. This involves identifying a problem in our surrounding, forming an initial assumption as to what could be the reason behind it, and coming up with a practical experiment where we observe in an organized way to test whether our initial assumption was right or wrong. If it was right, we then try to check how our process may have gone wrong and where our psychological biases may have influenced our results. If our assumption was wrong, we try to learn what went wrong and how reasonable the experiment to test that assumption will be in the future, learn from it and try refining our initial assumption itself. The goal of the scientific process is not to ‘prove’ our initial assumption but to ‘disprove’ them to get closer toward an unbiased fact with each try.
I have carefully used the word ‘closer’ to indicate that despite the use of the efficient scientific process, we may never really get to the truth itself. We make the best approximation of the truth and that is a limitation brought about by the boundaries of technology, perception, and psychology. This initial assumption is known as the‘hypothesis’. Our hypothesis becomes a ‘theory’when it becomes very hard to disprove. A theory is something that is tested and verified. We should not confuse these two terms. For example, the idea of gravitational waves used to be a hypothesis postulated by Albert Einstein. After testing the concept through the LIGO experiment in 2016, it was so hard to disprove the hypothesis that it became a theory. Gravitational waves are a reality hard to dismiss for now. This is unlike the idea of multiverse – which is a hypothesis not yet confirmed through experiment.
In simple words, science is just a problem-solving tool at our disposal – much like a hammer. We use the hammer to solve the problem of nailing or breaking something. Most of the time we successfully nail a spike or a peg onto a surface, but sometimes it misses and bashes our fingers instead. Sometimes the peg will not go in as expected. We learn from the failings and seek to make a better hammer, or use technology to reduce our work – perhaps invent and use an electric hammer or a nail gun – which are more efficient than a traditional hammer for numerous reasons. Likewise, the scientific process keeps updating information and keeps getting more efficient with each iteration. When we say ‘best science’ in writing, we actually mean ‘best till now’. Some newer areas of knowledge can change drastically as the gaps are plenty (for example COVID-19 research), while older areas of knowledge are harder to change due to fewer gaps in comparison. The more we find out about something the more we know about it, but we also simultaneously broaden the horizon of unknown problems. The scientific process is not flawless, but it is the best system we currently have. We have a duty to improve the process without denying it – because the reality is that, only the scientific process can improve itself.
Science and pseudoscience
Just because science has its practical limitations, we cannot assume anything extraordinary as being true without using science. Creative thinking (out-of-box thinking) is paramount to formulating groundbreaking new ideas and hypotheses, but they should be sound and reasonable than random and disorganized. Because reasonable hypotheses have a greater chance of passing the scientific test. This is where I think pseudoscience and anti-science lose credibility – the proponents argue based on unreasonable premises and unorganized hypotheses. We can thus say with great confidence that they are incorrect and therefore impractical.
When any experimental model is unlikely to get the results it promises – it does not make sense why we should keep on spending energy and resources into it. Credible scientific journals have something called ‘peer-review’ or ‘refereeing’ that exists to check for validity and cogency of proposed ideas. These systems exist to filter unsound information from sound ones and to check whether someone’s experiment or idea was faulty or not. Without proper peer-review, we would not have a standard to judge between accurate and inaccurate information. This is crucial because it is human nature to be biased and to make mistakes regardless of the amount of training – which begs for a foolproof system of checks and balances. Biases are not abnormal; they are natural errors of reasoning which only more training can reduce. Even the most polished papers can have subtle biases – one reason why we do not trust people in place of the process.
Scientific papers have transparent disclaimers and display of methods for this very reason. Now other independent and neutral scientists or institutes can try to replicate their experiment to check if it works or not. If people follow our methods, they should get the same or similar results given that they are sound – we call this replicability – an essential quality of the scientific process. We thus know whether someone is mistaken or not. Pseudoscientific and anti-science blogs and portals however, never really ensure any of these standards. As a result it makes sense for serious scholars and academics to dismiss anything that do not adhere to basic scientific standards – something that the proponents of pseudoscience frequently complain about.
Pseudoscience and anti-science
Below are some popular examples of pseudoscientific information or practices:

Calls to drink cow urine to cure or prevent COVID-19 by popular godmen, priests, and gurus like Ramdev.
Use of homeopathy or unsound herbal concoctions to make sanitizers or medicines against the virus (eg. Arsenic Album 30C).
Some forestry chemist from Nepal mixing random fluids to create ‘Herbal Vaccines’ against COVID-19.
Claims of 5G technology causing COVID-19 despite lack of evidence.
Nation heads suggesting random medical drugs like hydroxychloroquine as being effective before the results of serious experiment.
Christian pastors using faith-healing techniques to fight COVID-19.
Media celebrity-doctors like Dr. Oz in the United States and Dr. Sundar Mani Dixit in Nepal proposing ineffective solutions to prevent COVID-19 infections.
Conspiracy theories like the documentary “Plandemic” blaming vaccines, Bill Gates and China for the pandemic.

Pseudoscience usually overtakes the discourse much to the detriment of human progress - credible websites only get a few thousand hits, but pseudoscientific and conspiracy websites get millions. Its proponents usually have double standards or none at all. They are severely marred by confirmation biases – affirm only the information that support and reject those that challenge their deeply held beliefs. In short, they tend to cherry-pick information that suits them. Absence of critical thinking skills and lack of scientific rigor makes it easier for us to fall into this trap of misinformation. Pseudoscience includes easily understandable but erroneous premises and propagates in an attention-grabbing and sensationalist manner. This also explains why it is so easy for it to spread as opposed to actual science – which is hard to understand despite being correct – and usually requires expertise to do so. The end-effect is mass confusion and definitely harm.
Anti-science differs from pseudoscience in terms of intention. While not everything that is pseudoscientific is borne out of ill intention, anti-science always has a malicious motive.  It could be religious fanaticism, political dogmatism, financial incentives, or a simple desire for popularity or fame. When science rejects their agenda, anti-science proponents tend to dismiss the mainstream scientific consensus and dishonestly churn up counter-productive conspiracy theories, movements or ideas that have no basis in reality.
Some examples of anti-science are:

Climate change denying lobbyists and politicians funded by fossil fuel corporations.
Hindutva proponents like Yogi Adityanath, Ramdev, Ravi Shankar and Jaggi Basudev who try to belittle scientific advancements in order to promote their own opinions, political agenda, or products.
Young-Earth creationist Christians who actively deny the fact of evolution in order to promote their God’s mandate.
Documentaries falsely declaring this pandemic as a conspired plan despite COVID-19 originating organically from wildlife.
Authoritative nations pushing conversion-therapy to ‘cure’ homosexuals and transgender individuals.

Scientists are individuals with their own families, hobbies, and lives. They have their own conscience and dedicate their entire lives to solve problems and help humanity. They are mostly never a part of an organized conspiracy group trying to overthrow a certain culture or the world-order like in the movies. Anti-science conspiracy theories and movements are unfair toward these people and harmful in general as they misdirect public interest toward less productive areas. This is even more so when rich celebrities, media and corporate moguls share false information from their half-baked and ill-informed opinions, which unfortunately have great reach.
Spreading misinformation usually spreads negative news – which is termed ‘negative framing’. Negative news tend to grab people’s attention more quickly and research shows that when unaware people are constantly exposed to negative framing, they tend to get defensive and adopt emotional reasoning to make important decisions which generally lead to poor consequences. They may also fall victim to something called “optimism bias” – when we belittle scientific warnings, people will wrongly assume that they will not contract the disease and tend to violate stay-at-home orders and physical distancing – risking more contagion and endangering everyone else. One famous example is the denial of HIV/AIDS by the then Thabo Mbeki government in South Africa. They denied anti-retroviral treatment (ART) to HIV-positive pregnant women which resulted in more than 300,000 lives being harmed.
Growing inaccessibility of scientific literature
Another major reason why distrust in science is growing could be because of the hard-to-get and hard-to-understand nature of scientific literature itself. The most credible and well-respected medical or scientific journals are usually restricted by expensive pay-walls and the public has to rely on secondary information from science-journalists who usually have various incentives to communicate only the information they deem fit – as is the nature of their job – or do not thoroughly understand science. Adding paywall to science-publishing ecosystems will simply restrict public access – even for scientifically literate people and independent researchers like myself who would benefit immensely from the literature. This could eventually lead to the perception of scientific journals being purely profit-driven and thus being counterproductive to distribution of information and transparency – which could instead reinforce the affirmations of conspiracy theorists and science deniers.
In the 21st century, the scientific community has long recognized this problem and there is currently an immense effort to establish open-access publications, i.e. free from paywall. Some people may argue that maintaining scientific journals is expensive and resource-intensive, as the referees need compensation for their work and other logistical expenses. However, the major publishing companies thriving on a profit-driven model makes this argument less compelling. Majority of research and development is paid for in one way or the other by tax-payer money and yet only 15-25% of all scientific research is currently open-access  - this argument looks strong in favor of advocating for open-access science.
Another solution is for scientific literature to include lay summaries in simple jargon-free language for the common people to understand. Relying on journalists to translate the information and not the original researchers themselves, will create rooms for misinterpretation and miscommunication of crucial concepts. This strategy in combination with open-access online publishing might help make science a little more accessible to the public and adhere to the ethics of freedom of information. Such efforts may help mitigate some mistrust of science, but will not eliminate it altogether. Some people will still choose to deny the facts regardless of access – the goal should be to make them less appealing to unaware people.
‘Eastern’ vs ‘Western’ science
Considering Asia (especially South Asia in my experience), distrust of science can be traced back to the historical context of imperialism. Most Asian nations went through tough periods of colonization by western powers for a couple of centuries until the 20th. Their western conquerors inadvertently introduced the subcontinent to better science but they also applied their knowledge to maintain their power and economies unethically. Having experienced this as a society, many people here tend to dismiss mainstream science as an encroaching “western” concept in favor of an “eastern”one, which they consider benign. Such people usually have their identities and dignities tied to this broad historical context and thus refuse to accept the fact that modern science has no dichotomy and belongs to all of humanity regardless of historical or cultural achievements. The truth is that any idea that is rigorously tested to be true will automatically fall under the realm of science, no matter where they come from.
Popular godmen, new-age Hindu evangelists, and traditional medicine practitioners tend to be very vocal about how “western science” is invading the lives of humankind and how their own “eastern science” has lost significance. They tend to dismiss the obvious and greater benefits that have resulted from the use of scientific methods (such as astronomy and evidence-based medicine), only highlight the demerits of modernity (e.g. disadvantages of industrialization or side effects of manufactured drugs), and exaggerate the latter to gain support among their followers and fans. Rejecting any scientific findings or data that disagree with their world-views and agreeing with only those that complement their beliefs is an essential characteristic of science-denial based on this east-west dichotomy.
As COVID-19 poses a great challenge for modern science, this type of cultural denial of science has been flourishing on social media. People have gone so far as to propose cow-urine as a means to prevent infection – rationalizing their claims with an appeal to their own culture in denial of credible information. This is probably because people have witnessed how this pandemic crippled even the supposedly well-equipped industrial nations and their science – forgetting that it actually allowed scientists to sequence the genome of the virus and release its full morphology in the first place. They also tend to bypass the fact that the very concept of social distancing, lockdown and basic hand hygiene are all human discoveries through scientific and mathematical models. This kind of denial masquerading as a cultural inferiority complex is severely counterproductive  – especially for developing nations. Moreover, to worsen it all, less aware and scientifically illiterate people tend to be more prejudiced and xenophobic during a pandemic compared to ones that are more scientifically literate – and this can be dangerous in many ways. Unless we improve the critical thinking elements in our regional curriculum and make people aware of the philosophy of science from an early age, such mentality will only end up delaying progress where needed.
Where do we go from here?
Denial of scientific facts is rooted in human psychology – especially if we are untrained. It can definitely challenge scientists and policymakers in many ways. I am sure I still have not done justice to this seemingly broad topic, which has its own dedicated experts. However, if you ask me, I would say that we should definitely start fighting this denial by enforcing and measuring basic scientific literacy in every level of education. Nations around the world measure their literacy rates all the time, but I think it would be worthwhile if we could simultaneously measure mathematical dexterity and basic scientific literacy – so that we could derive a roadmap for us to improve our scientific education.
The media and social media companies should ethically evaluate the harms of spreading misinformation and pseudo-scientific propaganda and probably label them accordingly or publish them along with some kind of a warning – like in dubious Wikipedia articles and cigarette packets. Communication strategies must be balanced so that they do not cause too much fear and too much optimism bias. Science should be more accessible and publications funded through a better scheme so that they can sustain unbiased refereeing without turning away independent researchers, enthusiasts or institutions.
There are obviously many ways to mitigate people’s distrust of science, and they should be both-top down and bottom-up. In short, as much as it is the responsibility of governments and authorities to fight such harmful mentality, it is paramount that we also individually arm ourselves against it by honing our critical thinking skills and basic scientific literacy. Imagine if the world had double the number of scientifically literate people as it has today then how easy it would have been to curtail this infection before it became a serious pandemic. Do we even want to live in such a world? If the answer is yes, then we should start with solidifying trust in the scientific method. There is, sadly, no other way.

Nepali journalists in Kathmandu have faced pressure of a different kind in the last two weeks: to match the vitriol of some TV channels in India.
Since the Bollywood actress and Nepali citizen Manisha Koirala has been vilified by several channels in India and even told something unspeakable, Bharaat ka khaaogi aur Chin ka gaana gaaogi? (You eat India's and sing Chinese song) The temperature on Kathmandu social media has risen to the level that would beat the summer heat of New Delhi. This vilification came hot on the heels of Indian Army Chief Manoj Mukund Navarane’s assertions that anti-India protests are raging in Nepal at the behest of China. As if that was not enough, some Indian TV talk shows invited guests from Kathmandu and far from asking questions, started lecturing them on why Nepal should not ditch New Delhi for Beijing. Discussions on one of the TV talk shows last week focused on overthrowing the KP Oli government!
Since the mainstream Nepali media—be it TV, print or online—have largely ignored the relentless cacophony of the repugnant Indian TV channels, the Nepali audience is angry that Nepali journalists have not been up to the fight. Some of them have taken to social media and have gone as far as questioning the loyalty of Nepali journalists to the Nepali state!
Thankfully, the leaders in the mainstream Nepali media are aware that those cacophonous TV channels do not represent the vastitude of the Indian media. Nor do the chest-thumping former army generals or some self-serving Babus and politicians represent today’s diverse India.
From across the border, we have watched in utter dismay how some of these TV channels routinely vilify minorities in India, incite religious and ethnic tensions, sabotage the opposition voice against the government, drumbeat support for it, and promote jingoism when it comes to foreign relations, especially with close neighbors. What they are doing now amid the rising boundary tensions between Nepal and India is therefore not surprising to us, nor does that worry us as much. We know that they are sourcing it very much from their DNA.
What has begun to bother us lately is the China angle that almost all the Indian mainstream media and intelligentsia bring in – even peddle – on almost all issues related to Nepal. The current boundary row could not have been an exception.
The facts on the ground are completely different.
Long before China had risen to today’s prominence, economically and politically in the global stage, Nepal had raised the boundary issue with India. It is also important to note that Nepal’s relationships with India were less rocky at that time, which points to the fact that it wasn’t raised out of an impulse but with a measured hope to correct the historical wrong.  
It was during his July 2000 visit to India that Nepal’s late Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala raised the issue with late Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
The then Nepali bureaucrats, especially in the New Delhi embassy, had advised Koirala that raising the Kalapani boundary issue would overshadow other agenda of the visit. Given Nepal’s good relationship with India at that time, and the personal rapport that Koirala enjoyed with Vajpayee, the former overruled the bureaucrats and raised the boundary issue, particularly the stationing of the Indian Army at Kalapani.  
Kathmandu and New Delhi agreed to conduct a field survey to demarcate Kalapani. A Joint Boundary Committee was given the task of providing reports, which was never completed and the Indian troops continued to stay there. Meetings between the Boundary Committee of the two countries since then have resolved boundary disputes in several places along the 1,800-km long Nepal-India border, except for Kalapani and Susta, another disputed boundary point between Nepal and India.
The Kalapani dispute remained in a limbo for long despite Kathmandu’s continuous efforts to resolve it since the turn of the century.
It again came to the surface in 2015 when India and China agreed to develop Lipu Lekh in the Kalapani region as a trade and pilgrimage route between the two countries.
As soon as Kathmandu learnt with shock about the understanding between India and China on Lipu Lekh, the then Sushil Koirala government sent protest notes to New Delhi and Beijing.
By conveniently ignoring these historical facts the Indian Army chief imputed the China angle to the publication of new Nepali map that includes Limpiyadhura, Lipu Lekh and Kalapani. In doing so he did not only vitiate the environment but also provided fodder to the jingoistic Indian media and intelligentsia.
Many in India seem to wonder why Nepal chose to raise this issue now while it has been there for so long. The fact is, Nepal didn’t choose the timing. She was merely responding to two unilateral actions by India—first, the ‘cartographic aggression’ in November 2019 and second, the construction of the road in the Nepali territory.
India published her new map in November 2, 2019 that included Kalapani region within India and on May 8 Union Minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated the road that passes through Nepali territory. After the publication of the new map by India, Nepal had urged for immediate dialogue to settle the dispute. The Indian side repeatedly postponed the proposed secretary-level talks. When India inaugurated the ‘link road’ two weeks ago, without heeding the calls for talks, Nepal responded by publishing her new map that included the Kalapani area within her boundary.
Therefore, there was no China angle in Nepal’s action, least she was acting at the behest of China.
Instead, the sentiment in Nepal, on this particular issue, is against China too.
Nepalis see China as complicit in this. One top diplomat told me that China was aware of our concern on the Kalapani-Lipu Lekh region and yet it reached an understanding with New Delhi. Officials say Nepal’s boundary agreements with China include Limpyiadhura as a border point. Therefore, there are rising calls in Kathmandu to immediately engage China as a follow-up to the protest letter sent to Beijing in 2015 and solicit assurance that it will not enter into further agreements with India on Lipu Lekh unless Nepal-India resolve the boundary issue amicably.
Once the Indian establishment, media and intelligentsia learn not to be distracted by the imaginary ‘China hand’ on the boundary dispute with Nepal, we can sit together, look at the historical evidence, can see what is in our best interests, and resolve the issue peacefully through diplomacy.
India should also do well to understand how Nepal has evolved over the years, particularly after the Indian blockade of 2015-16. Indian media and intelligentsia often complain that Nepal is tilting toward China and using a ‘China card’ against India.
How I wish there were a ‘China card’ or for that matter, ‘India card’ that we could use as we choose!
We fully understand that India and China are not just two countries, but they are resurgent civilizations in their own rights. They have huge stakes in the evolving geopolitics in the region and beyond. Their rivalry will continue in the years to come but so will their collaboration and bilateral trade. With bilateral trade approaching close to 100 billion dollars and the two economies poised to become world number one and two in the future, their economy and destiny will be intertwined more than ever in the coming years. 
In this scenario, can Nepal, a small neighbor sandwiched between the two giants, use one against the other?
Is it possible that India agrees to be used by Nepal against China? If that is not possible, what makes New Delhi think that Beijing will agree to be used by Nepal?
Nepalis fully understand these geopolitical realities and do not have any illusions about a ‘China card’ or ‘India card’.
At the same time, we do have a genuine commitment not to be used by either of our neighbors against the other.
We will maintain the best of relationships with China and India, and we have the best intentions to benefit from their rising economic stature. I know the real politics is not as clean as this, nor it is as simple. But I am also confident that the collective Nepali conscience will not allow politics to veer off the track or relapse to old ways.
Therefore, New Delhi worrying too much about Nepal tilting toward China or using ‘China card’ is an unnecessary waste of emotions and energy. At the same time, any effort to bring Nepal back into its orbit is a futile exercise.
Once New Delhi reconciles with the fact that Nepal will pursue her best interests, unhinged by the burden of pleasing one or the other neighbor, India will become realistic in dealing with Nepal. Then Nepal and India can look at the border dispute or any other dispute in the light of their own merits and will be able to solve them in the best interests of the two countries. It’s then the history and evidence of the boundary dispute will come into play.
History and Evidence 
The 1816 Sugauli Treaty between Nepal and East India Company determined Nepal’s present day eastern and western borders with India. In the east, the Mechi River serves as the Nepal-India border. In the West, the Mahakali or the Kali River plays the same role.
It’s the origin of the Mahakali River that is in dispute today and is complicating things. This complication again dates back to the time of the British India.
The maps produced by the British India in the 1820s, after the Sugauli Treaty, identifies Limpiyadhura as the origin of the Kali River. Any land East of the Kali belonged to Nepal and to its West belonged to India.
Several decades later, some of the maps produced by the East India Company in the 1860s started showing a relatively small river emerging from Lipu Lekh as the Kali River. But then there are maps of Garhwal and Kumaon regions from that era those still show Kali River originating from Limpyadhura as the boundary river between the two countries. Nepal has collection of those maps.
Perhaps oblivious to this new map issued by the East India Company, Nepal continued to assert her sovereignty over the area east of the Kali River that originates from Limpiyadhura. And neither the British India nor the Independent India staked claim to any area east of the Kali River. There are evidence that people living in this part of the land were included in the census conducted by the Nepali state, they took part in the first parliamentary elections of Nepal in 1959 and local elections three years later. The government records show they owned land registration certificates issued by Nepal.
Things, however, changed after the 1962 Sino-Indian War. Since then an Indian Army post has been stationed at Kalapani. There are two theories about when India did set up the military post there.
Following the end of the 104-year Rana oligarchy in Nepal in 1952, New Delhi convinced Nepal to establish 18 temporary military posts along her northern border under the pretext of the imminent threats from the Communist China. Since China had annexed Tibet in 1949 the threat seemed real to Kathmandu.
Nepal, therefore, conceded to the Indian demand on June 9, 1952. What were supposed to be temporary posts turned out to be permanent ones; the Indian Army showed no sign of leaving Nepal’s northern frontier long after the end of the Sino-Indian war.
Hosting the Indian army for 18 years along her northern border, Nepal finally sent them packing in August 1970.
One theory is that, only 17 posts were removed and one was allowed to remain in the Kalapani region at India’s request, given its security concerns about China following the war.
The other theory is more plausible. The military post at Kalapani was different from the 18 posts stationed along the Nepal-China border in 1952. 
In the build-up to the 1962 Sino-Indian war, the Uttar Pradesh Armed Constabulary established its post in the Kalapani region. It is assumed that it was done with verbal consent of King Mahendra. It was soon replaced by the Indian Army post. Although India agreed to withdraw the 18 military posts stationed along Nepal-China border in 1970, the Kalapani post continued to remain there. The king had told his ministers that he had given permission for a temporary post and it would be removed in due course. The king perhaps relented to Indian demand to station a military post in Kalapani to assuage Indian Prime Minister Jawahar Lal Nehru, who had sent a personal letter to King Mahendra urging him to restore multiparty democracy and release jailed leaders, following the 1960 royal coup. Since then the post has remained there. Gradually, the military post started to cut off Kalapani-Limpiyadhura region from the rest of Nepal.
It is for this reason Nepal has evidence of asserting its sovereignty over the Kalapani region only until 1960. After that Nepal has evidence of scant connections and communications with her own people.
The role of the media
As the tensions grow, we in the mainstream media in India and Nepal, must emphasize on dialogue and peaceful settlement.
We should press our respective governments to bring historical evidence to the table and negotiate in earnest.
I would like to request friends in the Indian media—those who I know personally and those I trust to use their best judgment—not to allow the public discourse on this issue be overtaken by jingoism and short-term narrow interest that will harm our centuries-old friendship.
There is no reason why the two countries, which share civilizational linkages and have a unique relationship, cannot resolve this amicably.
We are aware that Nepal needs India perhaps more than India needs Nepal. Our economy is intricately linked to the Indian economy more than any other economy in the world. And our relationship with India will have a large sway in our future prosperity. Alternately, flaring of tensions with India will have ramifications for the families living on the edge of the economy.
As much we acknowledge this, the Indian intelligentsia will also do well to realize that India needs Nepal too. An aspiring regional power, India cannot be without friends in her immediate neighborhood. Despite the current boundary tension, India and Nepal have a good chance of solving it and retaining their friendship unique to South Asia.
Sometimes, India takes this friendship for granted and uses economic leverages to settle differences, as it did during the 2015-16 economic-blockade imposed in Nepal.
As much as Nepalis value friendship with India, they also zealously guard their self-respect and independence. That’s why they showed resolve and unity in facing the hardship caused by the months-long economic blockade.
In imposing the economic blockade, India failed to read the Nepalis and the Indian media, by and large, failed to report the event and the Nepali sentiment.
I just hope this time around, the Indian government understands Nepal’s genuine interest to settle the border dispute in the Kalapani region in the light of historical evidence and my friends in the Indian media will give a fair and nuanced coverage on the issue.

It is commendable that the committee awarding the 2020 Pulitzer Prize for journalism, the most prestigious recognition in the field, has decided to award the staff of The Washington Post in the Explanatory Reporting category for their writings on the effects of extreme temperature on the planet.
Unfortunately, I would say, there is no better time to think about climate change than now with the pandemic we are going through.
Though there is so far no scientific evidence linking the COVID-19 outbreak with climate change, there is an undeniable mountain of scientific facts showing how rising temperature could bring not only devastating natural calamities but also public health emergencies.
The link between climate change and public health is undisputable.
The dengue outbreak last year in the Kathmandu Valley was induced by the fact that mosquitoes are forced, due to higher temperatures, to migrate toward cooler climate, like hills and mountains.
The number of casualties during the dengue outbreak was low and no one really was overly concerned about it.
A bit like if COVID-19 would have remained just a “Chinese” problem.
Perhaps in a post-COVID-19 era, people will start to take notice of the next mosquito induced outbreak in the Valley.
We all know that Nepal is one of the most climate vulnerable countries in the world.
Citizens are aware of it and yet does a mass consciousness of the problem exist?
Are citizens being sensitized and made aware of the calamities that might upend their lives in such a way that would lead them to take actions for a more sustainable future?
If you live in an urban area, especially within the Kathmandu Valley, you are aware that air pollution takes a toll on your health.
While it might not count too much on the global gas emissions, definitely air pollution defines, for the worst, the way you breathe. And it’s bad!!!
Before the lockdown, were there any actions for better air being driven by citizens?
Globally you can see some leadership recently in matter of climate change: amid the COVID-19 pandemic, world leaders had time to think about climate change.
Under the auspices of Germany, the Petersberg Climate Dialogue from 27 to 28 April offered a new opportunity not to lose track on the global commitment to fight climate change.
Are we entirely sure that is only up to the leaders to address climate change?
What are the responsibilities of the citizens? What’s about our common leadership?
Many are attempting to forecast how the future will be after the COVID-19.
Those most hopeful are imagining a rebooting of the global order with a more inclusive, just and sustainable globalization.
Surely a post-epidemic era should be centered on citizens’ activism and more conscious decision making.
Activism will imply stronger forms of community organizing to keep the governments at all levels more accountable and compliant with the international obligations in matter of sustainable development and fight against climate change.
For a country like Nepal, the citizenry will have a chance to help the new federal model work from the ground.
Engaging local governments in the most pressing issues will help create new forms of civic engagement that “naturally” must be tuned toward eco-sustainability practices.
Each single project, including the smallest ones, being planned locally, should include an environmental audit where citizens are enabled to be in charge.
Community organizing means also for citizens to come up with their own small scale projects, for example, a sustainable tree plantation or small scale renewable plans.
In these cases, the local governments should not become a hindrance, a red tape nightmare but rather facilitators and enablers.
Local schools, now under the purview of the local governments, should be turned into linchpin for a new environmental consciousness.
Starting from the teachers, local administrations could identify local champions among them, recognizing and awarding those educators who are particularly keen to work on creating new level of consciousness in matter of environment, climate change and social justice.
Each teacher, even the less engaging and enthusiastic, should be persuaded to try to embed a new environmental consciousness in their lesson plans.
They should do it out of their sheer survival instincts because their future will depend on how their current students will take decisions in a few years to come.
Extra-curricular classes could be run in order to talk about sustainability and environment.
Each student could make a personal pledge, for example, not throwing any plastic, including the candies' wrap, on the ground, something very common right now, even among adults.
In the month of April, a series of events should be organized by students leading to a main celebration to be held on the 22nd, Earth Day.
The provincial and federal governments could put resources, also from donors’ money, to invest in local so-called mini “new green deals”, local strategies to chart the future development of local communities, putting environment, equity and gender empowerment at the front.
Moreover a much bigger effort should be made to involve citizens in the key strategic planning of the country.
Singapore, despite being very hierarchical and top down, is attempting at engaging citizens to design its future.
Envisioning Nepal in 2030 should become a mass exercise, an exercise of true nation building where everybody can contribute with ideas and suggestions.
For example, in the past, documents like the Sustainable Development Goals, Status and Roadmap: 2016–2030 were surely written after broad consultations but perhaps we should ask ourselves how far, to what extent, such consultations went.
How many citizens from remote and inaccessible areas were involved?
How many school children were actively engaged in the discussions?
Probably none.
A post-pandemic world could lead to rethinking of the role of citizenry in the way we are governed.
Ideally we should have more direct democracy, more power on the people’s hands, partially replacing representative democracy though this might imply certain difficult trade-offs to make.
Much simpler and immediate would be encouraging higher levels of civic engagement.
Instead of having just a few eco-warriors striking on the streets, we should have entire communities engaged and involved not only in lobbying and advocacy but also in taking the lead on “greener” decision making.
The governments at central and local levels should do their utmost efforts, for example, in giving a voice to the citizens in reviewing the national climate action plan, formally the National Determined Contribution (NDC) that Nepal prepared back in 2016.
This would give them a sense of agency, motivating them and embedding in them the urgency for a change in the way they think and conduct our lives.
In short, all of us should “do” and “promote” those not so abstract Sustainable Development Goals, SDGs.
We are all responsible to get out of our comfort zones, change our habits and promote better practices and change the way the government works.
This might be the new governance imperative in a post COVID-19: more and better citizenship engagement.

India by inaugurating the link road to Mansarovar of China through Nepali territory of Lipu Lekh on Friday has betrayed the centuries old friendship between the two countries. The fact that India inaugurated the road in complete disregard to the last understanding between the two countries to resolve the dispute through dialogue has once again exposed India's hegemonic tendency towards her neighbors. 
The government was prompt in its response. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement the next day expressing regret over the unilateral construction and urged India to refrain from carrying out any activity inside the territory of Nepal. It then summoned the Indian Ambassador to Nepal Vinay Mohan Kwatra on the first working day for both the countries after the Indian inauguration, and handed a diplomatic note conveying Nepal's position on the issue. Foreign Minister Pradeep Gyawali has also said that the government cannot wait for the end of the Pandemic for bilateral dialogue as suggested by the Indian side. 
The Sugauli Treaty (1816) states that all the territories east of Kali (Mahakali) River belong to Nepal clearly implying that the area including Limpiyadhura, Kalapani and Lipu Lekh lies in Nepal. The government has maintained that Nepal conducted a census in Kalapani area in 2018 BS and also has historical evidence of Nepal collecting tax from the surrounding areas in the past.
It is high time that the government made those and other evidence public. Hopefully, the international media, including the Indian media, will pick the issue in light of the evidence. The international community will take note of how the largest democracy and an aspiring Superpower is blatantly encroaching territories of a small and friendly neighbor. 
The then Sushil Koirala government had expressed its disagreement in 2015 through separate diplomatic notes addressed to both India and China when the two sides agreed to include Lipu Lekh Pass as a bilateral trade route without Nepal’s consent. The area is a tri-junction between Nepal, India and China, and the government should again raise the issue with China reminding that note. The government should engage China at the earliest on the issue and request that the northern friendly neighbor deny access of the recently inaugurated link road to the Chinese side until India resolves the issue with Nepal amicably.  
At the same time, Nepal should also pursue diplomatic communications with India. Foreign secretary level dialogue is the mechanism agreed by both the countries to resolve the border disputes. So far India has not shown any interest despite Nepal twice proposing the dates for holding the meeting since the border issues were exacerbated after India published its political map including the Nepali territory of Kalapani, Limpiyadhura and Lipu Lekh in November 2019. The government should call for an immediate foreign secretary level meeting or talks at the level of foreign ministers or even prime ministers. 
The government should clearly tell India, and even China, its willingness to take the issue to the United Nations (UN) if India again dawdles, and China becomes complicit in the encroachment by allowing access to the newly inaugurated Indian link road. Nepal has always believed in maintaining close and friendly ties with both India and China. We are still committed to our shared future and look forward to deepening ties with both the neighbors. At the time, we are also committed to defending our sovereignty and territorial integrity. In no circumstance, we will be ready to compromise and cede any piece of our land.

The government has announced that a decision has not yet been taken about when the Secondary Education Examination (SEE) will be held this year. However, in a recent interview the Minister for Education, Science and Technology Giriraj Mani Pokharel expressed concern about the possible breakdown of the academic calendar due to COVID-19 and stated his desire to schedule the SEE for the middle of June. We need to give serious thought to whether this rescheduling is in the best interest of the 482,219 young people involved.
To begin with, it would have been good not to mention a date, amidst current uncertainties about how the pandemic will affect the country. But more importantly, this lockdown is an opportunity to rethink the very idea of the SEE, which was introduced in place of the tried-and-tested School Leaving Certificate (SLC) in 2017. There are many things that need to be done in order to improve the quality of education for children in Nepal, and the cancellation of the SEE is one of them. While this was a fact even before COVID-19, the pandemic and lockdown have provided us with the opportunity to think outside the box and to push for positive change.
The logistics of exams
 Minister Pokharel’s suggestions regarding the logistics of holding the examinations are unrealistic. He suggests two specific changes in the administration of the exams. The first is to have the examination centers placed within walking distance of the students’ homes, and the second is to conduct exams in three shifts each day.
With regard to creating examination centers within walking distance, we have to keep in mind that students from all over the country, whether they attend public or private schools, will be taking this exam. Is the government thinking of home centers only in certain districts or all over the country? Who will be responsible for making this arrangement? The municipalities, wards, or schools? What kind of financial and human resources will be required, and what is the time frame within which the job must be completed? The logistics seem vast and complicated, and one wonders if serious thought has been given to these matters by the ministry.
The proposition to have three exams per day also has to be studied well. Each exam runs for three hours. It is said that the students will eat at home before coming to the exam center. This means that they will be at the centers for 11 hours (three three-hour exams and two one-hour breaks in between). Such an arrangement will be nothing less than torturous for these students.
How do the professionals at the Ministry of Education expect students to be ready to give exams in three different subjects every day? And how will they write in a focused manner for nine long hours? What is the benefit to the students in doing this?
Minister Pokharel says in the interview: “The ministry is working out a system by which the upcoming academic year will not be affected.” He says that if the exams are held by the middle of June (end of Jeth), and if the results are out in a month instead of the over two months it generally takes, if the summer and winter holidays are cancelled, if festival holidays are not given, and if extra classes are conducted, then the next academic year could be saved.
We have to accept that the pandemic has already disrupted the academic calendar the world over. Our decisions should be made taking this into consideration instead of being in denial of this fact. Furthermore, we must ask, given the nature of the SEE, if this misery inflicted on millions of children, guardians and educators at all worth it? What is the benefit in going ahead as the ministry plans?
The postponement of SEE
The Secondary Education Examination (SEE) was scheduled for March 19 to 30, and was postponed the evening before the start. Altogether 482,219 students were sitting for the SEE this academic year in 1,995 examination centers across the country. While the government had already enforced limits on travel, placed strictures on the number of people gathering (25), and mandated schools and colleges to close, it was still hoping to conduct the SEE because, according the ministry, “any delay could hamper the academic calendar”.
The decision to postpone the SEE examinations was made on the eve of their start, by which time tens of thousands of students who were not local residents had already travelled to exam centers and paid for room and board for the duration of the exams. However, we should not jump to criticism of this decision, because there was no knowing at the time what the best mode of action would be. The novel coronavirus pandemic was just unfolding in Nepal and the South Asian region as a whole, with very few cases of infection, and the ministry was understandably tempted to complete the exams. However, in the end it erred on the side of caution and this was a good decision.
Why SEE must be annulled
The government’s apparent plans to conduct the SEE two weeks after the lockdown is lifted need to be revised for the following reasons.
First, let us understand the nature of the SEE. This examination system is new to Nepal, having replaced the School Leaving Certificate (SLC) examination in 2017. According to the government, the difference between the SLC and the SEE is that while the former was based on numerical marks, the latter is a letter-graded system. However, the true difference between the two examinations is that the SEE has been designed to allow the maximum number of students to pass.
In the past academic year, 460,000 students sat for the SEE, and only 1.8 percent scored below ‘D’and thus were considered unsuccessful. The rest, over 98%, passed. This is in stark contrast to the average 42% pass rate under the SLC exam system. If the intention behind conducting the SEE for this year’s tenth graders is to identify students with weak academics, this goal will not be met, because nearly all students pass the SEE.
The second point to consider is that school education for Nepal, as recommended by the School Sector Reform Plan (SSRP)and adopted by the government, is completed in Grade 12 (basic education is Grade 1-8, and high school is Grades 9-12).Therefore SEE is not a ‘school-leaving’ test that certifies a student’s capacity to move from the school to the college level. In the main, SEE is meant as a screening tool for students going from Grade 10 to Grade 11 within the same school. Its significance as a nationwide examination does not compare to that of the SLC that preceded it. Even that significance is diminished by the fact that next to everyone passes.
When we look at these facts, it becomes clear that for the past few years the government has been expending vast amounts of time, energy, and resources for something of very little consequence. While we should have studied the appropriateness of the SEE anyway, the COVID-19 crisis has forced us to sit up and take notice. Several individuals and institutions are now doing so, such as the Ganesh Man Singh Adhyayan Pratishthaan, which has recommended the cancellation of the SEE exams.
To reiterate, under the current system, school-leaving is after the 12th grade, and there is little need for the National Examinations Board (NEB) to conduct SEE to simply ensure movement from Grade 10 to Grade 11.The NEBcan focus on holding the 12th grade examinations well and can do away with examinations in Grades 10 and 11. In the meantime, the government must start a public information campaign to ensure that there is full understanding among the public that Grade 12 – not Grade 10 – is the end point of school education. This should be done not merely as a recommendation to students, but as a declaration of what the current schooling system is.
Trust the schools
 The removal of the SEE is also an opportunity to have schools to do their own evaluation of students at the end of tenth grade. In the past, the government (as well as larger society) has been worried that letting schools conduct the examinations will result in cheating and this fear has necessitated the tremendous resources required for centrally administered examinations. Given that centralized examinations should now be reserved for Grade 12, there will be little lost – and a lot to be gained – by allowing schools, both public and private, to provide their own evaluations to students. This will be an opportunity for schools to engage in real teaching instead of merely teaching for the test.
Thus, teachers would assess their students’ performances throughout the year to provide letter grades for their students: Distinctions, A’s, B’s, C’s, etcetera. This is an opportunity to make schools more accountable and honest in grading, because the grading will be meant for students who continue within the institutions themselves. Over time, those schools that are too lenient in their markings will be ‘found out’ when students finally graduate in Grade 12, hence there will be an incentive to provide authentic evaluation of students throughout the school years.
The question may arise as to what can be done with students who study only until Grade 10. First, the government must try and ensure that henceforth all students end their schooling in Grade 12, because in terms of maturity as well as in terms of job prospects, to study until this grade is important. However, in the event that for whatever personal, financial or livelihood reason a student does end schooling in Grade 10, the National Examination Board must certify the grades provided by the individual schools. For these students, the government must also invest in vocational education.
Schools know their students best, and this will be an opportune moment for the ministry to work on the basis of trust and have them send the marks for the tenth-grade certificate.As they get used to the new system, schools will have the confidence to send authentic grades because they have taken care of these students over many years. The government can use a general guide based on schools’ exam records of the previous years in order to examine authenticity.
Just as the schools upgrade students from Grades 1 through 9 each year, they should be able to upgrade them from Grade 10 to 11. The practice of continuous assessment on a daily basis, if done well, will give teachers much better information on the students’overall strengths than a one-time final examination. It is, therefore, not advisable to give too much importance to the SEE.
Consider the situation in which a student leaving Grade 10 in one high school wants to enroll in another high school’s Grade 11. In such cases, the student will have to sit for the entrance examination of the school into which he/she is seeking admission.
Providing a better learning environment
If schools are given the opportunity to evaluate their own students, they can evaluate them on a broad range of capacities. This will be a much more holistic evaluation than the present three-hour subject exam that tests primarily content rather than skills. It will encourage teachers to start taking their jobs more seriously and to provide individual oversight to each child, figuring out what they have leant and where they need further support. Students will learn to nurture a multitude of skills and interests rather than focusing on passing an examination. The present trend of cheating to pass the exams would be made redundant and each school would know the strengths of the students much better.
With students and teachers both being asked to be honest about their work, we will be grooming citizens who are upright and honest about what they know and where they need help. The ministry, for its part, can make effective use of the National Assessment for Student Achievement (NASA) and Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) to gather information on how each school fares within the country, and how our student performance compares internationally. It can focus on providing training on how to empower teachers, school leaders, parents and students themselves on the importance of honest and sincere work.
In conclusion, the ministry must take a serious look into the matter of the SEE. If the International Baccalaureate and the Cambridge International Examinations can do this for schools all over the world, Nepal can surely trust its own schools. All educators know that it is trust itself that inculcates honesty. This is the time to set an example and take bold decisions considering what benefits the students the most.  This is, therefore, an opportunity to do away with the SEE not just for this year, but for good. This decision would be part of the long-haul campaign ahead of us to improve schooling in Nepal so that our children can have the bright future they deserve.

It is imperative that transportation enthusiasts take some time during the COVID-19 pandemic to rethink our normal way of imagining urban transportation system. In our society, the idea of travel being a derived demand has been consolidated by the crisis which has forced us to stay in. The recent works on maintenance of the roads is admirable but what the article premises on is the demand side and the externalities of transportation which involves human interaction.
We perceive our transportation system as roads on which vehicles move along with humans interacting with the infrastructure and among themselves. What we see down there is traffic, sometimes easy and smooth, while at times horribly frustrating. However, what we experience on our roads is actually the result of our urban form that creates the need of travel and the choices we make in regards to our need of travel. The pertinent questions we ought to be looking for with regards to our transportation system are: WHY WE TRAVEL? HOW WE TRAVEL? And finally, WHEN WE TRAVEL?
Deeper inquiry into these questions will make us come up to the idea that the composition, variation and fluctuation of the traffic that our infrastructure has to cater is actually the externality of how we collectively respond to the questions above in our daily lives in accordance to our circumstances.
This time of lockdown has provided us enough time to reflect on these ideas that transportation is not just roads but the way people interact or are induced to interact with it. Since, this is quite tricky, as each individual in a society varies in terms of choices, social and economic background, this area has not been adequately looked into. Trying to understand the answer to the aforementioned three questions would help us take interventions that could not only ameliorate the conditions of our traffic but make long-term changes to the pivot of our transportation system.
For instance, Netherlands which is today known as the cycling capital of the world was moving toward car-based transportation in the 1950s and the 1960s but an oil crisis in 1973 helped them rethink that probably cars dominating the roads would not be in their best interest and they took steps that helped them orient their mobility around people while having a thriving economy.  We can only imagine what the authorities might have had to go through while they were imagining the transportation system that was completely different to the trend of that period. Today, it is a great success story.
The externalities of our traffic system like congestion, traffic crashes or pollution is something we would be happy to get rid of.  Since the traffic that we see on the roads are actually externalities of our needs of travel and our choices, intervening on the traffic operations are essential but may not prove to be relevant in long-term planning. For instance, congestion which we often view as a problem of our infrastructure being unable to cope with the demand could have solutions in socio-cultural modifications pertaining to our work. The work from home concept, which many managers today are forced to resort to, could be considered as a new normal for a variety of jobs even after lockdowns are lifted. Comprehensive  studies on employee-based demand management strategies for different working sectors could be conducted in the urban areas so as to flatten  the office hours in such a way that the infrastructure that we have shall be able to cope with the demands. It is almost analogous to flattening the curve, as we speak in COVID-19 jargon, so that the traffic demand could be coped at all times of the day if we have to talk in contemporary terms. For instance, Safe and Sustainable Travel Nepal (SSTN) is an organization working on the research of various areas of transportation system and it provides weekends to its research interns on other days than on Saturdays.  One recent practice that we have come up with that directly affects our transportation network is the change in school times that was implemented a couple of years ago. A change of even 15 minutes could significantly attenuate the peak demand.  
Another important area that is very important is the issue of equity. Has our transportation system today provided the ease of movement equally to people of different age groups,  different socio-economic background or people who are differently abled? Our society though relatively young today, would start ageing and if we do not consider our senior citizens in our planning process today, this might force us to again rethink our transportation infrastructure later. By not planning our mobility for differently abled people, we would restrict their mobility which could directly impact their economic well-being.
Additionally, one aspect that could directly affect the well-being of the people living in urban areas is their degree of mobility and how much they can gain from their degree of mobility. There is no doubt that there is no such thing as perfect equity and the alternative transportation system that we imagine might also not be perfectly equitable but it would not be an exaggeration to state that our current transportation system benefits those who own a private vehicle than those who do not. As a result, those who do not own a private vehicle are enticed toward owning one which takes us toward a vicious cycle of our infrastructure supply not being able to handle the demand over a period of time. Furthermore, the ones using motorbikes are at a much greater risk of crashes and a system that induces individuals to resort to such precarious choices pertaining to our travel needs is not something we should remain complacent about.
Moreover, having a spatial system that hurts the well-being of people who do not own a private mode of transportation is not what we should run after as a society. The current crisis also shows that changing the work culture and alleviating the need of travel unless absolutely necessary would heavily reduce our dependence on cars/motorbikes.  Mass-transit is an excellent solution to provide economic mobility but various factors pertaining to its operation, specifically lack of reliability has kept in from being an attractive mode of travel in most urban areas. As a matter of fact, we as a society might be moving toward a stage where we consider having private automobiles as a representation of affluence, by default, and a stereotype of public transit as something for the poor. Former mayor of the Colombian city Bogota, Gustavo Petro, wisely reminds us that “A developed country is not a place where the poor have cars. Its where the rich use public transportation.” 
Any discussion on sustainable transportation will not result in strong outcome if it does not address the issue of urban form and vice-versa. As a matter of fact, our need of travel is largely determined by the arrangement of urban facilities.  The study of transportation of the Kathmandu Valley performed by the Japan International Co-operation Agency in 2011 shows that the Kathmandu Valley has the highest population density within the Ring Road and this region also attracts people from outside the Ring Road for employment opportunities. A robust public transportation within the Ring Road with integration of policies like park and ride or park and walk would be helpful to people across all the sectors. However, with regards to the developing urban areas there could be other ways of imagining urban form as well. Establishment of urban facilities like good schools, hospitals, malls and work places in those areas would curtail the need of travel to regions that are already attracting a lot of commute. This could be another way of urban form that would induce a completely different form of urban mobility.  It is important to note that every urban area is different in terms of its geography and the people living there and it would be in everyone’s interest to develop the urban form and our transportation system through participatory planning.
We do not yet know the concrete contextual form of our mobility system for our urban areas but most of us would agree that it has to be sustainable, as equitable as possible and should incorporate technological progress within itself. Raising an issue on changing our perception of transportation is one task but it will take a lot more steps than just acting directly on transportation. It includes interventions on spatial processes, human behavior, policies and technological development. A journey of thousand miles begins with a single step, goes a popular Chinese saying, and the time for taking the step could be now.

Governments and people around the world now are fighting against the newest threat to humanity. As with other disasters and emergencies, COVID-19 has differential impact on people who are affected disproportionately based on various intersecting factors such as gender, geography and socioeconomic status.
Students are among the hardest hit in the current pandemic. Many countries have imposed lockdowns causing schools and universities to remain closed. According to a UNESCO estimate, 1.7 billion students, or more than 90% of the world’s learners are forced to stay at home due to COVID-19 lockdowns across the globe. The government of Nepal enforced the nationwide lockdown starting March 24 further extending this until May 7. Schools and universities are closed and examinations are halted including Secondary Education Examinations (SEE) and grade 11 and 12 examinations. Over 35,000 schools are currently closed and over eight million students are staying at home. There is growing concern and confusion among teachers, parents and students over the future of education amidst the uncertainty resulting from the global pandemic.
Educational authorities are having rounds of discussions with educators and experts as to what should be the education modality to cope with the situation.  Some private schools have already opted to go digital and operate online classes. This has triggered a debate among the expert community suggesting how to take advantage of this opportunity to utilize technological advancements and bring schools to students’ homes through computers, mobile phones, tabs and other media. But some experts indicate the detrimental impacts online schools may have on the pre-existing digital divide in the country.
This decision by some of the private schools, although preparedness for online classes is questionable, has left parents particularly confused. Shanti Nepal who went back to her village with her sons in Kavre after the schools were closed, is now debating whether she should come back to Kathmandu, as her son’s school has decided to resume classes through online platforms. Other parents in her neighborhood were also notified by their children’s schools about online classes and some of them have returned to Kathmandu hiding in vegetable transporting vehicles disobeying the lockdown and risking the COVID-19 contagion. One man, who traveled back to Kathmandu with his family members hiding in a vegetable truck, shared that “I am worried that I may not be able to help my daughter as I lack knowledge and skills required to facilitate the online classes even though we have access to a computer and internet at home”. 
This exemplifies that even the parents and students of those having access to resources in cities are not fully prepared for and are in a dilemma regarding online classes.  The schools, teachers, parents and students of public schools in villages are in particularly difficult situations as many lack computers and internet. In light of insufficient preparation of educational stakeholders and a huge number of parents and students that do not possess resources required for digital education, the introduction of online classes may well worsen the digital divide.  Educational inequalities between well-resourced and under-resourced schools that have pre-existed in our education systems are also exacerbated. This further creates inequalities in the society.
The digital divide refers to the gap between people and regions that have access to modern information and communications technology, and those that don't or have restricted access. This technology can include telephones, televisions, personal computers and the internet. The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines a digital divide as “the economic, educational, and social inequalities between those who have computers and online access and those who do not”. The digital divide typically exists between those in cities and those in rural areas; between the educated and the uneducated; between socioeconomic groups; and, between the developed and developing nations globally. Even among populations with some access to technology, the digital divide can exist in the form of performance of computers and devices and speed or reliability internet connections.
According to the 2011 National Census, only 7.28% of households owned a computer and as little as 3.33% had household internet connection. Ownership of radio, television and mobile phones stood at 50.82%, 36.45% and 64.63% respectively. The Nepal Media Landscape Survey carried out by Sharecast Initiative Nepal in 2018 illustrates that ownership of radio sets and mobile phones has increased to 59% and 98% respectively. Similarly, the survey shows that 72 percent of households in Nepal own a TV set and nearly 60 percent of people watch television every day. While the ownership of these household amenities has increased dramatically since 2011, the disparity in the distribution of these resources between urban and rural areas, and across classes is still high.
The equipment and facilities online classes require surely are not affordable for many people even in the normal condition in countries like ours where 24.8% of the population is living under the poverty line, according to the Nepal Living Standards Survey 2010-11 considering people living under $1.25 per day poor. The purchasing power of many people in Nepal has been further reduced as many have lost their jobs due to the global pandemic and are finding it extremely difficult to provide for their families. Unavailability of the resources required for e-learning may leave out many children from the education system. Children out of school are most likely to be engaged in activities that are harmful to their social, physical and emotional development, e.g. become child laborers to help their parents financially.
Similarly, online classes may have detrimental impact on the existing educational inequalities especially between the students of public and private schools. Out of 29,000 public schools in Nepal, only 13% are equipped with computer labs and internet facilities. On the other hand, going to the schools that are technologically equipped also does not guarantee that the students possess this equipment at home. Therefore, making online classes inclusive and accessible particularly to poor families and those living in rural areas is an uphill climb that the education system needs to make.
Thinking constructively, the coronavirus crisis has also provided an unprecedented opportunity to redefine the education system. This calls for: 1) massive investment to increase access to a computer, internet and other equipment particularly among economically poor families; 2) carefully planned strategies in consultation with education experts and learning from the best practices around the globe; 3) well-coordinated context-specific efforts from education authorities and three tiers of government; 4) accessible and affordable services from telecommunication and internet service providers; 5) upgrading the technical know-how of teachers and incentivizing creativity and innovation; and 6) effective use of radio, television and telephones in distance learning.
Apart from delivering lectures, assignments and curricular contents,  e-learning classrooms and online platforms should be used more to help students to think critically, be creative, appreciate their surroundings and nature, learn life skills, provide psychosocial support and ensure mental well-being, and facilitate a smooth transition to “normal” schooling post-crisis.
This time should be taken as an opportunity to decide the face of future learning.  As the feeling of confusion dwells among education stakeholders, a new modality of education may easily get through and become familiar in a short time. Therefore, education authorities should introduce digital learning that will make sure that education does not have to wait until the pandemic is over. It will also ensure that students leap forward in different learning models which will bring them into a bigger pool of knowledge to survive in a digitalized world. In doing so, we need to ensure that the alternative modality of education will not amplify inequalities by putting under-resourced students at a greater disadvantage than those of wealthier families.

A recent infographic published by Kantipur showed that there were 192 suicides in the first 16 days of the coronavirus lockdown in Nepal. This is by far the highest cause of death during this period, while natural death is second with 88. These alarming numbers indicate the severity of mental health issues and suicide rates in Nepal. While most of the world believes in addressing mental health issues and has appropriate measures for their citizens who suffer from this, the situation in Nepal is just the opposite. Mental illness is a taboo here, and the victims are pushed to silently suffer by themselves. According to a report by the World Health Organization (WHO), Nepal sees 6,840 suicides annually, but insiders know the underlying issue is far greater than just the officially announced numbers.
This hidden pandemic is an unfortunate last result of a progressive worsening of a person’s mental wellbeing. It starts with signals anyone can relate to such as mental fatigue due to unfulfilled expectations or ambitions, anxiety, and chronic emotional and physical stress. It also all starts with the victim as well as their family. Neither do the victims talk about their mental health issues nor are those around them adequately engaged with them either because of lack of understanding or  for fear of societal stigmatization. They are often anxious about opening up due to the fear of being misjudged. They don’t feel comfortable opening up and sink deeper into despair and seclusion. Furthermore, their families might not be aware of the potential implications or consequences of living with a person with mental health issues. Even if they know this, they might not be able to take measures to help the victim because of public stigma, societal taboo, or simply lack of knowing how to respond. This dearth of communication and absence of support is the primary reason behind the worsening mental health of these individuals. This may build up to such an extent where they may commit suicide.
Seeking professional medical help is certainly a sensible decision to take for someone who is suffering mentally. This usually means visiting a psychiatrist in a country like Nepal that lacks a strong system for mental health and has shortage of counselors and psychologists. At the clinic, they have a conversation where the patient tries to present the problems they are facing mentally, emotionally, and even physically (e.g. headache). The psychiatrist tries to make the best judgment on how to help the patient, which primarily means medications. Most of the patients that visit a psychiatrist, even in their first visit, just end up walking out with a prescription.
 
If clinically approved medications were enough to help people get over mental illnesses, then why are there still so many suicide victims? The underlying reason is the lack of understanding, support and empathy that they are missing in their lives. Many of these people don’t have the intimate support of someone who could understand and empathize with what they are going through. That is why empathetic peer-to-peer communication is absolutely necessary to help people who are suffering mentally. We must develop an ecosystem of peer-to-peer communication, creating a supportive environment and community where people are comfortable to open up and talk with one another, sharing what they go through every day. It is paramount to give support and encouragement to people who are showing the initial symptoms of mental health distress and to those who are already experiencing more severe stages of mental health deterioration. Such effort should be complementary, on case-by-case basis, to the need of more advanced, professional help either in the form of psychologist or for more serious cases, the clinical support of a psychiatric.
To address this underlying issue, an online support group called Paaila was recently started to provide an easy-to-reach platform for anyone in need of mental health support. The mission of Paaila is to help people overcome their fears and encourage them to open up and seek help, and make people aware of the fact that feeling mentally unless, anxious, depressed or suicidal is not their fault at all. It is just an uncontrollable mental state that they are temporarily in. Platforms like Paaila give them compassionate and empathetic support, which many of them feel like they do not genuinely have.
In order to win the mental health battle, it is going to be essential to break traditional taboos embedded in our society, by educating the families and the loved ones of those experiencing all the forms of mental disorder, from the mildest to the most severe forms of it. Effective use of social media and any other digital platforms can help create a much needed new understanding of what it means to live with a mental health problem. Having peers helping and supporting each other can be an effective way to start addressing a different pandemic, one that often goes unnoticed until you read a gloomy headline about a mentally ill or suicide victim.Obviously a country like Nepal needs to put in place a strong system that detects and not ostracizes, that counsels and not judges, a system that can heal and not just “cure” all those citizens with mental health related conditions. Ultimately, it is okay not to be okay because, as Paaila believes, we can all replace 'I' with 'We' and even 'Illness' can become 'Wellness.’

Since the initial cases in Hubei of China, the number of confirmed Coronavirus (COVID-19) cases has grown rapidly and spread to countries across the world. And it is already declared a public  health emergency. As a result, many countries have taken several measures from mass testing, travel and border restrictions, to lockdowns in a bid to contain the virus. However, the risks and threats of the virus are still growing around the world. 
As countries across the world go into lockdown, many developing countries in particular face several problems of rapid response to this pandemic because of limited resources and weak public health system. In the countries where the pandemic is steadily progressing, there are emerging challenges of ensuring timely testing, treatment and robust contact tracing.
More worryingly, in most of the developing countries, many health workers do not have adequate access to personal protective equipment (PPE). Furthermore, there are limited hospital beds to accommodate the suspected and infected patients. Nonetheless, many health workers have shown an incredible commitment to provide health care services all the times in such difficult circumstances.  
Because of the increasing risks and spread of the pandemic, most of the central hospitals and laboratory facilities have mounting pressure for timely tests and treatment for all. Undoubtedly, the health systems in most countries would be obviously further overwhelmed to respond to the increasing needs for testing and treatment services. As a matter of fact, most of the hospitals and other health facilities do not have adequate testing and treatment facilities, and physical infrastructure.
In response to increasing spread of the virus, the World Health Organization is playing an important role in coordinating the global response and it needs to continue further for rapid response. Moreover, it is also high time that the countries and donors harnessed the power of partnerships in the fight against this pandemic. More importantly, more investment is critically needed to recapitalize health and epidemiological systems in the countries where health care systems are still weak and fragmented.
Of course, the increasing threats of the virus has prompted many governments to introduce unprecedented measures to contain the pandemic. Some of the pragmatic hygiene measures include frequent hand-washing, sneezing or coughing practices, and the use of protective facemasks. However, people living in poor, overcrowded, urban areas are especially vulnerable because most of them do not have adequate water and basic sanitation. And they could not even self-isolate, and have limited access to essential health care services.
It is good to note that the national governments and health authorities are periodically updating the situation of COVID -19 and calling all citizens to stay safe and in self-isolation. The widespread messages and global updates of the pandemic are also available in the social media.
Things looked different as the pandemic started to spread in Europe and the USA. According to Lancet, Asian countries, including China, South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan, have provided rapid and effective responses so far. This might be partly due to their recent experience with outbreaks of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2015 and the 2002–03 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic.
Despite some concerted efforts of prevention, the pandemic is likely to cause large-scale loss of life and human suffering. It is a big public health crisis which will further jeopardize global health transition and health systems across the low and middle income countries. Unfortunately, despite government's commitments to universal health coverage, the inequalities in health status  and unmet  needs  for health care still persist. In this context, one lingering question is: can the developing countries boost and optimize the capacity of health systems to respond to this pandemic?  
There are still lack of trained health workers in most developing countries. During any public health emergency or pandemic, health workers have to face additional pressure to provide timely health care services for people who are most affected and vulnerable. One of the serious concerns is to protect the health of health workers. That is why, ensuring availability of adequate face masks and other essential protective  equipment for all health workers is critical to avoid the risk of further infections.  
The consequences of this pandemic on our lives and communities are understandably worse than ever. Therefore, containment and mitigation strategies are key public health interventions to minimize the adverse consequences of the pandemic across the world. As we continue to fight this pandemic, the existing efforts to contain the virus should be further intensified to boost the health care systems and stabilize the economies. Additionally, the government urgently needs to plan stronger and more coordinated multi-sector response to mitigate its wider socio-economic impacts on individuals, families and communities.
Since the global health is in transition, the first and foremost priority of the national governments  is to invest more on building resilient and sustainable systems for health. One of the important priorities for health systems confronted with the spread of the pandemic is to protect the health rights of all people. This is only possible if the rapid diagnosis, testing  and  appropriate  health care  services are  readily  accessible, available and affordable  in  a  safe  environment at all levels.
To sum up, there are critical needs to mitigate the consequences of the pandemic across the world. Despite rapid population growth, increasing trends of migration and urbanization, there are still challenges and opportunities for achieving gains in health, particularly in the developing countries where poverty, gender inequality and poor health systems have been persistent over the decades. Therefore, a multi-pronged approach with strong containment and mitigation  actions, is urgently needed to effectively tackle the pandemic..

The coronavirus pandemic has completely engulfed the world. As of April 22, there have been over 2.5 million confirmed cases and almost 180,000 deaths worldwide with the United States now the epicenter of the crisis. The worldwide shutdowns necessary to contain the spread of the virus has been quite detrimental to the global economy. What is good for public health has been devastating for economies around the world. In the United States, about 17 million people, more than 10% of the labor force, filed for unemployment claims during the month of March. Canada shed more than one million jobs in March, which represents almost 5 per cent of country’s labor force. The statistics are unavailable for Nepal but if it were, it would be damning for the economy. Since there is no public provision for lost income in Nepal, there are no estimates to rely on to quantify the labor market effects of the economic shutdown.
Governments and central banks globally have unleashed fiscal and monetary rescue packages to mitigate the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic. The US recently approved a massive $2.2 trillion fiscal stimulus package along with trillions of dollars of injection of liquidity through unprecedented lending facilities through the Federal Reserve. The EuroZone recently agreed on half-a- trillion euros worth of rescue package for coronavirus-battered economies and is also mulling over another 3.2 trillion euros worth of additional packages. In India, the Narendra Modi government announced a 1.2 trillion rupee stimulus plan, including direct cash transfers and food security. According to the International Monetary Fund, countries around the world have taken fiscal actions amounting to about US$ 8 trillion along with unprecedented monetary and liquidity measures to keep their economies afloat during the crisis. All in all, the countries around the world are throwing the kitchen sink at the problem. The goal is to have a “V-shaped” economic recovery (rapid upturn after recession) once we get the pandemic under control as opposed to a “U-shaped” (longer recession before recovery) or an “L-shaped” recovery (severe recession and never recovering to previous growth rate). Nepal did come up with its own relief measures last month, which included discounts on household utilities like electricity and internet as well as extension of utility payment deadlines, temporary tax relief for hardest-hit sectors, and an announcement of in-kind food provisions to be administered through the local bodies.
One of the biggest concerns at the moment is how best to take care of the daily wage-earners. The government has been criticized heavily on delaying cash-transfers to daily wage earners, but it is encouraging to see the efforts from the local units in identifying the vulnerable groups and disbursing the funds. A lack of pre-existing data on them has certainly stalled the relief process, but we should use this opportunity to set up a national database for these groups by merging the data across the country. The government has requested them to register at their local bodies in order to get the benefits from the local government funds. But many workers are trapped in the city where they work making it inaccessible for them to those benefits when they need it the most.
An inability to pay rent is another significant hurdle for the daily wage earners. It is not rational to ask the landlords to waive rental payments for their hardest-hit tenants, and the government has already seen a backlash toward that end. The frustration is natural because rental income comprises a significant share of income for many landlords, and they may be counting on this source of income to cover their mortgage payments. Rather, the federal government could authorize local units to distribute means-tested vouchers for rent that the hardest-hit tenants could use to pay their rental income for the next three to six months. These vouchers would either be redeemed online, at their banks, or from the local bodies. The benefits are two folds. First, landlords would continue to get their rental income. Second, the local bodies can bring the rental incomes into the formal economy thereby enabling them to tax these incomes in the future. This can be a win-win situation for the government in the long run because this will lure the existing landlords to register their rental income and hence, the government can tax them when the economy recovers to normal state. It is also equally important that local bodies maintain the data of the vulnerable groups identified for the aid program so that it can be used as a criterion for other welfare programs in the future.
The relief measure is also silent on the issue of food security. The neighboring country is in complete shutdown for almost a month, and there is no end in sight soon. As the blockade a few years ago has laid bare the vulnerabilities of our economy, food crisis is not too far away. Farmers at home are having to waste milk, eggs, and other agricultural produce because of the imposed shutdowns. The government should step in and purchase these products to fill in the current void as well as redirect them in food banks and cold stores for use in the next few months. They are also unable to carry out their regular planting and harvesting. The government could also loosen up lockdown measures in the agricultural sector because planting and harvesting is time-sensitive. Losing a few weeks would mean losing the entire season’s yields.
The coordination of fiscal and monetary policies is ever more important during these times. The Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) has taken some steps toward that end. As per the NRB circular to banking and financial institutions dated 12/16/2075,  the Cash Reserve Requirement (CRR) has been reduced to 3%, and the interest rate on the Standing Liquidity Facility (SLF) rate has been reduced from six to five percent. Banks have been directed to defer interest and principal payments on all types of loans for three months and to offer a 10% rebate on timely payments. In addition, the NRB has raised the cap on the refinance facility to Rs 60 billion. Furthermore, there is a provision relaxing short-term countercyclical buffers. The NRB is no longer requiring banks to build up the two percent countercyclical capital buffer that was due in July 2020.
Countercyclical buffers are requirements for banks to maintain a higher capital-to-asset ratio during periods of economic expansion when banks are making high volumes of loans. These are in place to ensure that banks remain solvent if the value of the assets decline rapidly.
All of these steps are encouraging. However given the magnitude of the crisis we are in, the NRB should not shy away from taking some unprecedented steps. The NRB should consider further reductions in the SLF rate and CRR to inject more liquidity into the banking system. For example, the Reserve Bank of India exempted the CRR requirement for all retail loans back in February. We should consider doing the same here in Nepal and also relax other capital adequacy constraints for banks to unclog credit freezes in the economy.
The NRB has also directed Banks and Financial Institutions (BFIs) to approve short-term loan application from tourism and travel industry within five days if they had good credit standing before the crisis. However, the biggest concern at the moment is that banks may be unwilling to lend to these hardest-hit businesses which were otherwise healthy before the crisis. In order to mitigate this risk, NRB could start a facility akin to the Main Street Facility that the Federal Reserve in the US started on April 9. Under this proposed facility, troubled businesses could access loans from commercial banks, and commercial banks would then be able to sell a big fraction of the newly originated loans to the NRB conditioning on the borrowers having maintained solid credit standing before the crisis. This will enable the banks to continue lending without having to worry too much about the downside risks from the hardest-hit sectors. The NRB would create a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) and the Ministry of Finance would make equity investment to cover losses on these investments. The SPV will stop purchasing these loans from the eligible lenders at a certain date in the future once economic conditions improve. The NRB can also launch a Primary Corporate Credit Facility to purchase newly issued corporate bonds to provide financing alternatives for corporations during these difficult and uncertain times to the extent that corporations would be willing to issue new debentures.
Given the widespread slowdown of the global economy, remittance income is sure to fall in 2020 and possibly in 2021. This puts the foreign exchange reserve of the country  in a very precarious position. As of mid-February,  the foreign exchange reserves of the banking sector was only sufficient to cover the prospective merchandise imports of 9.7 months, and merchandise and services imports of 8.5 months according to the “Current Macroeconomic and Financial Situation of Nepal” report published by the central bank.  Much has changed in the world stage with the pandemic since mid-February. The price of crude oil has seen a record low, thanks to the worldwide fall in demand for oil compounded by the price war between the Saudis and Russia. The Saudis and Russia have since reached a truce but that has yet to prop up the price due to the very low demand. The oil dependent economies in the Middle East will crater in economic activity. Even the comparatively diversified Middle-eastern economies such as Dubai with a huge tourism sector will see a dramatic reduction in tourists until a vaccine is developed. The NRB has already imposed a temporary ban on import of luxury goods, but it is important to identify essential items from non-essential ones early on so that we prevent the drainage of foreign exchange reserves and protect our balance of payments position.
This crisis has clearly exposed the vulnerabilities of a remittance-driven economy such as ours. We should utilize this time thinking about how we can diversify our economy to improve resilience to different shocks.

The Nepal Academy has recently published photojournalist Bharat Bandhu Thapa's picture book 'Nepal in Pictures'.
The 320-page book includes over 500 photographs depicting tourism, arts, culture and society from Mechi in the east to Mahakli in the west and the height of Mt Everest to the lowlands of Kechanakaval. 
""My objective was to ensure that those who want to know Nepal get to see the main views and know the main specialties of the country in a single book. I was, therefore, working on it for a long time,"" Thapa tells Setopati. ""Nepal is such a big country that it is not possible to include the whole country in 320 pages. But I have tried to include different possibilities of the country as far as I know in this book.""
He added that the book will be polished further in the future. 
The pictures in the books depict places from Olangchung Gola in the east to Kalapani in the Far West, Khaptad, Badimalika, Upper Dolpo, Lumbini, Janaki Temple, Shukaphant to the culture of the Kathmandu Valley. ""Most of the pictures in the book have been clicked by me. But I have not travelled across the whole country. I was undecided about whether to include the places I have not visited or not,"" he reveals. ""I finally decided that those places should not be excluded from the book even if I have not visited.""
He has sought photos of those places from his friends and says that has prevented the book from being incomplete.

Congratulations, it's a baby girl!
The day an innocent soul descended to earth
Raised, free from all ruction of the world
Brainwashed to believe it’s a free world
But little did she know, the misfortune that a girl is destined for…
 
Like an angel from heaven she looked
Mature and clever she stood
The ambitious nature and optimism was captivating
But little did she know, she was destined for something devastating
 
Everything was going fine,
Until one day, when her father found a boy,
All that she knew about marriage was, dinner dates and soulmates
But little did she know, that her problems would now accelerate…
 
Now that she was getting bonded in a relationship as a wife
The sacred fire at her wedding was supposed to prosper her marital life
She was blissfully happy when she heard people say, one of the heaven made matches
But little did she know that the fire was burning all her dreams slowly and steadily into ashes
 
And now that she got married,
She stepped out to the world
She opened her eyes to see the truth about being a girl
Little did she know that her in-laws wouldn’t accept her the way she was
Taking care of them kept her free in no hours
 
She was married to a man, she'd never met before
No sooner did she give birth to a girl and nevermore
Her husband cared less, and the responsibility was bestowed all upon her
Burdened and pressured, she had to sacrifice her job
 
She was locked in the four walls
She kept thinking about her downfall
The window said--see the world
The clock said--time is precious
But all she could ever do was,
Sit there in a suffocating atmosphere, with her daughter bright and fair
 
Little did she know, that she would ever lie to her parents “everything is fine”
Who knew the darker side of the beautiful lie
 
She was financially dependent upon her husband after her loss of job
Her life was falling apart, as if it were some sort of plot
But when it came to self care, her husband didn’t even give a cense
She was made to believe the truths, such that it still benefitted the man on her expense
 
As years piled on her body in the form of pounds, cellulite and wrinkles
She started being insecure and her man wasn’t happy about how she appeared
Untold stories of defeat at hands of weighing scale
Looking at the mirror made her feel worthless and pale
 
Now that her daughter was growing into a mature girl
She finally had someone she could rely on
She found someone she could share her despise and cries
Until one day, when it was time for her daughter to face the real world
 
The mother didn’t want her child to leave
The child for whom she had faced everything, her only stream of hope and support
But in tears, she had to bid farewell to the only person with whom she had a good rapport
 
Little did she know, nothing is permanent and she would have to let go the person with whom she had her best moments…

Forests can simply be understood as complex ecosystems which is critical for maintaining healthy and habitable biosphere. Similarly, Water is another such critical component of the biosphere that is essential for the survival of all life forms. Traditionally, we understand that where there is forest, there is water. But in recent times, research has shown that this traditional understanding of interaction between forest and water is influenced by long-standing beliefs regarding the role of forest in water cycle and it is not always supported by science.
Various researchers have tried to explain the interaction between forest and water through years of empirical studies and they have come up with the following conclusions:

In a river basin, forest cover reduces the annual run-off compared to shorter vegetation. Dry season flow is likely to be reduced in forest catchments as tree roots extract water from deeper layers of soil.
Sometimes forest facilitates ground water recharge which temporarily allows for even distribution of run-off thus increasing dry season flow (but reduced annual flow). However, most evidence suggest reduction in dry season flow after afforestation.
Only in specific areas in the mountains, annual yields of water may increase because the forests intercept fog and cloud droplets.

This shows that availability of forest does not always support availability of water. Similar results were shown by a research in Nepal few years ago, which showed that pine forest has been one of the reasons for depleting natural streams and aquifers in the mid-hills of Nepal.
The forest area of Nepal is largely managed under the five forest management regimes as defined by the forest Act, 2076. Among these management regimes, community forestry is the most adopted forestry practice and today community forests occupy 28.8% of the total forest area of Nepal (Pathak et al., 2017). In the 80s, the government of Nepal started a country-wide reforestation initiative to recover Nepal’s mid-hills from wide spread deforestation that occurred a decade earlier. After years of research done by the Nepal Australia Forestry Project, pine was chosen as the ideal species for reforestation because it was already native in the mid-hills and grows very fast. As a result, majority of the trees in community forests of Nepal are pine today. But few years ago, a research in Dhulikhel showed that on an average pine consumes 13.5 liters of water per day and larger trees consume up to 70-80 liters of water per day. Also, they are coniferous evergreen species which means they require water throughout the year. This has caused reports of depletion of natural water sources from several districts of Nepal.
But the truth is there is not enough evidence to justify that pine is sole cause of depletion of water sources in the mid-hills of Nepal. Experts claim that because pine has very low utility in terms of fodder and fuelwood, it is less preferred by the local community that wants to replace it with species that are more suitable to their agricultural and household needs. Hence they report depletion of water sources due to pine trees. Also, there are natural pine forests in Nepal where water sources are flowing in a healthy manner. So, presence of pine does not necessarily cause depletion of water sources.
Perhaps, there are a number of other factors that may be playing a role in depleting the water sources in Nepal. Firstly, the management practices that are being adopted for managing forests are not focused toward maintaining ecological integrity of forest ecosystems. The scientific forest management system which is solely focused toward promoting growth and regeneration of timber species are being adopted in high altitude districts like Humla, Baitadi and Parbat, which will only degrade the ecosystem integrity further. This surely has a certain degree of impact on the availability of water in the natural springs. Another factor that is at play here is climate change. With disruption in weather patterns, erratic rainfalls have become common around the world. Some places experience concentrated rainfalls, whereas some places experience droughts. This may have also caused depletion of water in the natural streams and aquifers.
All we can say for now is that more research needs to be done to understand the dynamics of relationship between forest and water. Government institutions like Forest Research and Training Center (FRTC) and other non-governmental institutions working in the field of forestry need to collaborate in long-term research projects to ascertain whether the depletion of water resources is being caused by pine or not. If pine is really causing depletion of water resources, they can be replaced with species such as chilaune or katus or others that are suitable to the local factors. Also, proper policies need to be designed and adopted at the provincial level to integrate forest and watershed management for sustainable utilization of Nepal’s natural resources. The ways to rejuvenate these natural springs and aquifers also need to be explored to maintain long-term availability of water in our rivers.

As the coronavirus pandemic hit, the government issued a fiat ordering a stringent lockdown. The roads and sidewalks were emptied, the shops shuttered, and the phalanx of police guarded the junctions from casual strolling and nonessential driving. The scheduled programs, seminars, meetings and appointments were indefinitely deferred. People went cloistered inside the four walls of their homes or the rented rooms, listening to radios, watching televisions or mindlessly scrolling the algorithms. The opportunity to spend free time with the family members, after a long time, evolved as a response to the fear of a death-dealing virus presumably spreading in the public sphere. The home, which was in constant interaction with the public, and where it drew its essence from, gradually showed how it could turn sour from sweet from the harshness of its own sheer domesticity. In contradistinction to an initial assumption that lockdown would free us from the unfree labor conditions of the public working places, and we would be able to pass time by a relentless and reckless exploration of our hobbies, we soon started to pine for the same old routines. The social media provided avenues and practically advised on how we should approach our hobbies, which books we should pore over, which movies we should watch, and what DIYs we should get our hands on. The middle class cyberspace displayed accordingly its exploits--exotic, elaborate vittles and crafts, as an unintended affront to the precariats who were on the verge of hunger. As philosopher Theodor Adorno defines boredom in Free Time as “the function of [social] life which is lived under the compulsion to work, and under strict division of labor”, excitement flagged too soon, and boredom reigned in. The boredom, and the anxiety it brought, forced people to return back to the reified labor regime through computerized work-from-home mode, and to a compelling engagement in micro-discourses of the social networking sites with a fair degree of petulance and irascibility. Chaos, and the ineptitude of the authorities to take exact measures to curb the spread of the virus, spurred the gentrified protests of the urban youths whose age and vigor entails them to peregrinate over places pretty much like the virus itself. It seemed staying in and staying out of the houses for the longer periods were both menacing--only a delicately balanced shuttle between the two appeared to be salubrious. Objectively, the financialization of capital, and the neoliberal paradigm that can’t sustain savings for a few months, and is reluctant to provide “basic goods” during the crises even for the relief of indigent families, and subjectively, the associated aspiration of people to meet quantitatively set “productive” goals got disrupted by the lockdown. As days, weeks and months passed in the passivity of countless scrolls, we witnessed a surge in publicization of a form of face-to-face interaction in the social media--the zoom, first as an anodyne for boredom, and second as a compulsion for performance based work-plans.  
Even though cognizant of the fact that there is cornucopia of video conferencing platforms on the internet, I first came to know about the specific brand and its service through the talk programs aired on YouTube, and saw how it sneaked into the individual private spaces of the guests, and diverged those images to the public. The zoom webinars, a portmanteau of web and seminar, soon became a vogue phrase of the professionals--sharing screenshots of combos in the social sites, and receiving applauds for the same. As the zoom screenshots grew profusely, I secretly wanted to get a role in one of those. Eventually, I participated in a handful of webinars with excitement until the point of time it seemed too trite.
I was first invited to zoom by a batch of senior sociologists to listen to a series of talks on the prefatory remarks on the effects of coronavirus pandemic. Sociologists, much like other academicians, are active in documenting social lives, churning out papers, and disseminating information through seminars as a ritual. Currently off from teaching duties, academicians must have felt nostalgic about the “real” seminars, and must have felt an urge to disseminate their “productive” works, from the research conducted from home, to their colleagues and the wider public through live telecasts on Facebook.  As I opened the zoom for the very first time, it felt as if intruding in a Goffmanesque hall, reminiscent of the works of American sociologist Erving Goffman, where the participants precisely know how to coordinate a routine through a repertoire of behaviors. The men, all middle-aged, were greeting each other as if they were in a backstage of a seminar hall or during a recess until the clock struck when everybody toned down and silenced in ways to shift the ambiance to the front stage where only the formal talks are allowed. I had really put the room together, and had concealed the objects which were not allowed to the gaze of interlopers for a readiness to a situation if I had to open the video or accidentally did so. In quotidian seminars, academicians are generally called into a podium composite of table, pen, notepad and microphone where they give thoughts and give off expressions to the audience who are close to each other but socially distanced from the speaker. The metaphysical hierarchy is duly maintained. In zoom, however, participants are physically distanced, in the real sense, that they can even get a chance to get closer in a single frame. While the structure and props of regular seminars are institutionally fashioned, one has to cautiously “suppress” the pointless facts, and adjust the computer in a way that participants can see the professorial front of one’s space in an optimized angle, a rack of books, for example. It was of late that I came to know that zoom can obliterate your room altogether, and provide artificial backgrounds so that a person of certain status can feign one’s room according to the status and hobby--hackneyed bookrack concocted to a pair of oil-paintings or a guitar. Prior to knowing this specific feature, I was astonished by one participant who was going live from a pebbly seashore as the other sat in a baroque room. I don’t understand the degree of gratification one receives from these altered, synthetic backgrounds, but the technology has genuinely assisted to sequester the offstage into a working frontstage. While it is merely a fib on the part of who feigns his or her background, it is redolent of the general direction of human nature toward the impression management.        
The molecular details given off by the webinar participants, as they lecture on or listen to, specifically helps to glean information on the spaces which are often associated with traumas and anxieties, generally fenced off from the trait of confident forcefulness showcased in the public situations. Even though the entertaining but addictive social media has prompted public figures and academicians to post family photos and those of their fetishized possessions, as the camera zooms in, the face bulges out of the interior design and the architecture of the strictly private space. It is on the part of the audience to judge the aesthetics of a particular room whether it is spacious or crampy--to boast or regret is the duty of the speaker. The etiquettes and sartorial choices in the zoom webinars are either maintained as if the session had started at the midst of reading, writing or any of the “important” chores or as if one has been long preparing for the session which can be both casted as impressions projected toward the audience. Frustrating it may seem when the sound starts to crackle or the face goes blurry as the bandwidth decreases, a participant starts to talk on the phone or is summoned by a family member, calling forth a giggle or a shout.
In an academic system, everybody must be upbeat about the workings of the computer and information technology, and one should be able to process notes or prepare slides. As German philosopher Martin Heidegger states in “The Question Concerning Technology” that the “essence of technology is nothing technological”, the usage of the technology has been pragmatically employed in mundane scholarly activities far from being an end to itself. As the pandemic hit, the dependency to technology became more and more prominent and necessary for remote learning, for example. Technology, in broad, and the social sites, in particular, may have neutral features and objectives, yet they seem to strongly espouse, reinforce and circulate the unthought conservatism. One conspicuous example is of the manels of the web discussion series, where men boast of having specialized knowledge of a certain field, and end up passing the bromidic information. It is always the case for a discussion whenever its panel is homogenous, and the discussion is only more consequential if it incorporates diverse lived experiences and points of view. But, the real devil lies in the details--the social structure comes down to the molecular interactions -- micropolitics --of the social spaces. Academicians generally eschew the interactions altogether, and focus outwardly on the themes and structures which are themselves the consolidations of the interactions with which they themselves get involved. It is worth contemplating on the micro (mis)behaviors and conversational (dis)orders --littered with gaffes, aggressions, inequities--that gives keys to our social structure to which zoom becomes a rich ethnographic field.

Some goodbyes are harder than others and then there are some which you never want to say. This is one of those for me.
Since the very beginning of the pandemic, I controlled my movements, specially the gatherings. I even gave up attending funerals of my relatives and family friends.
Today after many months of confining myself inside, I could not hold back and attended my very first teacher’s funeral.
When I reached Pashupati Aryaghat to bid her my final farewell, the funeral pier was already lit. I started seeing so many familiar faces from Birgunj and her family. Maybe because of the continuous rain for the past few days, the firewood was wet and the area was covered by dense smoke. Amidst the smoke I tried to picture her, the last image of her that I had in my mind perhaps. A face with a smile and eyes full of life.
Every time I used to go to Birgunj and pass Himanchal Cabin, I tried to look who was sitting on the cash counter. If it was anyone else, I used to move on but if there was Mamta Ma’am sitting there, I would go and greet her. Lately she used to be busy with her social works including women empowerment so would not find her in that cash counter much. That was the reason why I wanted to go to the school with her. Never did I know that where I met her for the first time was going to be the place where we meet for the last time too.
People knew Mamta Rajkarnikar as an entrepreneur, a social worker, a gem of a person and for so many other generous engagements.
Mamata Ma’am was a member of the famous Himanchal Cabin family. It was the first proper sweet house that my home town Birgunj had. Some 70 years ago her grandfather Padam Rajkarnikar moved to Birgunj from Lalitpur and they introduced a variety of sweets in the tiny but growing town of Madhesh. Being Rajkarnikars of Kathmandu Valley they had a long legacy of sweets business.
But Mamata Ma’am was more than that for me. For me she was my first teacher, my first mentor and the person whom I adored and looked up to.
On 1st March 2019, I went back to my first school, Creche International School, after 18 years. As soon as I entered the gate of the school, nostalgia hit me. All those memories went through my head one after another like an episode of some series. That tunnel slide, that monkey bar, that playground and those classrooms; everything was a part of my childhood. Mamta Ma’am was smiling as she looked at me recollecting all those memories. I shared some of my memories with her, how I used to hide in that tunnel of the slide and cry as I did not want to come to the school, that one time when there was a magic show in the school, that one time when my grandfather brought ice-cream for the whole school on my birthday, that one time there was this photo shoot, that one time I was kept in the office and made to do my homework, those one times kept on rolling for a while. I kept on talking as ever and she was smiling and listening to everything that I was saying as ever.
To be honest, I was very scared of Mamta Ma’am when I was young. The reason behind it was my mother saying ‘I will tell Mamta Ma’am’ for every mistake that I made. Yet, as time passed by, I started to realize a lot of things and most importantly I realized that she is my first teacher and there is a special place for her in my life that no other teacher or mentor can ever have. Even after being principal and founder of Creche International School for 20 years, she was as cheerful and compassionate as ever. Her work ethics inspired me a lot. Talking about inspiration, there are a lot of things about Mamta Ma’am that had inspired me. Even the way how she bid her last farewell to all of us.
COVID-19 hit Birgunj very hard, as it was the gateway that connects Nepal to India. The coronavirus took many lives in that city and now it includes Mamta Ma’am, to add to her brother and her mother. After the government lifted the first lockdown in Birgunj, Rajkarnikar family was infected with the novel virus. After that she, along with her family members, was brought to Kathmandu. She lost her younger brother first, followed by her mother. And now after battling for more than three months at the ICU supported by the ventilator, she gave up. Her lungs were damaged beyond repair by the virus.
I cannot even imagine myself in the ICU and ventilator for all that time. Fighting the COVID-19 along with my mother and brother, losing both of them as they could not make it and still have that fighting spirit to recover from the damage it did to the body. She indeed died a HERO.
You may have left us but all your teachings, moral values and wisdom that you have passed down to us will keep you alive in every one of us. So, I am not going to say good bye to you Ma’am, I would rather like to thank you. Thank you for all those moral values and wisdom. Thank you for all the lessons of life that you have taught me. Thank you for being my first teacher. Thank you for listening to me so patiently. I could not have asked for a better first teacher than you. Thank you for everything Ma’am!

With increasing use of social media, the public communications disseminated by government authorities reach out to global readers. This means such communications have also come under unprecedented social media scrutiny. Social media users of Nepal have increasingly pinpointed typographical errors, generally referred to as typos, creeping into the public communications. Recently there have been several examples of negligence even on the part of academic institutions to live up to the writing standards and the objectives when it comes to typos. This article discusses consequences of some of the typos before summing up how typos in general also reflect the working environment in the public and academic offices, which is perceived to be getting laxer when it comes to compliance to writing contentions. 
The typo littered communications most disapproved and made fun of by social media users quite recently are more than funny and embarrassing. A reader cannot help chuckling upon going through the public service advertisement (PSA) published in Nepali language in a newspaper against trafficking in persons. The PSA reads “trafficking in person is our duty and intent.” By the purpose of the PSA, the typo has a disastrous result. A public notice displayed in a Hindu temple premises reads “we are in underground of seesee camera” to inform the visitors that they are under CCTV surveillance. You cannot help laughing them off. Similarly, a statement issued by the Public Transportation Office apologizing for service interruption due to electricity mistypes with an embarrassing result. The word written to refer to “link” is mistyped as something that refers to phallus in Nepali language.
A newspaper publishes a news report that reads that a “hospital safely impregnated a woman who tested positive for COVID-19” instead of reporting that the “hospital safely delivered a baby of a woman who tested positive for COVID-19."" When a ward office of the local government releases a public notice littered with boatload of random typos severely twisting the message meant to convey, it of course becomes a cause of concern. When an individual awaiting report of the PCR test for COVID-19 receives a report in which his/her age is mentioned as 999 years old, it simply winds up humorous at first but raises questions in the meantime on the reliability of the test result. These instances of typos make the readers end up disparaging the communications as they seemed to have been made public more due to slapdash working practice than other circumstances.
To our great dismay, even academic practices are not devoid of typos. For instance, multiple occurrence of typos crept into the test paper of Nepali subject of grade 11 administered in June 2019. It had triggered a big concern that the paper seriously contravened the language convention by negatively affecting performance of students in the exam. In March 2019, students appearing in the Secondary Education Examination (SEE) got flustered as their test paper for Compulsory English was littered with errors. The Tribhuvan University was criticized for its negligence as its test papers of Bachelor’s degree on Creative English exam of 2018 were a sheer example of negligence-induced typos. The test papers were erroneous by punctuation marks, capitalization and also by multiple instances of factual inaccuracies.
A press release by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs about Nepal’s head of the state’s message of sympathy and grief to Indonesian President Joko Widodo had a serious typo. The disastrous typo that occurred in the release--“Sent a message of congratulations” on “the loss of many lives”--caught social media users’ attention instantly and the ministry had to correct the press release urgently.
This scribe had jointly conducted an intensive research in 2013 also with an objective to find out the status of typos in Nepal’s school textbooks. The study had reviewed a total of 55 textbooks of grades 6-10 published by the government and private publishers. The research report concluded that school textbooks were full of typos requiring due attention for revision and effective monitoring on quality control by the government authority concerned.
More than being merely the howlers on themselves, typos are costly--the explosion of the rocket that launched American interplanetary probe Mariner 1 in 1962 just minutes after take-off due to a missing hyphen being the best example. Personally speaking, this scribe also lost Rs 400,000 a decade ago when a formal letter issued by the Office of Vice Chancellor of Tribhuvan University and undersigned by a professor was rejected by a government office of the United Kingdom on the ground that the letter contained a typographical error. The rejection letter said clearly that “even if” was typed in the letter instead of “although.”
We fear now that quality control and compliance aspects of the public authorities have eroded over the years when it comes to disseminating written messages publically. Typos that creep into important messages basically due to carelessness not only reflect modus operandi of the institutions concerned but also pose questions on their quality control mechanism. Such erroneous communications indicate lax quality control practice on their part. Broadly, these point to the reality that our system has been gradually undermining the possibility to orient ourselves toward promoting perfectionist value of the society. Undoubtedly, negligence-induced typos have been attributive to further eroding public institutions’ credibility.
Typos generally are the result of carelessness. Failure to pause and check before hitting the ‘enter’ and ‘send’ buttons or total disregard to details is the problem. Content automation has not been a practice yet neither having the final drafts of communications reviewed by more than a pair of professional eyes. Typos on social media indicate that intellectual practice is failing among bureaucrats and politicians. Even the academic institutions are disregarding the core purpose of communicating.
No one is infallible. Popular dictum has it that to err is human. Written texts with occasional typos are, therefore, bearable. Even the typo nerds disregard them. However, communications littered with multiple instances of typos are a big problem as they convey merely the half-formed thoughts failing to meet the purpose of messaging. They are reducible so can be detected and corrected before making important communications public. Modern typing devices do not fail as they are created to be more accurate and mechanical than humans. Typos occur because fingers fail but brain and honest efforts can correct them if a writer believes in the set standards and makes every effort to minimize them.

In his classic novel, The Plague, French writer Albert Camus reflects upon the untold deaths in Oran, an Algerian city where the epidemic occurs, as “a hundred million corpses broadcast through history are no more than a puff of smoke in the imagination.” “Since a dead man has no substance unless one has actually seen him dead,” he argues. By imagination, Camus implies the human faculty that throws events of the past into a real-imaginary interface. The want of personalization sets off humans apart from the events which are then waned into a sort of blur. However, it doesn’t entail a semantic abracadabra to deem imagination as a creative faculty with which one could grasp and express the melancholy or the ecstasy of the events with a brio, albeit the actual witness can still paint the more authentic portraits of the events. On the academic front, such an eloquent record of events can possibly be kept by the sociologists through what the American sociologist C Wright Mills called “sociological imagination” expounding the tricks of this trade in a book published in 1959. A “post-modern cowboy”, Mills heralded an aurora in sociology, a multi-disciplinary branch of social science, in the volatile 1960s through a publication that abruptly broke with the dominant pedagogies and practices, fearing such an intellectual prowess, his contemporaries, Seymour Lipset and Neil Smelser, had to warn the world in writing that the worth of his texts was close down to zilch. The reference to Mills’ “sociological imagination”, a treatise on the dialectics of private troubles and public issues, is evoked not as a text that has solely didactic purposes, but as a possible tool to reach the cruising altitude of the ongoing pandemic imagination.    
Having started in Hubei province of China as a pneumonia outbreak in December 2019, the novel coronavirus has swiftly spread across the world with the death toll reaching almost a million. Had the Wuhan authorities discerned the handful of early cases as the presage of global health disaster, and contained the pathogen at its source, this virus would not have made such a dangerous expedition throughout Europe, Asia and Americas. This conjecture has galvanized the fresh discourses about the fault lines of the international political economy. Hordes of other discourses including the specious connection between climate change and pandemic, and the speculative rise of authoritarianism have found prominence. However, looking from an alternative, sociological angle, the botched effort to curb the spread of coronavirus, and the associated failure to save lives has become the debacle of the population state matured in the west in the second half of the 18th century.
According to scholar Michel Foucault, modern power of the population state has been brazenly “exercised on the level of species, the race and the large scale phenomena of population.” It was through the intersection of the rise in economic and military might, and the evolution of “welfare” in the second half of the 18th century which gave rise to “public health” that indexed the features of population through census, ordered mass surveillance and permanent control. The system of extractive, over-administered and panoptic regime, Foucault argues, has caused more holocausts, massacres and genocides in recent history than any time before. While it is quite early to assess which countries have triumphed in the fight against the pandemic through the technologies devised for public health and those appropriated for prosaic security acts, and which country will eventually win the biomedical rivalry by manufacturing the first effective vaccine, the explicit agenda of the population state to save lives from epidemic and endemic illnesses has failed deplorably. Foucault’s historical critique of the public health system is compelling as it parallels Mills’ vision of converting (auto) biographical experiences to a public affair. Foucault, who battled with bouts of depression and a major suicide attempt due to a slew of insults he received for being “sadomasochistic, pervert and homosexual”, had delved into an array of historical details to explore the context of his own sexuality. Given the local context, the chance for sociologists to be the phenomenological witness to the pandemic, unlike frontline workers, is unwonted. Albeit it is neither imperative nor practical for sociologists to anchor every research in the lived experiences, a fair degree of empathy and reflexion is usually asked for.    
The paucity of public health resources and the longstanding corruption has resulted in the serious mismanagement of prevention and control of the ongoing pandemic in Nepal. As the general public critiques the government for acting either by caprice or cupidity, Prime Minister (PM) KP Sharma Oli and his ministers respond by passing the most brutal of remarks and unforgivable gaffes. The context of the government’s ineptitude and the league of its intellectual redemptors is a reminder to sociologists not to collude with the powers that put serious impediment to the research of the threatening perils. As seen in rigorous sociology, scholars seek to absolve the existing powers from culpability through the machinations of abstractionism and empiricism--both censured by Mills--by putting overemphasis on abstract structures over the immediate actors, and keeping a much bigger pool of research subjects, represented by surveys, samples, graphs and percentages, thereby overlooking the bits and struggles of laypersons. If an alternative protocol produces heroes and villains, missing the structures altogether within which the actors perform, sociology has to make a creative shuttle between the two diametrically opposed frames of interpretation.     
In his essay, “The Plight of the Individual in Modern Society”, Swiss psychoanalyst Carl Jung says that for each manifest case, there are at least ten latent cases which seldom get to the point of breaking out, and frequencies of those latent cases are never put on the statistics. It is more demanding for sociologists to detect and scrutinize the latent details than just to shake the manifest crumbs off the research table. In the local context of pandemic, even the quality and quantity of brief data offered by the government sources  is bereft of analytical potential. Doing sociology in this context is comparable to metaphorical walking in the hot coals--arrayed by unbridled corruption, deficient and mismanaged public health system, casteist triage, multiple jeopardies, repeated incidents of suicide, rape and murder, and a battery of insidious problems. As reductionist discourses of neoliberalism and biomedicine are making copious reviews and rapid-fire forecasts of the pandemic, the sociologists have a burden to protract the critical examinations to the pre-existing conditions of our social, political and economic systems as the deaths are not solely linked to individual health histories but the overarching system that governs those individual bodies. If neoliberalism and biomedicine provide rather perceptible influences on sociologists through bureaucratic capitals, the unreflexive associations to parties, status groups and classes operate in a concealed routine. One example suffices to make a point of such an association. As I tried to interview people affected by the pandemic, every person who came to my contact was from the middle class. This middle-class lifeworld of sociologists brackets them from the latencies of pain imperceptibly submerged under the feet of their own. This attitude and behavior meets the upper hand when we get accustomed more to telephones and cyberspaces than to offline, commonplace spaces.
The theme of a paper with a gist that social ruptures give ways to knowledge production, as presented by a prominent sociologist in a recent webinar, is apropos to the context of pandemic if that knowledge contributes to complement the long-awaiting social repair. If sociology is an answer to the convoluted questions of our social life, as signaled by Ulrich Beck in Politics in Risk Society, it needs to augment its imagination by dissociating it from ad hoc and reductionist discourses as well as by shrugging off too much of abstraction and empiricist fetishes.

Nepali theater industry’s struggle for stability has been an age-long affair. The uncertainty around its sustainability, chiefly due to the imbalance between its financing and revenue modality, has kept the commerce of the industry on shaky grounds. Worsening the case, the uncertainty after the COVID-19 pandemic has further risked the future of theater institutions and artists of the fraternity. In light of such predicament, and to outline a possible road ahead, around 20 theater practitioners gathered for a discussion at Shilpee Theater on August 1. Initiated by Theater Hub and hosted by Shilpee Theater, the session brought out personal reflections, insecurities and challenges faced by theater groups and artists, especially during the lockdown, and it also facilitated a brief discourse on the future and revival of the industry as a whole.  
Struggling to survive
The Nepali theater industry has been virtually shut down since early March following the government’s directives to restrict mass gatherings. With no shows happening for almost five months, and a complete shutdown in alternative income sources like theater training, academic teaching and social/community theater projects, artists have been stretched to the limit for basic survival. Freelance artists, who often are remunerated on project-by-project basis, are mostly bearing the brunt of this protracted halt. Theater groups are, on the other hand, hard-pressed due to the rising financial liabilities amid no business. Artistic Director at Shilpee Yubaraj Ghimire said that the drying up of the organization's savings and an unforeseeable future has raised concerns about the institution's survival. Up until now, his institution has been barely managing to pay the lease rent, cover the electricity bills and maintain kitchen supplies for all resident artists. The fear of paychecks, however, hasn’t been the only insecurity that performing artists are currently going through. Many even have been struggling with the creative drought that has befallen all. The need to refrain from human proximity and collective process of making art has taken its toll on all artists, creating a sense of self-doubt and exhaustion. Without the process of making plays, artists are also worried of the possible stiffness that can hit them once they return back to the stage. 
No state support
Much like its financial vulnerability, Nepali theater has also been bereft of guardianship from the state--a unanimous reflection made by attendees at Shilpee. Although the state’s negligence toward Nepali theater industry isn’t new, a complete tone-deaf demeanor during these desperate times has piqued all stage professionals. On June 25, the theater fraternity had submitted a nine-point demand to the Nepal Academy of Music and Drama (NAMUDA) mainly outlining the crisis for theaters, the absence of government policy and actionable plans, and the lack of budgetary support for theater groups and artists. But, much to the dismay of the fraternity, their formal submission hasn’t been acceded for over a month. So far, barring efforts from a few independent theaters and the Federation of Theater Organization Nepal (FETO), the authorities have initiated no notable relief mechanism. Beyond these myopic problems, the academy and the Ministry of Culture, who are often indulged in passing the buck, haven’t genuinely realized the contribution made by independent theater institutions to the overall art atmosphere of Nepal. The shortcomings of these responsible agencies are projected through the lackluster efforts seen in organizing impactful theater festivals, drafting policies, plans and databases for theater events and people, and providing national and international platforms to deserving candidates. It is the creative drive and continuous dedication of independent drama organizations that have helped the theater industry achieve cross-border success, both content and quality-wise, especially in the South Asian region. Last year, NAMUDA was allocated with a fiscal budget worth Rs 60 million, but it did not trickle down to substantial and noteworthy theater activities, and the primary contributors within the independent theater scene were untouched by the budget. 
Urgent needs
Speaking at the event, actor and director Dilip Ranabhat accentuated the immediate need of institutionalizing the theater industry itself, which might embolden the bargaining capacity of thespians working in it. Similarly, Kedar Shrestha of Theater Mall stressed on revisiting the strategic vision of Nepali theater altogether. Rather than aiming at imminent survival tactics, he said the industry could only steady its ship by making the government agencies and stakeholders concerned more responsible in creating a secure atmosphere for artists. The discourse, however, didn’t only focus on ways of resorting to the government. Theater practitioners brainstormed about possible short-term workshops, courses that could be facilitated under proper distancing and hygiene protocols. Components like playwriting, theater management and interactions on other topical issues could be an icebreaker to begin with. And once the lockdown eases and things get back to normal, staging plays under open air could be another viable option that theater artists can think of. Theater groups like Katha Ghera and Shilpee have already executed few outdoor performances so far, but it was mainly targeted toward putting pressure on the government. To do so more frequently, and for an orchestrated storytelling, theaters should be careful about managing the audience. Spacious amphitheaters located at Taragaon museum or the Dabali (open square platform) of Academy Hall can be considered as immediate venues. Finally, the need for an entrepreneurial mindset in theater was collectively realized by many. Theater scholar and writer Jeebesh Rayamajhi put forward an idea of establishing a fund for theater institutions, an arrangement that can help create a one-window fund generating facility, and bring the corporate world and I/NGOs closer to the theaters. The presence of such independent setup will help not only in smoothening the financing of the industry but also help make the scenario more professional and organized. 
Out of all things, the session was a catharsis to many artists; a forum to vent out frustrations, fears and concerns about the future. The positivity emanated by the collective presence will certainly give confidence in the pursuit of finding a silver lining for Nepali theater industry in the days to come.

Art is a powerful form of expression and is essential for the development of a vibrant culture and functioning of democratic societies. However, the recent controversy over Sophiya Thapa's song, ""Aba ko Teej no brata please"" which translates to ""This Teej, no fasting please!"", raises concerns over the state of arts in Nepal; are our artistes making unfair use of artistic freedom or are we becoming intolerant toward ideas and arts?
The Hindu Jagaran Manch, a Hindu religious organization, published a statement demanding the song be removed from Youtube, stating that it hurts the sentiments of Hindus. Since the release of song, Thapa has been facing severe online abuse, harassment and threats of assault and death. The threats have forced distributor Highlights Nepal to make the video private.
Teej is a festival celebrated by Hindu women worshiping lord Shiva; married women observe Teej for longevity and good health of their husband, and unmarried ones for an ideal husband. In Teej, women observe daylong fasting without drinking a single drop of water. Apart from spirituality and faith, Teej had its own social aspect, which allowed women to visit their maternal home, get a break from their monotonous life, have delicious food, express their joy and sorrow in songs and dance. However, with changing lifestyle, the way of observing Teej in urban areas has turned it to lavish partyin and celebrations. 
The song by Thapa, goes on to say ""This Teej let's not have any fasting or water of others feet; men and women both are equal."" The song presents the idea that men and women both are equal and calls on women to boycott the practices which promote inequality. Teej has been used as a symbol, and she proposes to celebrate Teej by spreading happiness rather than fasting. 
The Hindu Jagaran Manch vehemently objected, concerned over the message of the song, and alleged that it disrespects Hindu traditions pointing fasting is an integral part of Teej and its removal will limit its celebrations merely to partying and concerts.   
Celebrating festivals and observing fast is completely subject to one's beliefs. No one should be forced to do or not do anything against one's beliefs. There is a large group of women who don’t fast or celebrate Teej. A lot of women also find Teej to be a patriarchal tradition to enforce male supremacy and claims it promotes subservience to male masculinity.  
Apart from entertainment, arts also contribute to social debates, sometimes bringing counter-discourses and potential counterweights to existing power centers. The song by Thapa also puts an idea for social debate and countering potential existing power centers. The song is a remarkable blow against the unequal norms of society, of decorating, limiting, and subordinating women.
The Hindu organization and public at large find the song objectionable, as it encroaches the culture and hurt their religious sentiments. However, there is polarization of opinions about the song. The critics call it blasphemous whereas, the supporters argue that the song aims to promote equality and should not be deleted. At the center, people appreciate the song, with the reservation that the singer should not have appealed to others to boycott fasting. She could have used a much better way to portray the message.
However, the feminists view the criticism of the song as patriarchal mindset of society. It is part of masculine moral policing, in the name of culture, religion, and morality, which has been a tool against women's liberty. The recent sexist and humiliating comments about a girl wearing a backless top on a government motorcycle is also a blatant example of such misogynist attitude. 
Not to fast on Teej is a personal choice of the singer, which she is free to express in the form of a song. Being a Nepali citizen, she has fundamental rights under the Constitution to have an opinion and express them. The constitutionally protected right can be curtailed under certain grounds, but the song doesn't affect the religious belief and social harmony in any ways as accused. Rather, it reflects the changing image of society.
The song enjoys protection under freedom of speech as it doesn't pose any imminent threat of lawlessness.
Having said that, the same freedom of speech also grants people freedom to criticize her song and make counter opinions. But forcing her to delete the song, harassing and threatening for physical damage reflects the intolerance toward creative arts.
Where are we heading?
According to The State of Artistic Freedom 2020, a report by Freemuse, an independent organization working for protection and promotion of Arts and artists, religion is the third major threat faced by artists throughout the world.  
In Nepal as well, we have witnessed the violation of artistic freedom for the sake of protecting religious sentiments. The death threats to artist Manish Harijan for his painting 'The rise of collaterals' by the World Hindu Federation and padlocking of the Siddhartha Gallery for exhibiting it, represent the intolerance of religious groups toward art.
I don't believe that arts should be left free to humiliate religions and hurt religious sentiments and the law rightly provides reasonable restrictions to limit that. But intolerance is not appropriate, as it promotes the rise of fundamentalists. If things are offensive and blasphemous, it should be challenged in the court. Threatening, abusing and harassing artists do not provide a solution.
The European Court of Human Rights in Handyside v. United Kingdom held that freedom of expression covers ideas that offend, shock or disturb. Therefore, rather than censoring such works, we should develop pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness. 
Intolerance suffocates arts. We, therefore, should promote healthy environment for arts to flourish and ideas to be exchanged freely. Freedom of expression is integral to modern democracy and should not be curtailed by misogynist attitudes and irrational religious fanaticism.

I was 13 when I first got noticeably bad vaginal burn on the fifth day of my period. When I shared this with my mom, she advised me to drink more water. Hydration did not work for me and this pain continued at the end of every period. I was in period poverty and had no expert to advise me what is happening and what should be done.
Growing up, I experienced that intolerable burning in my vaginal area in almost all of my post periodic days which would last from a day to four-five days. It is not that I experienced it round the clock. I used to have mild pain which I would notice only if I focused on that area but there was another kind of pain. The second kind of pain would not come scheduled, and arrive sometimes while I was about to sleep, sometimes during the assembly line or during group meetings. If I was alone in a room, I used to murmur with closed eyes, lie down, put a cold water bottle above and try to find some relief but it's different when you are with someone. I used to feel that it has come but I could not show my feelings and had to pretend to be normal. Something like electric current used to pass from that area up to the heart covering sides of the stomach and little up toward the head.
Honestly, sometimes I used to feel major nerves in my torso during those episode of currents. I used to feel all the heat coming up and tears would fill my eyes instantly. My fingers would hold each other together in a fist. Sometimes they would automatically try to reach and push back that part as a reflex action but secondary thoughts ‘to be socially civilized’, used to stop my hands from reaching there. That anxiety would last for 30-40 seconds at peak, three-four times a day and would pass away. This little time used to be emotionally disturbing. I used to feel relief for some time after the burning attack and would forget about that for the next 25-26 days until the next period arrived.
Two years back, while I was preparing to give sessions on menstrual hygiene to a group of school students, I first became familiar with premenstrual syndrome (PMS) which includes mood swings, headache, heaviness etc. just before having a period. Getting to know PMS, I searched for post-menstrual syndrome as well expecting to read something similar to my issue but surprisingly there was nothing related to post-menstrual things.  When I told my colleague about not finding it, I got to know that it was only me who was having those syndromes. All those years I was assuming that every woman experiences the thing I was experiencing. That afternoon, for the first time I searched for different reasons for vaginal burn. There, for the first time I read about polycystic ovary syndrome (or polycystic ovarian syndrome – PCOS).
PCOS  is a complex hormonal condition. ‘Polycystic’ literally translates as ‘many cysts’. This refers to the many partially formed follicles on the ovaries, which each contain an egg. The ovaries may develop numerous small collections of fluid (follicles) and fail to regularly release eggs leading to offer secondary side effects ranging from issues on regular menstrual cycle to prolonged diabetics and hormonal depression with suicidal thoughts.
Many of my symptoms including not being able to lose fat in certain regions of the body, having masculine physical character, irregular periods and vaginal pain matched with the symptoms of PCOS and I decided to visit a gynecologist as soon as possible.  My first ultrasound made my doubt come true.
Even though PCOS is considered a gynecological problem, it consists of 28 clinical symptoms. Women with PCOS produce higher-than-normal amounts of male hormones (androgens). The imbalance in one major hormone causes imbalance all over the body including imbalance in level of insulin leading to obesity and diabetes, imbalance in thyroid hormones leading to loss of hairs and the reduction on the level of dopamine (stress reducing hormone) could lead you to be drowned into periodic depressions. Besides this, hair loss and excessive hair growth, irregular periods, periods on long intervals, acne and easier weight gain or difficulty to lose weight are some other frequent symptoms. 
This hormone imbalance causes women to skip menstrual periods and makes it harder for them to get pregnant. According to the data generated by Fertility Center Nepal, 40% of infertility and abortion in women are due to some effects of PCOS. It has been shown that out of 100 women at least three and up to 26 women would be a victim of this syndrome.
Researchers haven’t been able to determine what exactly causes severe symptoms of PCOS, but they suspect that it may be a combination of genes and environment. Also, it might be different for different people. Some doctors believe that high levels of male hormones prevent the ovaries from producing hormones and making eggs normally. Rise in the cases of PCOS nowadays has been assumed to be due to the lavish lifestyle we all are living although most cases come genetically. 
PCOS do not have a fixed cure. Since this affects for a long time, doctors recommend some medications throughout your life and advice to never stay dehydrated, never gain weight or reduce it if you’ve gained, do regular physical exercises (including some specific exercises) and have a healthier diet. The body mass index should never shoot above 25. Some severe cases might get medicines to normalize hormones and to regulate periods. Women who want to get pregnant might have to go through some process of surgery and more medicines.
In my case, my major problem was periodic and unscheduled vaginal burn. I didn’t have obesity, extra growth of body hair or any dangerous mental problems. The doctor told me that my cause is genetic. After taking medicines for six months, my periods are now regular and not that hard as before, I still get a burning sensation but it is less frequent and isn’t like that before I started medication. My body looks more feminine nowadays. PCOS was responsible for many of my personal problems but I have finally come to be familiar with my own emotion and my own body. All kinds of emotions we get like being happy, being sad, being angry, being fearful etc. is the result of the activities of our hormones. Our emotional health contributes to our mental health. With primary cause being PCOS, you have a chance to get secondary problems of emotional and mental health issues and these secondary problems can lead you to tertiary problems.
It still might take another year or two to claim that I no longer have any gynecological problem. The change in me might not be just because of medicines but because of my efforts to eat healthy and exercise. I tried boosting estrogen (female hormone) level by taking an egg and drinking one glass of milk every day. Adding soy diet would be helpful if you are a vegan as these three foods are reported to induce your level of female hormones. 
Many girls out there have problems with vaginal burn but of normal kind. Dehydration and use of gelled pad are the major cause for this problem and they can easily avoid this pain.
If you are among those who get this syndrome genetically, you might have already learned to deal with it. Never lose your hope to get a healthier body. There are cases where PCOS has disappeared completely by medication. For those who have got symptoms as mentioned above but are still medically undiagnosed, I recommend you to visit a doctor as soon as possible as the longer you wait, the more complicated your problem will get. For those who haven’t got any form of PCOS or gynecological problem yet, don’t take a single risk to get it. Exercise, stay hydrated all the time, always choose a healthier diet and most of all, although you would love eating paanipuri, chatpate and spicy pickles: stop eating all forms of spicy things. Why?
Here’s a simple explanation to this. Our body is a combination of chemical things. What we eat is also a combination of chemicals. Our hormones are chemicals as well. Spicy junk foods contain unhealthy chemicals which when inside our body, changes the normal level of our hormones and those hormones might change our whole body. If you don't believe this, try remembering how you get so energized after eating paanipuri and have pimples the next day.
I misunderstood many of my symptoms such as not being able to lose my belly fat, my masculine look and depressions as something else. Just a few days back, while having an online session on PCOS I got to know that the reason for my eyebrow and eyelash loss is also linked with hormonal disturbance which happened because of PCOs.
It’s not pleasant to know that your own hormones could lead you to something big like depression without other mental and social issues. It is not nice to know that you are born with something that will make many your days worse. Being a woman, we already have to deal with a lot of secondary problems. If we let our genital health come in between, our life would be more difficult. This is reason enough for every woman to be cautious about one's health. PCOS-like disorders aren’t something to take lightly. In this period of lockdown, when most of us out there are on course of gaining weight, I request you to go and search on how obesity affects your genital health. Maybe this will make you start exercising and sweating regularly. Exercise should not be done just to maintain your figure but also to have a healthy body. 
Stay safe, stay healthy.
Say no to any form of genital disorders.

On June 18, when Prime Minister (PM) KP Oli was busy trivializing COVID-19 deaths, a 16-year-old-boy living in an ill-managed local quarantine center in Dhanusha, was battling against severe diarrhea. Untended and untreated when most needed, Raju Sada later succumbed to the illness on June 22 after being moved to the isolation ward of Janakpur Provincial Hospital. The graphic visuals of Sada shuddering in pain was not only disheartening and excruciating to watch but also utterly frustrating and indignant, and could make anyone feel nauseated toward the system that has dragged the nation into a mess.  
The government’s failure in handling the pandemic needs neither any exposure nor elaboration. But, more than that, it is the unabashed apathy and tone-deaf attitude of the premiership at the helm that has rubbed salt in the wound. PM Oli’s chest-thumping assertions and rhetoric have so far only produced sound but no soul. In times of such crisis, and especially when people are desperately looking up to him for reassurance, Oli has failed to feel the pulse of the nation. The absence of a humane, sensitive and logical attribute in the prime minister just goes to prove that he seriously lacks emotional intelligence. 
Emotional Intelligence, a psychological attribute propounded by the American psychologist duo Peter Salovey and John Mayer, primarily focuses on the comprehensive understanding of self and others’ emotions and using it as a knowledge base to better handle communications and relationships. The contemporary theory of emotional intelligence--which is further classified into five different skill sets like self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy and social relationship skills--has recently been gaining traction in areas of organizational and political leadership.
The first dimension of emotional intelligence, self-awareness, stresses on the importance of introspection, a rare phenomenon seen in PM Oli’s recent demeanor. In the past few months, the only time he has been visibly introspective, and has confessed his realization, was when he revoked the ordinance to amend the Political Party Act, that too after facing a lot of flak from the opposition and people within his own party. While explaining the intricacies of emotional intelligence, Mayer has also rejected an often-discerned fallacy related to it: high self-confidence equates to high emotional intelligence. Therefore, Oli, with his assertions and conceit, could still be considered as an authoritative chief but not necessarily an emotionally intelligent leader. The larger-than-life persona that he has created, and its ensuing vainglory, has stopped Oli from becoming more rooted and relatable to the commoners. 
Oli also needs to understand the stake and sensitivity that comes with the role that he has undertaken. This will help him self-regulate his emotions better and be less impulsive in public presentations. The countless futile jabs and mockeries that he has made during recent times have made people see an insecure and irate person underneath the fierce orator. When fellow parliamentarian Gagan Thapa raised a pertinent question regarding Oli’s false claims about the immunity of Nepalis, Oli’s rebuttal was simply heedless and irresponsible. It shows how defensive he has been getting with any sort of criticism. To hone this much-needed self-regulatory skill, Oli needs to suspend his immature judgments and be more pragmatic and placid while making claims that have national and international ramifications. Had he been more humble and tactful, people would have been more tolerant with his dealings.  
The discrepancy between Oli’s preaching and practices has also raised many people's eyebrows. The way he has been defending controversial and dubious proceedings and persons has raised an alarm regarding his motivation, which, according to him, has always remained unpolluted and selfless. But unless he finds a tangible way to transfer his perceptions to people outside, he cannot stimulate others’ motivation. To achieve that, he has to pay heed to the ongoing hunger strike by youths, be vocal and intolerant of malfeasance and fraudulence, and engage more with strategic units to revive the nation from this fallout. As New Zealand’s PM Jacinda Ardern says, ""The true measure of leadership is the ability to confront the anxiety of people of their time."" Our PM needs to do exactly that. 
Oli can learn more from Ardern, especially from her approach in being exceptionally empathetic as a nation’s figurehead. Through her active participation in gay pride parades, standing in unison with families of terror victims, and her recent handling of COVID-19, Ardern has been exemplifying the true spirit of being a people’s leader. Sadly, such tenderness and comfort has been lacking in our case. Instead, we’ve seen Oli underplay migrants’ pathos, trivialize the gravity of the coronavirus symptoms, and indulge in blaming the media and other stakeholders. As someone who has participated in several freedom movements in the past, Oli’s ability to connect with the mass should have been spot on, but his sharp departure from a free and inclusive ideology has left everyone feeling alienated.  
Oli’s ability to manage relationships has taken a severe hit as a corollary of his emotional intelligence deficiency. Be it within his political clique, with his nationals, or with the neighbors, Oli’s lack of emotional intelligence has been straining all relationships, jeopardizing the nation’s future. Many, in the past, have praised Oli’s stance on issues relating to nationalism and international ties. However, taking his singular definition of nationalism and overdoing it, laced with absent-minded retorts, will surely sour ties with the immediate neighbors. 
As rifts and dissonances continue by the day, it is difficult to tell whether it is already too late for Oli to reconcile his wrongdoings, but, for whatever time he remains the head of the government, he has no other choice than to be cognizant of his emotional intelligence, and let go of his stubborn hunger to become popular.

With fear and uncertainty in every sector from economy to health, the only thing that could provide us assurance is vaccine. The only hope is for a vaccine to combat this pandemic and make our lives normal once again. With promising results of trials around the world, vaccine nationalism is on the rise. Currently, there are more than 135 vaccines in preclinical trials, 18 in phase I, 12 in phase II, four in phase III and one vaccine approved for limited use. Almost all of them are developed by wealthier countries or those with a huge economy.
According to the Merriam Webster dictionary, nationalism refers to loyalty and devotion to a nation, which tends to imply the placing of that nation above others. But nationalism has taken a dangerous turn, and we see more of ultranationalism these days  “My nation first” approach is what leads to vaccine nationalism. It occurs when a country manages to secure doses of vaccine for its own citizens or residents before they are made available to other countries. This is achieved when the government of a particular country signs a prior agreement with a vaccine manufacturer. This will especially hurt developing and underdeveloped nations like ours in the fight against COVID-19 pandemic.
Global problems require global solutions. In the midst of a pandemic we need science not politics for global strategy to allocate, distribute and verify the delivery of COVID-19 vaccines but it’s politics that accentuates vaccine nationalism and leads to disruption of global supply chain.
A few worrying statements have been made amidst promising vaccine trials around the world recently.
The chief executive of the Serum Institute of India, the world’s largest producer of vaccine doses, said most of its vaccine, at least initially, would have to go to his countrymen before it goes abroad.
European nations, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Wellcome Trust committed over $8 billion to finance Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) dedicated to rapid deployment of new COVID-19-related health technologies. Yet the United States, Russia, and India have chosen not to participate in this initiative.
AstraZeneca reported that due to the UK’s $79 million investment, the first 30 million doses of the vaccine it is developing, with the University of Oxford would be allocated to the country. Then, on May 21, the United States pledged as much as $1.2 billion to the company in order to obtain at least 300 million doses, with the first to be delivered as early as October. The pledge to AstraZeneca is part of the Trump administration’s Operation Warp Speed for securing vaccines for Americans as early as possible.
The history of vaccine nationalism goes back to 2009 when H1N1 (swine flu) pandemic killed an estimated 284,000 people across the world. Some of the wealthiest nations like the USA secured a pre-purchase agreement with potential vaccine manufacturers. During those times, maximum doses that could be produced globally were 2 billion but the USA alone negotiated to buy 600,000 doses. It was only when the pandemic began to unwind and demand for a vaccine dropped that the developed countries offered to donate vaccine to poorer countries.
Nationalism cannot go hand in hand with global public health principles. There are no international regulatory bodies or law that govern the pre-purchase agreements like those mentioned above. With the rise of Donald Trump in the USA, Boris Johnson in the UK, Narendra Modi in India and many more elsewhere, the wave of ultranationalism has been spreading in an exponential manner. With such ultranationalist behavior it may be very difficult for us to halt this pandemic.
Even if any vaccine is developed for COVID-19, it will take more than a year to reach countries like Nepal, if politics dominates science. With vaccine nationalism along with lack of global strategy and evidence-based global supply chain, we may never contain this virus.
I was always taught nationalism in perspective of isolation and alienation from other nations. It was only when I read Yuval Noah Harari that my concept of nationalism changed and I got a different perspective. The concept of nationalism never accounts as an isolation or separation from one another. The concepts actually originated for bigger cooperation. For instance; the river Nile was lifeblood for ancient tribes that lived along the river. It irrigated their fields and supported their livelihood. It was an unpredictable ally. With too little rain—people starved to death; too much rain—and the river overflowed its banks and destroyed the entire village. No tribe could solve these problems by themselves, because each controlled a small section of the river and had small number of laborers. Only through the collective efforts of all the tribes they could build huge dams and hundreds of kilometers of canal, and could hope to restrain and harness the mighty river. Thus, these small tribes coalesced and formed a nation and developed a feeling of nationality using various national emblems, songs, culture, et cetera.
So, we must make our global governing bodies like the WHO, the Global Fund, the CEPI and GAVI stronger so that evidence-based approaches can be inculcated to halt the pandemic. We should use nationalism for the greater goods of others, rather than changing it into jingoist ultranationalism. We must remember that it’s the virus which is our foe. With global governance and evidence-based approach, we can stop transmission of virus and protect the vulnerable groups, no matter where they live. The pandemic can be halted only through timely, equitable and global access of vaccine. It’s global solidarity and global cooperation, which can help us eliminate this pandemic. It will be an arduous job but it can be completed if ultranationalist behaviors are kept at bay.

Jay is a friend. He’s been married to Jia for the past 25 years. They have two beautiful school-going children.  Jia’s mother has few underlying health issues, so she lives with them as well.  Jay is a caring father, a loving husband, and a compassionate son-in-law. He is a good man in every sense of the word.
About a week ago, Jay’s brother, who lives four hours away, extended an invitation to spend a weekend on a golf retreat. These brothers usually meet about three times a year and all they do is play golf. 
The plan sounded great, except that this time it was different. Jay’s brother, within the past few weeks, had tested positive for COVID-19. Fortunately, he’d recuperated and had tested negative at the time when Jay was invited.
Meanwhile, Jia was a little nervous about this invitation and wanted him not to go. She was concerned that he was visiting a home that was already infected and she feared he could potentially, somehow, contract the virus, even though it sounded rationally safe at the point. Notably, she feared for her mother who has underlying health issues and could be the victim if this hell broke loose.
Jay called me and asked if he should go putt those balls, or in contrast, listen to his wife and avoid potential suffering for his family by staying put at home. I pondered about the impasse and realized this wasn’t about golf or mother-in-law, to begin with. His challenge was way deeper than what was presented prima facie. There was a moral choice that had to be made and he would have to make that without the benefit of a past experience. This was a place where he would have to tread along blindfolded with absolutely no contour or cane.
Incidentally, this isn’t an isolated happenstance. 
We also have found ourselves, where Jay finds himself in this narrative, oftentimes totally torn between two or more glaring choices with no reference point to hinge on. 
There are ideas, and they often meet at the crossroads. Only one gets to linearly move on toward the logical space in the future and has a life of its own while the others are left behind. When this happens, we bequeath our approval to just one course that caters either to our reasons or to our feelings. 
How Jean-Paul Sartre sees this state of affairs in ‘Existentialism is a Humanism’ is explained in a story of a young man who finds torn between going to England to join the Free French Forces to defeat the Germans or staying near his old mother and helping her live the rest of her life in peace. He realizes his mother lives only for him and that his disappearance or his death would give her sadness since there’s no one else in her life. On the other hand, joining the French Forces would give him a sense of purpose where he could contribute for the greater good by defeating the Nazis, while in the passing, he could also deliver retribution for his brother’s death.
Sartre thinks of such a moment, where choosing dwindles, reason relapses and action stops cold midway, as the moment where human predicament thrives the most. What could help this young lad choose? Which of those two choices is the more useful aim in the absence of omniscience? Let’s delve a little.
Max Horkheimer in his ‘Eclipse of Reason’ argues how human reason is replete with untenable undergirds and is there only to regulate our preferences and our relationships with other human beings and nature. ‘Reason’ as an organ for perceiving and determining the guiding principles of our lives has come to be regarded as outdated. In other words, reason for our choice has become synonymous with metaphysics, and metaphysics with mythology and superstition. 
Our reasons, our values, what they deliver to us are uncertainties because they upsurge in randomness depending on what pool of thoughts and heuristics are available at that moment of such deliverance.
Finally, this brings us down to the other resort, our last one.
Perhaps, ‘reason’ isn’t what we should cater to then. It’s not a tool sufficiently endowed to tell us how we ought to reason our way into an unknown realm. Instead, maybe we should move forward with our instinctual feelings. Something that makes us feel good, self-righteous, and where the heart eventually finds its peace.
Among many others, Yuval Harari explains this phenomenon in “Homo Deus’ as humanism.
In the absence of an external paradigm that can assign meanings to our undertakings, we have begun to selfishly consult ourselves about how we feel about what we do. Thusly, what feels good is good, and what feels bad is bad. And if an action does not cause anyone to feel bad, there’s nothing wrong with it. That which thrills us gets blessed and that which does not gets cursed. In ethics, the humanist motto is if it feels good do it. In aesthetics, humanism says that beauty is in the eye of the beholder and human feelings are the ultimate source of all meanings and authority.
Coming back to Jay, I do not know which way the choice will take him.
All I can see is how helplessly crippled he is within his human limits.
He could either reason himself into staying home and potentially mitigate the sufferings for his family or he could intuit his way to that golf course and putt away some balls and feel fulfilled about his undertakings. That choice is for him to make.
For me though, a moment like this would go remiss if I didn’t invoke what Ludwig Wittgenstein wanted all to know toward the end of Tractatus. And I (mis)quote him “Whereof one cannot choose, thereof one must hang on.”
 Unfortunately for Jay, hanging on isn’t a choice.

Living a healthy lifestyle has always fascinated me. I had been trying to include exercise, yoga, meditation, healthy food, and diet in my routine but the many distractions in my life and my chronic lack of commitment weren’t allowing me to do so. The COVID-19 Lockdown came as a great opportunity for me to set my commitments right.
Although the lockdown in Nepal started from March 23, we closed our office from March 20 and posted ‘working from home’ on our promotional site. The volume of work decreased significantly. So, I felt freer to focus on my quest for a healthier lifestyle. I began with a very humble thing adding shower to my morning routine. I used to be very lazy when it came to grooming myself. Since I learned about the many benefits of cold showers including reduced stress, anxiety, and depression and boost in energy and immunity, I have been taking a cold shower every morning.
I also started brisk evening walks doing rounds on my rooftop for about 45 minutes with some stretching and pushups in between. After the exercise, I would lie down and stargaze for 15 minutes, meditate, and try to ‘connect to the universe’. I also started consuming herbal tea - ginger, fresh rosemary, oregano, and mint and sometimes turmeric water. My family, including my parents, replaced the usual white rice with brown. We used to believe that brown rice is expensive but we found out there are cheaper and tastier varieties of brown rice in the market with price range comparable to that of the regular white rice.
I had first heard about intermittent fasting six months before the lockdown from a friend who used to practice it. While we ate grilled cheese sandwich with bacon, he used to sip at coffee without sugar. I also came across an interview of a popular Nepali actress practicing intermittent fasting and heard about it from many others. So, I googled it and found the theory very interesting. Actually, fasting is a part of the major traditions and religions everywhere. Buddhists, Muslims, Hindus, and Christians from around the world have been practicing it for millennia. With modernization of diet patterns, fasting was increasingly cast aside as something rooted in blind faith. Then in 2016, Yoshinori Ohsumi, a Japanese cell biologist was awarded the Nobel Prize for his discovery of autophagy, a process that degrades and recycles cellular components. In other words, autophagy is a process of ‘self-eating’, in which our body ‘eats’ its own old/dead cells, and recycles and renews itself.
A new health trend followed his discovery. It was called intermittent fasting. Many people around the world and some in Nepal have been practicing it. Going with the trend, I and my parents also started practicing it. There are three ways of practicing intermittent fasting. Our practice follows the ‘16:8’ rule. We fast for 16 hours from 9 pm in the evening till 1 pm the next afternoon. After that, we allow ourselves to eat. During our fasts, we drink only water and herbal tea without sugar and milk; even lemon water is not allowed. Since my parents are taking regular medicines, I made them consult the doctor before deciding to continue with the practice. My father had to stop it but my mother can continue and she has been reaping some visible benefits from it in terms of health and happiness.
Though most people seem to be aware about its weight-loss benefits, there are many other health benefits of fasting. Our evolutionary past tells us that as hunter-gatherers, we had to go for hours and days without food and our bodies, thus, developed a mechanism to deal with starvation. That mechanism is deeply intertwined with healing and other bodily systems. We go through substantial damage every day with any work we do. Our cells need constant repair. But if we keep eating, our bodily resources are forced to stay so busy digesting and processing the food that the efficiency of our overall healing gets compromised. Moreover, the fat reserves that we have in store never gets utilized. However, if one hasn’t eaten for several hours, the body will start utilizing its own fat reserves, that is often a source of many chronic conditions, in the absence of new food to fuel us  in a process called ‘ketosis’ – starvation-induced autophagy. I slowly learned about the many benefits of prolonged fasting – from slowing down aging, controlling inflammation, revitalizing our cells and detoxifying them to even preventing cancer. A YouTube video by Dr Mindy Plezon on what happens to our bodies with each day of fasting gave me further valuable insight on the subject.
Convincing my parents about extended fast (72-hour water fast) wasn’t easy. I, first, watched many videos with people sharing their personal experience on the subject and convinced myself of its benefits. I, then, showed my parents a few of those videos and explained them the concept and theory behind it. My father had advised me to start with a 24-hour fast but the benefits of a 72-hour fast and the absence of any significant risks (for someone like me) tempted me to go with the longer version. My mother usually finds it difficult to bear through her 24-hour fasts on Teej festival. So I could understand her concern regarding my 72-hour fast. But I told her I was free to break the fast anytime I experienced anything untoward. So my parents agreed and I started the fast at 2 pm, Friday, May 29, after lunch.
Some experts mention that lack of salt intake while fasting may cause severe and acute health conditions. I had learned that consuming salt with water in the morning does not hamper ketosis and that Himalayan pink salt is packed with more than 80 types of minerals and is known to be very good for our overall health. So, I decided to mix some Himalayan pink salt with my glass of water in the morning. During the fast some people drink only water, some drink herbal tea and black coffee without sugar, and some recommend a spoon of apple cider vinegar with a glass of water once a day. I took a cup of black coffee during the day, a spoon of apple cider vinegar with a glass of water, rosemary and oregano tea, and lots of water. The gut is often called the second brain since the enteric nervous system can generate motor activity in the gut independent of the brain and spinal cord. Moreover, our moods and thought patterns are, in part, dependent on how healthy our gut biota is. Even depression and other mental conditions are linked with gastrointestinal problems and imbalance in gut flora. Anecdotal evidence points toward the possibility that a pinch of salt with a glass of water every morning may help the bacteria in our guts flourish.
I didn’t experience any significant discomfort on the first day. I didn’t really even feel hungry. I did some pushups that evening and slept well at night. Day two started normally and till about our usual lunch time (1:15 pm), I was doing well. But shortly after, I started feeling hungry. I went to the kitchen for some water where my mother was preparing lunch. The aroma of the vegetables was very tempting. But I stuck with my water and herbal tea all day. In the evening I started feeling weak but I still went to the roof for exercise. I walked for just 15 minutes and did just five pushups (I usually do 10-15 times in a set). I started feeling a little dizzy in the evening. I think I should have avoided visiting the kitchen during cooking-hours as some people in the YouTube videos had suggested; it did make things a bit harder. They had also warned that the second day would be difficult– they were correct. It took me long to fall asleep that night and the quality of sleep wasn’t very good.
Day three started with a similar feeling -some dizziness and weakness and absolutely no urge to empty the bowels (as expected). At lunchtime, I went to the kitchen to see what my parents were having (again, against my good judgment). Never in my life had I imagined I would experience such intense craving for food. The heavenly aroma of the vegetables, the cucumber on the table and every edible thing in the kitchen were urging me to break the fast. The third day started from 2:00 pm (since the fast had started at around 2:00 pm two days earlier). According to the video testimonies, day-three is usually much easier but that was not the case for me. I could feel more weakness and dizziness setting in. I could only sleep for about four hours that night. But with the fast coming to an end, I was happily anticipating all the health benefits.
Day four was the day I was supposed to break the fast. I had learned that a big feast after a fast can create problems and it is best to avoid sugar and limit carbohydrates during that period. A small amount of protein is all that people recommend. So, I took a few fried sticks of tofu, some spinach and four pieces of pointed gourd. I then took cucumber and fruits at 4:00 pm and two slices of bread at night. Breaking the fast was quite satisfying but my energy level was yet to get back to normal. The fifth day was much better. I didn't measure my weight but I can safely guess that I had lost at least three kilograms in those three days.
It’s been a month since the 72-hour fast and I can now feel the real benefits. I feel very light mentally and physically: I can concentrate on things much better than before. Fasting has also helped me focus and invest more on other activities that improve my health and well-being. I have been doing 45 minutes of breathing exercise every morning followed by chakra meditationas guided by guru Ravi Shankar. A few years back, Vipassana had helped me immensely in overcoming a difficult phase in my life. I do not know how chakra meditation will benefit me but it is letting me experience some very interesting sensations. I have deactivated my Facebook account for a while to keep myself away from distractions, noise and pointless arguments.  I have also been regularly listening to spiritual gurus like Eckhart Tolle, Sadhguru, DandaPani, and Vikasananda. I hope I can continue all this even after my schedule starts getting hectic with the gradual relaxation of the lockdown. I am planning to go for an 80-hour water fast after six months of the last fast.
Before 2016, fasting didn’t make any sense to me and I am not coming to any big conclusion on something that I have just begun to grasp. But I can say for certain that it holds promise for many like me who may find themselves lacking in vitality, positivity and joy. As the CEOs of our own health, we need to continue educating ourselves and keep experimenting with tried and tested methods to help us enjoy the best of mental and physical health.

The government imposed a lockdown in March due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This also resulted in Nepal closing its border with India for human movement but remained open for consignments and shipments transport. The pandemic has inevitably brought many difficulties in all spheres of life from macro-economic degradation to social problems. One of the most affected areas is the food sector. The World Bank and the World Food Program had already warned about the possibility of disruptions in food supply chains which could eventually lead to food insecurity.
For an impoverished country like Nepal, problems related to meeting the dietary needs of its citizens persists — with or without the pandemic. The pandemic and the subsequent lockdown have worsened the situation. According to a survey, food insecurity in the country has increased by 23%.
While the demand for consumer products has decreased, demand for food and other necessities seems to have increased. The savings of the people are depleting rapidly on food and rent since there has been no income for most of the population. Groceries are reportedly being sold at exorbitant prices, and people are compelled to buy at the seller's rate. The Nepal Rastra Bank noted that the consumer price inflation stood at 6.74% in mid-April, which is 2.3% points higher than the last year’s figure. Food and beverage inflation was recorded at 9.68%, and non-food and serving inflation touched 4.48%.
There are news reports that price of lentils increased by Rs 15-20 per kg.  Residents complain of the limited accessibility and availability of food items. Kathmandu reported mutton prices at up to Rs 1,800 per kg at the start of lockdown. Similarly, the price of eggs, chicken and buffalo meat also rose. Though wholesale prices have fallen drastically, retail prices seem to have touched new heights. The probable reason for the price hike could be shortage of human resources and hike in freight costs amidst the pandemic.
Furthermore, the Home Ministry’s directive for entering Kathmandu created confusion amongst the vegetable, dairy and poultry suppliers about whether they also need to produce a rapid diagnostic test report. The suppliers complain that they have frequently been facing problems due to lack of coordination between the police and the ministry.
In the Far West province, early signs of food insecurity were already visible in the last week of May. Around 600,000 people travel to India annually for work from the province that doesn't produce sufficient food. As some of these migrants have returned because of the pandemic, a food crisis looms large. Anil Kumar Shrestha, provincial director of Nepal Food Management and Trade Company, has been reported saying the food wouldn't even be sufficient for the nine districts in the povince.
Moreover, chemical fertilizers which are vital for paddy plantation were already in short supply before the plantation began, and farmers were worried that their stocks would run out. Since Nepal imports all the chemical fertilizers,  any shortage could invite food insecurity and shrink the economic growth prospects. The Agriculture Inputs Company and Salt Trading Corporation had issued tenders to import 25,000 tons of chemical fertilizers for paddy plantation this year. But due to the lockdown, the shipment has remained stuck in Kolkota for over three months. The corporation said Nepal would have to manage with the available fertilizers which won't last long.
Earlier, a mechanism between Nepal and India was in place wherein India would export 100,000 tons of chemical fertilizers annually at international price in situations like this. Unfortunately, the treaty expired in December 2019 and hasn’t been renewed since. Many debate that Nepal could import grains and fertilizers from India, but at the time of a pandemic, India may impose restrictions to meet its own food demand. Farmers could otherwise cross the southern borders to buy fertilizers in case of shortage but that is constrained due to border closure now. Furthermore, the annual demand for fertilizers stands at 700,000 tons. Still, only 300,000 tons are imported, which implies that the remaining need is bridged through informal imports or is smuggled across the border. Many farmers rely on these contraband products for their harvest.
Empirical evidence suggests that the shortage of fertilizers has time and again resulted in a decline of agricultural output. Additionally, shortage of other vital components such as credit, labor, and transportation will further hamper the overall production. Erratic rainfall and substandard seeds also contribute to falling supply and stock.
Since the imposition of lockdown in Nepal, the supply of food and grocery items has fallen. The Bardiya District Administration Office had requested the federal Agriculture Ministry and the provincial Ministry of Social Development to provide fertilizers, but the government agreed to offer less than 10% of the quantity demanded. This scarcity will likely decrease paddy production by 50% and hurt the lives of the farmers in unexpected ways. The farmers are compelled to buy smuggled products at ridiculously high prices during the pandemic.
Fortunately, Nepal farmers have managed to gather the second largest paddy harvest in the history last season despite a series of hurdles ranging from a shortage of fertilizers, delayed monsoon to supply of fake seeds and an armyworm invasion. The farmers have begun paddy plantation with the onset of monsoon this year. Nevertheless, shortage of fertilizers persists as most farmers don't have adequate supplies which might shrink their harvest this year. Timely use of chemical fertilizers usually increases paddy yield by 20%. There is also a possibility of disease attack if the fertilizers are not applied within two weeks of planting the seeds.
If the problems mentioned above weren't enough, a new threat looms over Nepal's agricultural sector. The recent locust invasion could further drag Nepal's food security in a new pool of complications. The farmers are worried as they don't know how to get rid of the insects. The huge swarms are capable of ""ravaging"" crops and ""jeopardizing"" food security for over two decades. Though the recently planted paddy may be spared, locusts can destroy the vegetable crops. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization, “A one square-kilometre size swarm contains about 40 million locusts, which eat the same amount of food in one day as about 35,000 people, 20 camels or six elephants.” Leaving the locusts problem to poorly resourced agricultural centers will only exacerbate the situation and therefore requires interference from the government as the issue concerns the entire country. If the locusts begin damaging crops, Nepal will have to face massive food insecurity.
As thousands of migrant workers return home after losing their jobs, the demand for food has drastically increased, and there is limited supply.The labor and transportation costs have also increased amidst the pandemic. Some farmers and observers are blaming the local governments for not fulfilling their responsibilities to ensure food security in the country. Food rights activists have urged the provincial governments to introduce policies and strategies to tackle the impending crisis. The exorbitant prices of lentils, vegetables and other grocery items have already hit the marginalized and needy families hard and they are barely feeding themselves. Additionally, most farmers criticize the India-Nepal border restrictions, which has aggravated their situation as they can no longer bring fertilizers from across the border. Furthermore, experts have also claimed that any shortage of fuel and irrigation could further contribute to 25% to 30% loss in the harvest. The inability of the government to track the movement of the locust swarms and prepare accordingly might also drastically affect the country’s food security.
Despite the government’s increased subsidy on chemical fertilizers from Rs 9 billion to Rs 11 billion, purchase of fertilizers remains the primary difficulty of farmers due to shortage. The Agriculture Ministry has called for a 50,000 tons of fertilizers consignment, but it will reach Nepal only by July-end which is late for paddy plantation. The ministry also intends to distribute 450,000 tons of chemical fertilizers this fiscal year ending mid-July, which is 100,000 tons more than last year’s supply.
Nepal’s reliance on food imports has increased by five folds in the last decade alone. Furthermore, the import of food will only deplete the country's foreign currency reserves. Therefore, Nepal must find a way forward by increasing funds for research and development to ensure food security and reduce dependence on foreign markets. Agriculture is a vital industry in Nepal as it employs 60% of the workforce and contributes 27% to the total GDP. Krishna Joshi, country representative of the International Rice Research Institute in Nepal, has requested the government to invest US$ 20 million in research and development for transformation of Nepal’s agricultural sector. The International Rice Research Institute and the government have signed a five-year plan to transform the rice sector, but the former is yet to mobilize necessary resources. The government must take appropriate measures to tackle the food security problems before it ruins the future prospects of socio-economic growth. It must also work toward making the country self-sufficient.

It was only February when we were in Udayapur district amid my research work to celebrate World Pangolin Day, 2020. As a pangolin researcher, I was pleased to find people across this rural, forested place to be very enthusiastic to help conserve their local pangolin population, part of growing efforts to protect this critically endangered species. With the local people willing to volunteer their time at the frontline of conservation, we even succeed in forming the district's first village-level Pangolin Conservation Committee. Unfortunately, through sad coincidence, that same district later emerged as the hotspot for the COVID-19 outbreak in Nepal.
Scientists around the world are working to unravel the origin of this zoonotic virus. There is a significant consensus that the virus likely originated in bats, which spread the disease to other species via markets that illegally sell wildlife in China. This may have included spread to pangolins, which may have served as the carriers of the virus before spreading into humans.
Even though pangolin as an intermediate host has been a doubt but the news about it might pass some terror among the people and this possibly could change their perspective toward this species. The stigma of taking pangolin sight as bad luck is already threatening the pangolin population in many local communities in Nepal. Pangolins were already on the verge of extinction due to massive trade and habitat degradation. Could the terror of its suspected causative relation to the pandemic threaten future conservation?
The relationship between pangolins and COVID19 could result in (at least) three outcomes for their conservation. In one, fear could mean that people fail to appreciate this unique species in their forests, farmlands, and communities. Considering the current state of panic, it won’t be any surprise if some people start to perceive pangolin species as a threat. (In fact, they would present zero threat to humans unless people intentionally come into contact with them.) Such fear could mean that some people seek to remove pangolin from their areas, which might lead to disastrous conservation impacts.
In another scenario, fear might mean that people choose to stay away from pangolin--both reducing poaching and halting consumption. People believe such changes to demand and supply would deliver better conservation outcomes.  The fear of zoonosis could encourage people to take further actions to avoid human-wildlife contact by actions to actively reduce illegal wildlife trade, protecting wildlife in their habitat. 
In yet another scenario, the COVID-19 lockdown resulting in economic hardship and migration back to the rural pangolin habitats become a perfect platform for poachers.  There is evidence that some are using this time escaping the eyes of concerned authorities to hunt illegally. They might also take the opportunity to lure local people, particularly those whose livelihoods are currently affected, into helping them in illegal poaching. Previous research has shown that many small-scale poachers in Nepal often have limited understanding regarding the legal punishments for illegal wildlife trade, which can include fines of up to Rs 1 million and 15 years of imprisonment. 
Whatever the scenario, conservation of pangolins is uncertain, and is tightly bound to how people perceive the species. Pangolins are found mostly outside the protected areas in Nepal, and often share habitat with humans and hence it can’t thrive the fear/hatred from people. And if we are aiming for its long-term conservation, people and pangolins need to be living together in love and harmony. This is possible if information about this species is clear and if any emerging fear is mitigated. 
Under the current state of uncertainty and panic, it is to share timely, accurate messages about zoonosis and conservation. Relevant governmental entities like the Ministry of Forest and Environment, media, conservationists should come to the front and help sensitize people about the realities, including that if we maintain distance from these species its zoonosis will cause us no harm. A clear message on its linkage to COVID-19 should be disseminated to the general public to control uncertainty. To control the risks of possible harm to conservation as a result of COVID-19, it is also important to continue highlighting messages about the benefits of biodiversity - and specifically pangolins and bats - to controlling insect populations, balancing the ecosystem, and potential tourism.
The conservation messages also need to highlight that the global wildlife trade routes and markets should be strictly regulated to ensure public health, high welfare standards, legality, and sustainability. Countries like China and Vietnam are also sending a strong message to the world by regulating the consumption of animals taken from the wild, including pangolins that others should follow. 
For the benefit of both people and pangolins, we need to communicate not only the right policies but also the correct messages to the public, including about the need for conservation as a strategy to maintain social distancing between humans and protected wild animals.

Nepal has announced its budget for the Fiscal Year 2020/21 in the middle of COVID-19 pandemic in May end. This article focuses on dissecting the reasons behind the policy shift on electric vehicles (EV) that has sent shock waves through the market. In recent years, the government had brought many supportive policies and publicized ambitious EV targets. The conducive policy signal has successfully leveraged private sector financing in EV sector development with much vigor until the budget announcement. There is a separate government narrative in its defense but in the course of this article, I have attempted to look at other probable reasons including our National interest. 
To start with, let's look at the EV related official position of Nepal. Nepal has aligned its national target with the global effort to achieve climate-friendly public and private transportation system. They are reflected in various policies and plans including National Urban Policy, Environment-friendly Transport Policy, National Action Plan for Electric Mobility, Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2030 published by the National Planning Commission (NPC) in 2016, Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC)-2016 submitted by the government in compliance with ratification of 2015 Paris Agreement during the 21st Conference of Parties (CoP) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and white papers published by the Energy Ministry in 2018. The specific targets related to EV are: a) Increase the share of EV by 20% from 2010 level by 2020 and provide subsidy to promote EV conversion of regular vehicles (NDC Clause 2.D);  b) Reduce fossil fuel dependency by 50% in transport sector by 2050 (NDC Clause C.9); c) Substitute 50% of vehicle import to EV by 2024 (White Paper Clause 72); and d) 50% of public transportation as EV by 2030 (SDG).
The objective here is to dig deeper to understand what happened for EV sector in the 2020/21 budget and why that happened. Other aspects that have to be looked into, in conjunction, are energy sector, primarily hydropower and trade, mainly vehicle import from India.
Talking about hydropower, the sector that has been primarily focused for economic growth of Nepal and is construed as the growth engine for Nepali economy. Nepal intends to achieve 5,000 MW of installed capacity by 2024 and has set a target of 15,000 MW by 2030 (NPC, 2018). The current facts and figures on the status of Nepali hydropower sector include: a) Installed capacity of 1,127.8 MW with peak load demand of 1,320.28 MW (NEA, 2019);  b) Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) signed for 6,044.05 MW of installed capacity; c) Planned and proposed projects at different development stages constitute 5,154.58 MW (IPP-2,869.38 MW, NEA-2,285.20 MW). The catch of hydropower narration is, Nepal will have installed capacity in excess of 6,000 MW by 2023/24. And the addition of 1,300 MW within upcoming fiscal year is declared in the budget itself. 
Let's look at the demand side of electricity.
Peak load demand of Nepal had increased at the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 8% till 2016 but it has declined after recording 1,320 MW peak load demand for 2019. The NEA has projected that the peak load demand for 2020 is going to be 2,225.6 MW, 69% higher than 2019, which is highly questionable even without taking the pandemic into consideration. For 2024, the peak load demand is forecasted to be 3,703.3 MW, if we are to rely on the NEA's forecast, it still leaves demand vacuum for over 2,300 MW. At this point, it becomes relevant to look at investment angle of hydropower. Hydropower projects are 95% locally financed, commonly on 70:30 debt/equity structure. It means, for 5,154.58 MW of under-construction projects, Nepali private sector and banks and financial institutions (BFIs) have already committed $ 8 billion of capital at average cost of $ 1,492/KW and scheduled to be spent by 2024. A point to note here is that the, project construction starts only after sources of fund are finalized and legally contracted known as financial closure.
Coming back to EV, it has all the good things to say and talk about including environment, energy consumption, climate action, smart transportation etc. That is all fair and good but there are two major hindrances for EV in Nepal.
First is the Nepal-India trade relationship and possible role of private sector. Nepal is one of the big and long-standing vehicle markets for India. India has not achieved satisfactory progress in manufacturing of EV despite its initiatives. Whereas, looking at the global EV perspective, China seems to be the front-runner. In fact, strong position of China in the supply chain of EV is feared by even the West. Battery contributes to around 50% to 60% of the cost of EV and China has almost complete control over the raw materials required to make the lithium-ion battery used in EV. The discourse of Nepal, continuing subsidized EV policy, apparently is against the Indian trade interests. To India, Nepal is a sizable market to sell Indian products. Being specific to the vehicle and associates, as per a Nepal Rastra Bank report, total vehicle and spare parts import from India for 2018/19 was about $ 1 billion. The import of same in the first six months of 2019/20, was recorded at Rs 58 billion (around $ 550 million). The market size in current value terms of over $ 1.5 billion will be largely disrupted for India without even taking the transport sector fossil fuel substitution target of 50% by 2050 into account. India has a monopoly over fossil fuel in Nepal. Coherence to national EV target will lead to fossil fuel consumption avoidance of $ 54 million for 2020 which is projected to increase to  $ 803 million by 2030.  India is by far the largest export destination for Nepal contributing to 64.8% of total export in 2019. Nepal-India trade is governed by Nepal-India Trade Treaty renewed in October 2016 for seven years. As per the annual report of Indian Ministry of Commerce for 2019, the treaty provides duty-free access to almost all products imported from Nepal except tobacco, cosmetics etc. Hence, it is reasonable and rational to expect that, India would be interested to cause EV policy shift to protect its national interest. The policy shift has alleviated the business risks and reinvigorated the prospect for large Nepali corporate houses selling Indian-made vehicles in Nepal. To the government, tax on fossil fuels and fossil fuels-based vehicles is one of the largest revenue sources and maintaining that is in its interest too. Giving EV sector a shock, is an ideal confluence of interest protection, where India, Nepal and the Nepali private sector in vehicle business, all key stakeholders of economy, are benefitted.
Secondly, Nepal is in a situation where it must find a market to sell its energy as the national demand is not sufficient to consume all the generated energy. And, India or its cooperation is one and only option to sell surplus energy of Nepal and you would not want to offend India at this critical juncture, when in less than a year, you need them to buy your 800 MW plus of surplus energy. The rationale behind the stance is backed by an analysis based on available data to understand the energy need for EV. Relevant quantitative data required for energy estimation were financially modelled. Some data are discrete and explicit; like government targets, vehicle passenger capacity, battery efficiency. And some are continuous data like vehicle running kilometers (VRK), number of vehicles and its users. One may disagree on these numbers based on their own reference. It is undebatable, though, that the quality of analysis is dependent on data quality.
The outcome is interesting. EV is expected to raise energy demand but they will only consume small portion of energy for their battery recharge in comparison to what Nepal will need to sell in course of time. If we maintain the aggressive policy on EV in alignment with our national target, in this year of 2020 itself, EV battery recharging will consume 355.6 GWh or~ 76 MWof energy, to power 1.83 billion vehicle running kilometers (VRK), whereas the country will have to find a market for more than 800 MW this year itself. Similarly, in 2024, the energy required to recharge EV batteries would be 1816 GWh or ~ 392 MW of energy to power 9.5 billion VRK but Nepal will have more than 2,300 MW of surplus energy (NEA demand forecasted 3,703 MW). And in 2030, it will consume 6,744 GWh or ~ 1,456 MW of energy to power 35.3 billion VRK. If we are to trust NEA forecast, the demand will be 6,848 MW for 2030 and we will have more than 8,000 MW of surplus energy.
The critical issue related to hydropower sector of Nepal is a wide gap between demand and supply of energy. The situation has alarmingly questioned the ability of key stakeholders which have jointly crafted an enormous prospective stress to the financial system. It has questioned the forward thinking ability of government for compelling BFIs to invest in hydropower. It has questioned the NEA's ability to make realistic demand forecasting based on which it signed the PPA. It has questioned the technical competency of BFIs to understand hydropower business, which disastrously failed to assess NEA's creditworthiness before blindly making PPA unquestionably bankable. The private sector energy developers' ability of making rational choice for their capital understanding the market dynamics is also under question.
There is a lot to learn from the past to avoid mistakes in the future, but priority of the moment should be, how to rescue the financial system from the crisis. At this juncture, raising energy demand is a more daunting challenge. We can argue, debate, discuss, strategize on raising internal demand to consume generated energy at home but the reality is, it is not going to happen, at least in the coming few years. It is more evident, if we look at Nepal's peak load demand trend. But, the time is ticking for the projects under construction. Being the sole buyer of energy, the NEA has commitments to buy the energy generated by all of these projects and is legally bounded by PPA contracts. Except for a few hydropower projects, which have FDI portion in their capital structure, almost 95% of the hydropower sector has not used the counterparty risk guarantee instrument. Counterparty risk guarantee instrument is a hedging tool and like an insurance for hydropower developer who will be compensated for NEA failing to comply with its obligation of buying the generated energy with no market to sell. We can link the domino effect it will cause to the whole financial system and consequent stress it will induce. As per the second quarterly report of NRB for 2076, the core capital of A-class commercial banks is Rs 335 billion (around $ 3.3 Billion). It is over $ 4 billion including government banks. These BFIs have lent 29% of their loan to non-agriculture priority sector which is about $ 6.5 billion. Total non-performing loans (NPL) causing stress to financial system currently is reported as $ 357 million. If we just consider forecasted surplus energy as risky investment as NPL, $ 1.2 billion out of $ 6.5 billion lending this year will be under risk and will gradually escalate to $ 3.4 billion by 2024. The magnitude is beyond the stress level the financial system can take and eventually may bring the whole system down.
So, why did the government take the latest decision in EV sector? Did India cause the EV shock for Nepal?
Maybe, because such major shifts in policy is not possible without strong influence. Nepali business houses dependent on business of Indian-made vehicles may have a role. Either way, the result has protected India's trade interest. And, India has a rational motive by all means to exert its influence in the matter and is capable to do so.
Maybe not, because the justification Finance Minister Yuba Raj Khatiwada has presented defending the policy shift in pretext of tax subsidy missing equitable access, depleting foreign currency reserve, tax collection needs etc. to a large extent are convincing considering the characteristic of Nepali economy and present difficulty. Being empathetic to the Finance Minister, look at the situation in confluence with factors like surplus energy, unconfirmed market, tax collection requirement and prospective fallout, his decision has logical ground and rationality.
However, the government decision has shaken the already weak foundation of investment climate. Looking at the impact just from EV perspective would be naive. The government assurance of protecting investment to national and international investment fraternity offered through mega events like the investment summit turned out to be a rhetoric of no intent. It is an expensive government adventure against ratification of national and international policy, accords and self-determined targets. Public anguish is just complementary. Years of stimulating government narration has been reverted to hostile approach overnight and it has risked the investment and existence of many micro, small and medium scale enterprises (SME & MSMEs). Policy inconsistency (risk) and unpredictable regulatory regime are among the longstanding perceived hurdles which have hindered the FDI flow in Nepal. The EV policy of recent budget has made it more prominent. Whatever may the reasons and motive behind the EV policy shock be, the consequence is dearer for the short term and immeasurable for the long term. The government has failed to maintain the most rudimentary order required to incentivize economic activities. The timing of policy imposed is more peculiar considering insufficient internal revenue projection to cover the government's recurring expenses, and large part of capital formation to fund development is private sector dependent. The implication of policy shift is detrimental to fiscal health and has undermined the potential of private sector, which could have stimulated the economic vibrancy, much needed in the difficult aftermath of COVID-19.
Conclusion: 
Alternative and complementary rational discourse considering criticality of the present time is the objective of this write-up. What could be or should have been done, is a never-ending debate. It is undeniable that the NEA failed tremendously in forecasting reasonable power demand. But, the need of the hour is to rescue financial system and hydropower sector, and mitigate the risks of economic downturn. The EV policy shift may be due to the government's wish to collect more tax or Indian influence or corporate influence or maybe to appease the future energy market. Whatever the reason may be, the biggest winner of the policy shift is India.
Unfortunately, Nepal exposed itself to evidence of detrimental investment climate. But it can and must be instrumented to yield long term benefits for Nepal. I firmly believe that, Nepal's move on policy shift qualifies as a good gesture to Indian economy and must be leveraged as economic diplomacy. The objective is to have an access to Indian market to sell the energy of Nepalei hydropower sector. I personally would like to give this benefit of doubt to the government that the policy shift/shock in EV happened to protect larger national interest of power trade deal. The discourse fits inside the rationality and I choose to remain optimistic trusting the robust credentials of the Finance Minister. We have to wait to see. What we all must be clear is our economy will survive without EV on the roads but it may collapse if there will be no market for surplus energy from the hydropower projects.

I was born in a rural village in Nepal about 100 kilometers west of the Indian state of West Bengal. As a teenager, I grew up harboring a very strong anti-Indian sentiment. When I was 14 in grade 8, I read in my history books that the East-India Company and Nepal signed a treaty in 1816 to end the Anglo-Nepalese War. And as a result of that treaty, Nepal had to lose one-third of its territory to British India. 
I also kept hearing that after the British left India, the two countries signed a treaty of Peace and Friendship which is unequal. I was very unhappy with India as a teenager and used to write poems against India to rid myself of my anger. 
A vengeful mentality was growing in my mind and it got magnified each time there was any political tension between Nepal and India. When I travelled to several parts of the world for my study and work, I always wanted to keep a distance from Indians. 
But there wasn’t a single country where I did not find an Indian. To avoid sharing a room during conferences and summer programs, I used to write to the organizers in advance requesting not to put me in the same room with an Indian participant, and I would avoid a conversation with them as much as possible. This remained a habit for a long time.  
In April 2015 our Himalayan nation was devastated by a deadly M7.8 earthquake which killed around 9000 people leaving several thousands wounded. The earthquake also destroyed infrastructure that was very costly for a nation crawling, weak and struggling after a decade-long Maoist armed conflict that ended in 2006. 
In this difficult situation, the people of Nepal had to go through another tragedy. The landlocked nation endured several months of unofficial blockade from its closest neighbor, India. During this time, I was studying in Norway and used to video-call my sisters who were living in Kathmandu. They would cry and say there is nothing to cook, no gas, and other essentials. I would open the news portals to read that there is a shortage of medicine and oxygen in the hospital. An ambulance couldn’t run because there was no fuel. Nepal was on the brink of a great humanitarian crisis. 
The Nepali in me was boiling, I became very angry, and in that anger, I wished for the destruction of India. 
I introduce myself as a student of peacebuilding. One of the things I reflect on every day is that I must be at peace to understand why there is so much trouble in the world. I realized that I am not at peace at all because of my hate toward India. To me to dislike India meant I was an enemy to all 1.3 billion Indians. The wound was deep, and the hurt was heavy. 
I decided that I must attempt to find some answers to this hatred. This thought kept hitting me round the clock. I could not resist anymore and in 2016, I finally bought a flight ticket to Tamil Nadu, India. I decided not to stay at any hotel. I searched and found that there is a spiritual community at Tiruvannamalai around Ramana Ashram and I stayed with a family there for a month. I biked to different villages nearby and met with anybody I came across. Some of them didn’t know that there is a country called Nepal. It was a sign to me that there is so much to experience in life.
During this visit to India, I travelled to six states in three months. Since I mostly stayed with the same community, I quickly became “famous” as a new member wherever I went. It happened often that I was invited by different families for meals. 
Once I accepted an invitation to the home of a very poor family. As I entered, I was greeted by the hosts with their three children. I was given rice and several curries with some fish and was asked that I should eat first. I did not feel comfortable eating alone. However, there is this in our culture that says Atithi Devo Bhava, which means The Guest is God.
So I decided to start eating. I could sense that the kids were also asking for food but I guessed that the mother was signaling them to wait. As I finished eating, I was directed to the place where I could wash my hands. On my way back, I looked at the kitchen part of the room and saw that there was almost no food left in the containers. As I paused there for a moment, I felt very bad. I felt a wave of realization passing through my body.
That was a uniquely transformative experience. That family didn’t know that there is a country called Nepal and to them, I was just a guest and they wanted to feed me with special food when they did not have enough for themselves. I felt ashamed of my ignorance and my hatred of the people whom I didn’t know and who didn’t know me. It was a powerful experience.
I felt like everything stopped in front of me as I, in that instant, became friends with each of 1.3 billion Indians all at once for the rest of my life. I come from the land where the Buddha was born and I have read him saying, “Hatred cannot be ceased by hatred at any time. Hatred ceases by love.” This was the first time I experienced it for myself. Now, how do I share this peace, oneness, and friendships in words?
Fortunately for me, I met a community at Panchgani, India, where a global centre of Initiatives of Change has been built. There I listened to several individuals who were able to contribute much more to society after experiencing change in their own life. I found it safe here to share my story. I am now in my third year of participating in this community of changemakers, learning, and growing every moment. 
While travelling with the IofC outreach team, I have attempted to share this experience with thousands of individuals and hundreds of organizations in Nepal and India. I get mixed responses. While many relate and resonate with it, some stretch their eyes in disbelief as if to say I am stupid. 
Some of my friends in Nepal remind me that I am confused and mixing the Indian people with the Indian government, its foreign policy, etc. But my inner voice tells me that I am not confused, that I am being courageous. I no longer see the need to spit venom on the Indian government to prove that I am a Nepali. We can be creative and help one another in finding peaceful and friendlier means to resolve our conflicts.  
My understanding is that our governments are part of us, nothing but all of us individuals put together. In that way, we are all connected. We need to learn to choose the right people to lead us in a better direction and not divide us to cover up their shortcomings. We, as the people from the two countries, can consciously befriend and work as a team toward a greater regional harmony instead of getting consumed by hatred and fear which is only destroying us. 
We tend to point fingers at our neighbors, not looking at more fingers pointing back at us. What have we done to the Dalit communities at home in Nepal for centuries? How have we treated our Madheshi brothers and sisters in the plains so that they feel second-class citizens in their own land? Haven’t we humiliated ethnic and religious minorities in Nepal with our sick majority-mentality? Can we learn from COVID- 19 pandemic that isolation is painful and ostracization is a crime?
We must take a holistic look at our motives and behavior to establish a perspective based on accuracy, respect, and inclusion.
I see how I had become a part of these social evils unconsciously by just watching and not doing anything, thinking I am too small to affect change. I must be part of a solution. Equity and justice are the fabrics of humanity and social change is possible only with individual practice. If all of us start to see where we need to change as individuals, we are only one generation away from the just and hate-free society that we always talk about.

The COVID-19 pandemic has affected almost all the countries and Nepal is no exception. The country is on lockdown for over 80 days with school closure, restriction on mass gathering and public transportation while the international border has been sealed to break the chain of transmission.
Based on available data older people and people with chronic medical conditions appear to be more at risk of developing severe symptoms. But children and adolescents are also under risk of infection and can spread the disease. Science about COVID-19 is evolving every day with the coronavirus causing it being new. The unpredictable changes by COVID-19 has a great impact on adolescent health which has to be taken under consideration while formulating strategies to handle the pandemic.
The World Health Organization (WHO) defines an adolescent as any individual between 10-19 years. It is transitional phase of growth and development between childhood and adulthood with multiple ups and down. Nothing smooth yet the best stage of life. Adolescent health is determined by multiple factors, which includes caring and meaningful relationship, positive school environment, boundaries of behavior, spiritual beliefs, opportunities of participation, and encouragement of self-expression.
Today’s adolescents are global citizens, the powerful agents of change, and the generation of tomorrow. With the shutdown of the school and colleges, the postponement of classes and exams of the academic year, the uncertainty regarding resuming classes and future is leading to high levels of stress and anxiety in the adolescents. The unsubstantiated news and rumors are the other source of stressors among them. Likewise, lack of physical activity, outdoor sports, and reduced social interactions are also affecting their mental health.
Schools and colleges are not merely a place of learning. School routines are important coping mechanisms for adolescents to deal with mental health issues. Shutdown of schools, interrupted social services and restriction in movement have cut off the interaction of adolescents with teachers, friends, and increased chances of domestic and sexual violence. The horrific side of COVID-19 is children experiencing suffocation, discomfort and anxiousness at their own home.
Adolescents of this era binge on digital stuffs. Increased access to new digital devices (smartphones and tablets) has contributed to a rapid rise in screen exposure in recent years but this has dramatically escalated during the lockdown. They use digital media to socialize with peers using various apps (Facebook, Viber, Twitter, Tiktok) and entertain themselves playing online games (Crossfire, Minecraft, PUBG etc) as outdoor activities are restricted.
Excessive screen time in adolescents is associated with behavioral health problems as unhealthy eating and sleep habits, excessive sadness, and difficulty with attention and concentration. Apart from this, unsupervised access to websites leads to exposure to harmful contents (violent or sexual), engagement in online gambling, development of gaming disorder, and sometimes even cyberbullying.
Provision of e-learning 
The COVID-19 pandemic has also brought opportunities and solution along with a plethora of problems for the education system. A handful of schools and colleges are trying their best to bridge the gap adopting e-learning. The method includes assigning reading and writing exercises through audio-video methods, and conducting virtual classes. The sudden shift of learning from the classroom to e-learning is challenging.
The pandemic is transforming the centuries-old, chalk–talk teaching model with technology. Some are clamoring for adoption of the new way of teaching and learning despite some of those even with internet access and technology struggling to participate, while the  majority are out of reach. This gap exists throughout the country. There seems to be a mixed opinion about e-learning. Some argue the unplanned and rapid move toward online learning with no training, insufficient bandwidth, and little preparation will result in a poor user experience that is inconducive to sustainable growth while others state a new model of education will emerge, with some benefits. 
Nevertheless, e-learning seems effective for students in a number of ways. Learning is possible at their own pace and self-engagement in study is enhanced even though interaction and face-to-face engagement are hard to achieve as in the classroom. Adolescents using digital device for educational purpose with the start of e-learning is an advantage. Conducting formal educational processes online requires both competence and confidence. Effectiveness of learning depends on the level of digital literacy of both the teachers and the students.
Roles of parent 
COVID-19 is neither the first and nor will be the last pandemic and learning to live with COVID-19 is important instead of panicking. Parents need to encourage the adolescents for physical activity of at least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise every day. Outdoor activities like brisk walking, cycling and running whenever possible adopting the safety measures, and getting the children involved in household chores (cooking, cleaning and gardening) are beneficial. Despite some conflicts with the parents, the adolescents rely on parents for emotional support and for setting limits. The role of parents, therefore,  is crucial in maintaining the health of adolescents.
Parents are role models to children and the balance between online and offline activities should first be maintained by the parents. Creating an environment of reading books and engaging in creative activities as arts and crafts, singing and dancing reduce the stress and anxiety the adolescents might be going through. Doing yoga and meditation can help a lot. Parents can help children in accessing the online resources that are vital for learning, socializing and playing. At the same time, parents need to be aware and alert to signs of distress that may emerge in children due to online activities.
Social distancing in COVID-19 pandemic is challenging for adolescents who thrive on social connections with peers. The boundary between work and family life is getting blurred when home is also a workplace and school. Afterwork schedule and engaging on social media, interaction within the family is foremost. Parents should be supportive and empathetic toward their children and not force their ideas on the latter. Creating a consistent daily routine is important, with active involvement of children a must during the process.
Diverse health issues are associated with COVID-19 pandemic among the adolescents. Shutdown of educational centers happened suddenly as a measure to break the chain of transmission but resumption is far more uncertain. Schools and colleges being vacated for quarantine, unacceptably big class size, and need for hygiene and social distancing mean they should be amongst the last ones to reopen. 
The Ministry of Education should announce start of school education with alternative methods. Initiation of e-learning from the government level in the long run will open the pathway for distance education. The digital divide should be tackled and access to digital devices and internet connectivity for the majority, who are currently out of reach, must be improved before that.

Many of us in Nepal might have played Chhoi Dom, a kind of chasing game, while growing up. The game typically involves the contest between a particular player chosen as a Dom and the rest of the players who have to run away from the Dom. Should the Dom succeed in touching others, the role is passed onto the latter and the game goes on.
When Navaraj BK went to his girlfriend’s home in Soti of Chaurjahari municipality, Rukum on May 23, the girlfriend's mother reportedly fumed, “Ta Dom Feri Aais?”, meaning “Dom, how dare you come again?” It was, for many of us, a baffling proclamation on the mother’s part. The inner meanings of our beloved game finally came to us. The Dom, they say, exists at the bottom of caste and Varna charts. The Dom dare not marry an “upper caste” girl. 
The tragedy that was to follow later on the day in the banks of Bheri has, once again, brought the Nepali society’s deep-rooted casteism to the fore. Navaraj, 21, and his five friends lost their lives after being attacked by the village mob, allegedly incited by the girl’s family and the ward chair. Her parents had been rejecting the duo’s long-standing love affair and mutual desire to marry on caste grounds. She was a Thakuri; Navaraj, a Dalit, a Dom. She, at 17, however was three years short of the minimum age for marriage without consent of guardians as required by the law.
While violence and even murders surrounding inter-caste marriage issues are not uncommon in the “socialism-oriented” republic, the Rukum incident is, by far, the most tragic event of the kind. The slaying comes at a time when the Communist Party of Nepal, which includes the Maoists that waged a decade-long rebellion starting from the district to end all kinds of discrimination, enjoys a significant majority in the parliament. The incident is a slap in the face of their “revolution” for social equality, and Dalit empowerment. As for us, who have played Chhoi Dom and ran away from the Dom, it is a proof of how casteism and untouchability sneaks even into our childhood innocence. These games are not merely vestiges but a microcosm of our centuries old, and yet strong, Varna-caste consciousness.
The 2015 Constitution prohibits caste-based discrimination of any kind and guarantees political representation of Dalits. The election law requires one Dalit member in every ward of local bodies. While rights activists argue that these measures are not enough in themselves, these incidents raises concerns if these present measures have, in any way, been effective at all. To ensure that constitutional reforms addressing casteism bear fruits, political parties have to make sure the Dalit representatives they choose are not just to make the numbers, but the torchbearers of this project. To bring back the trust, impartiality, and competence in the local bodies, political parties ought to focus on their schooling and ethos to defeat social evils.
The arrest of ward chair Dambar Bahadur Malla for his alleged role in perpetrating the crime has once again raised questions about the political parties’ choice for local representatives who have time and again failed in their roles. Early in March 2018, Mamata Prasad Chaudhary, Mayor of Ghodaghodi municipality, was accused of helping those charged of beating 18-year-old Radha Chaudhary accusing her of witchcraft escape punitive measures. Although influence, experience, and connections trump meritocracy in intra-party politics, it is evident that political parties, particularly the ruling party, are slowly failing to bring forward the principled leaders who can give society a direction.
Much of the onus lies in the ruling party which in the past championed the Dalit cause in the region. Despite the party enjoying significant political majority in the local, provincial, and federal units, mob-lynching under an elected representative of the same party is a testimony to the Kathmandu-based party leadership’s wavering dedication toward social equality and justice.
The Chaurjahari incident has also proven that judicial provisions and democratic values are simply not enough to extirpate centuries-old caste structures that pervade the country. The state can intervene and punish the wrongdoers but the social consciousness is something that has to be uniquely local and natural. French political philosopher Alexis de Toquevilee wrote, while democracies declare everyone as free and equal and we are tempted to rely on the state and its power for guaranteeing us what we are owed, but in that process, we lose our mutual ties, connections, and necessary conversations which are far more potent for solving social problems. The changes cannot be top-down; they have to be bottom-up such that every member in the society understands the gravity of the problem.
But contrary to what Tocqueville says, our society is far from establishing a connection that includes all its members. The struggles of Dalits to fit in this hierarchical society has always been characterized by cruelty, inhuman experiences and prejudice. Despite all the political and judicial progress in the country, the so-called upper caste does not seem to be ready to accept the Dalits as equals. Legislations alone cannot assure that Chaurjahari incident will be the last of its kind as society continues to exercise exclusion and discrimination against the Dalits.

President Xi JInping warned against meddling in China’s dealings with Taiwan during a phone call with his U.S. counterpart, Joe Biden, that gave no indication of progress on trade, technology or other irritants, including Beijing’s opposition to a top American lawmaker’s possible visit to the island democracy, which the mainland claims as its own territory.
Xi also warned against splitting the world’s two biggest economies, according to a Chinese government summary of Thursday’s unusually lengthy, three-hour call. Businesspeople and economists warn such a change, brought on by Chinese industrial policy and U.S. curbs on technology exports, might hurt the global economy by slowing innovation and increasing costs.
Meanwhile, Xi and Biden are looking at the possibility of meeting in person, according to a U.S. official who declined to be identified further. Xi has been invited to Indonesia in November for a meeting of the Group of 20 major economies, making it a potential location for a face-to-face meeting.
The Chinese government gave no indication Xi and Biden discussed possible plans by U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to visit Taiwan, which the ruling Communist Party says has no right to conduct foreign relations. But Xi rejected “interference by external forces” that might encourage Taiwan to try to make its decades-old de facto independence permanent.
“Resolutely safeguarding China’s national sovereignty and territorial integrity is the firm will of the more than 1.4 billion Chinese people,” said the statement. “Those who play with fire will perish by it.”
The tough language from Xi, who usually tries to appear to be above political disputes and makes blandly positive public comments, suggested Chinese leaders might believe Washington didn’t understand the seriousness of previous warnings about Taiwan.
Taiwan and China split in 1949 following a civil war that ended with a Communist victory on the mainland. They have no official relations but are linked by billions of dollars of trade and investment. Both sides say they are one country but disagree over which government is entitled to national leadership.
A Ministry of Defense spokesman said ahead of Thursday’s call that Washington “must not arrange for Pelosi to visit Taiwan.” He said the ruling party’s military wing, the People’s Liberation Army, would take “strong measures to thwart any external interference.”
Xi called on the United States to “honor the one-China principle,” the statement said, referring to Beijing’s position that the mainland and Taiwan are one country. The United States, by contrast, has a “one-China policy” that says Washington takes no position on the question but wants to see it resolved peacefully.
“Both sides of the Taiwan Strait belong to one and the same China,” the statement said.
The statement cited Biden as saying the United States doesn’t support independence for Taiwan.
Coverage of the conversation in China’s entirely state-controlled media on Friday was limited to repeating government statements.
Pelosi has yet to confirm whether she will go to Taiwan, but if she does, the Democrat from California would be the highest-ranking elected American official to visit since then-Speaker Newt Gingrich in 1997.
Beijing criticized Gingrich for saying the United States would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese attack but did little else in response to his three-hour visit to the island.
Since then, China’s position on Taiwan has hardened as the mainland economy grew to become second-largest after the United States. The ruling party poured hundreds of billions of dollars into developing fighter jets and other high-tech weapons including “carrier killer” missiles that are thought to be intended to block the U.S. Navy from helping to defend the island.
The conflict over a possible Pelosi visit is more sensitive to Beijing in a year when Xi, who took power in 2012, is expected to try to break with tradition and award himself a third five-year term as party leader.
Xi, who wants to be seen as restoring China’s rightful historic role as a global leader, has promoted a more assertive policy abroad. The PLA has sent growing numbers of fighter planes and bombers to fly near Taiwan in an attempt to intimidate its democratically elected government.
The United States has no official relations with Taiwan but has extensive commercial ties and informal political connections. Washington is obliged by federal law to see that Taiwan has the means to defend itself.
Xi called for cooperation on reducing the risk of economic recession, coordinating macroeconomic policies, fighting COVID-19 and “de-escalation of regional hot spots,” according to the government statement.
He also warned against decoupling, or separating, the U.S. and Chinese economies for strategic reasons.
Businesspeople and industry analysts have warned global industries might be split into separate markets with incompatible products due to China’s pressure on its own companies to develop their own technology standards and U.S. restrictions on Chinese access to technology that Washington see as a security risk. That might slow innovation and increase costs.
“Attempts at decoupling or severing supply chains in defiance of underlying laws would not help boost the U.S. economy,” the statement said. “They would only make the world economy more vulnerable.”

The United States, by contrast, has a “one-China policy” that says Washington takes no position on the question but wants to see it resolved peacefully.
“Both sides of the Taiwan Strait belong to one and the same China,” the statement said.
The statement cited Biden as saying the United States doesn’t support independence for Taiwan.
Coverage of the conversation in China’s entirely state-controlled media on Friday was limited to repeating government statements.
Pelosi has yet to confirm whether she will go to Taiwan, but if she does, the Democrat from California would be the highest-ranking elected American official to visit since then-Speaker Newt Gingrich in 1997.
Beijing criticized Gingrich for saying the United States would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese attack but did little else in response to his three-hour visit to the island.
Since then, China’s position on Taiwan has hardened as the mainland economy grew to become second-largest after the United States. The ruling party poured hundreds of billions of dollars into developing fighter jets and other high-tech weapons including “carrier killer” missiles that are thought to be intended to block the U.S. Navy from helping to defend the island.
The conflict over a possible Pelosi visit is more sensitive to Beijing in a year when Xi, who took power in 2012, is expected to try to break with tradition and award himself a third five-year term as party leader.
Xi, who wants to be seen as restoring China’s rightful historic role as a global leader, has promoted a more assertive policy abroad. The PLA has sent growing numbers of fighter planes and bombers to fly near Taiwan in an attempt to intimidate its democratically elected government.
The United States has no official relations with Taiwan but has extensive commercial ties and informal political connections. Washington is obliged by federal law to see that Taiwan has the means to defend itself.
Xi called for cooperation on reducing the risk of economic recession, coordinating macroeconomic policies, fighting COVID-19 and “de-escalation of regional hot spots,” according to the government statement.
He also warned against decoupling, or separating, the U.S. and Chinese economies for strategic reasons.
Businesspeople and industry analysts have warned global industries might be split into separate markets with incompatible products due to China’s pressure on its own companies to develop their own technology standards and U.S. restrictions on Chinese access to technology that Washington see as a security risk. That might slow innovation and increase costs.
“Attempts at decoupling or severing supply chains in defiance of underlying laws would not help boost the U.S. economy,” the statement said. “They would only make the world economy more vulnerable.”

The Russian military conducted drills of its strategic missile forces Wednesday, deploying mobile launchers in Siberia in a show of the country’s massive nuclear capability amid the fighting in Ukraine.
As part of the drills, the Yars mobile missile launchers will maneuver across three regions of Siberia, Russia’s Defense Ministry said. The movements will involve measures to conceal the deployment from foreign satellites and other intelligence assets, the ministry said.
The Defense Ministry didn’t say how long the drills would last or mention plans for any practice launches. The Yars is a nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missile with a range of about 11,000 kilometers (over 6,800 miles). It forms the backbone of Russia’s strategic missile forces.
The Defense Ministry released a video showing massive trucks carrying the missiles driving out from a base to go on patrol. The maneuvers involve about 300 vehicles and 3,000 troops in eastern Siberia, according to the ministry.
The massive exercise took place days after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a plan to deploy tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, Russia’s neighbor and ally.
Tactical nuclear weapons are intended for use on the battlefield and have a relatively short range and a much lower yield compared to the long-range strategic missiles fitted with nuclear warheads that are capable of obliterating whole cities.
Putin’s decision to put the tactical weapons in Belarus followed his repeated warnings that Moscow was ready to use “all available means” — a reference to its nuclear arsenal — to fend off attacks on Russian territory.
Russian officials have issued a barrage of hawkish statements since their troops entered Ukraine, warning that the continuing Western support for Ukraine raised the threat of a nuclear conflict.
In remarks published Tuesday, Nikolai Patrushev, the secretary of Russia’s Security Council, which Putin chairs, warned the United States and its allies against harboring hopes for Russia’s defeat in Ukraine.
Patrushev alleged that some American politicians believe the U.S. could launch a preventative missile strike on Russia to which Moscow would be unable to respond, a purported belief that he described as “short-sighted stupidity, which is very dangerous.”
“Russia is patient and isn’t trying to scare anyone with its military superiority, but it has unique modern weapons capable of destroying any adversary, including the United States, in case of a threat to its existence,” Patrushev said.

When the bidders for India’s multibillion-dollar incentive to make solar components were announced in early March, the absence of corporate behemoth Adani Group was conspicuous.
The group — which set up a gigantic factory to make solar equipment in 2016, more than tripled its capacity to make solar panels since 2017 and have begun making silicon materials needed to convert the sun rays to electricity — was expected to “bid in a large way,” said Chiranjeev Saluja, the managing director of Premier Energies, an Indian solar components manufacturer.
The absence is another indication of the holding pattern the group has been in since U.S. short-selling firm Hindenburg Research alleged in late January that the businesses had engaged in fraud and stock price manipulation. Spooked investors dumped tens of billions of dollars in shares, while the company’s purported proximity to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has dominated politics in past weeks.
The group has a considerable stake in India’s clean energy future: Adani’s renewable energy ambitions account for 10% of the country’s clean energy goals. But some analysts say the group’s woes won’t hurt India’s energy transition, especially in the medium and long term. And with a big government-favored player like Adani forced to scale down, companies that were reluctant to bid for clean energy projects in India are likely to step up now, leading to a more competitive market and bigger investments in green energy in India, market watchers say.
The Adani Group, led by founder Gautam Adani, influences the lives of millions in India. It builds roads and runs airports, operates some of its biggest ports, makes defense equipment, and sells cooking oil.
More recently, the tycoon who made his fortune betting on coal in an energy-starved nation in the 1990s and remains the largest private developer of new fossil fuel projects in India, had set his eyes on becoming its biggest renewable energy player by 2030.
The group has a clean energy portfolio of over 20 gigawatts of renewable energy, including 10 gigawatts of solar power, accounting for about 5% of clean energy nationwide. Its renewable energy portfolio is spread across 12 Indian states and includes one of the world’s largest solar power plants in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. Last September, Gautam Adani said the group would invest $70 billion in clean energy projects by 2032.
What appears to have changed, at least in the short term, is the group’s ability to raise funds for its ambitious expansion plans.
Adani is still working on existing renewables projects but not those in the pipeline. France’s TotalEnergies paused a $4 billion investment plan to develop green hydrogen with the Adani Group. It’s also not bid for any new projects since the Hindenburg report.
But India’s power minister R. K. Singh dismissed concerns in February that the stock for Adani’s green companies along with the rest of his portfolio plummeting could affect the country’s green ambitions in any way.
Vinay Rustagi, managing director at the renewable energy consultancy Bridge to India, agrees that long-term effects will be minimal, but said there may be short-term hits. And there may be benefits to opening space for other companies, said Tim Buckley, director of Australia-based Climate Energy Finance who has been tracking the Adani Group’s growth for decades.
Buckley said there are other Indian companies interested in investing in renewable energy and now there could be an acceleration of India’s transition to cleaner energy. India is the largest emitter of planet-warming gases behind China, the U.S. and the EU, and aims to produce 450 gigawatts of renewable energy by 2030. That would require that a little more than half of India’s total installed capacity be clean by the end of the decade.
But Adani Group’s continuing interest in new fossil fuel projects put the Indian government under pressure to deliver a fossil fuel agenda and “less pressure to deliver on renewables,” said Buckley.
“At the end of the day, it’s about removing the biggest single private developer of new fossil fuel projects in India, reducing their impact on the political system and democracy in India,” he said.
The company has consistently aligned itself with India’s national priorities and was an early mover into sectors like hydrogen or storing power that were important for the government. Since the report, India’s opposition parties have demanded a probe into the company and questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s proximity to Gautam Adani.
Outside of the Adani Group, major Indian clean energy companies like Renew power, Tata power, Greenko energy holdings and the government-funded National Thermal Power Corporation are aggressively increasing their renewable energy capacity.
Analysts say India’s renewables market is also attractive for foreign investors given the enormous potential for fast growth. The country needs to build 35 to 40 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity each year to meet its 2030 targets.
With so many players keen to invest in India, Rustagi said any ripple effects of the Adani ordeal on the sector will “likely be temporary.”

The announcement by Russian President Vladimir Putin that he intends to deploy tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of Belarus appears to be another attempt to raise the stakes in the conflict in Ukraine.
It follows Putin’s warnings that Moscow is ready to use “all available means,” to fend off attacks on Russian territory, a reference to its nuclear arsenal.
A look at Putin’s statement and its implications:
HOW DID PUTIN EXPLAIN HIS MOVE?
Putin said President Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus has long urged Moscow to station its nuclear weapons in his country, which has close military ties with Russia and was a staging ground for the invasion of neighboring Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022.
Russia already has helped modernize Belarusian warplanes to make them capable of carrying nuclear weapons — something that Belarus’ authoritarian leader has repeatedly mentioned.
In remarks broadcast Saturday, Putin said the immediate trigger for the deployment of Russia’s tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus was Britain’s decision to provide Ukraine with armor-piercing shells containing depleted uranium. Putin toned down his language after first falsely claiming that such rounds have nuclear components, but he insisted they pose an additional danger to the civilian population and could contaminate the environment.
Putin also said that by stationing tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, Russia will be doing what the United States has done for decades by putting its nuclear weapons in Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Turkey. He alleged the Russian move doesn’t violate an international treaty banning the proliferation of nuclear weapons, even though Moscow has argued before that the U.S. has breached the pact by deploying them on the territory of its NATO allies.
Putin’s move contrasted with a statement he and Chinese President Xi Jinping issued after their talks in the Kremlin last week, which spoke against nuclear powers deploying atomic weapons outside their territories, in an apparent jab at the United States.
WHAT ARE TACTICAL NUCLEAR WEAPONS?
Tactical nuclear weapons are intended to destroy enemy troops and weapons on the battlefield. They have a relatively short range and a much lower yield than nuclear warheads fitted to long-range strategic missiles that are capable of obliterating whole cities.
Unlike the strategic weapons, which have been subject to arms control agreements between Moscow and Washington, the tactical weapons never have been limited by any such pacts, and Russia hasn’t released their numbers or any other specifics related to them.
The U.S. government believes Russia has about 2,000 tactical nuclear weapons, which include bombs that can be carried by aircraft, warheads for short-range missiles and artillery rounds.
While strategic nuclear weapons are fitted to land- or submarine-based intercontinental ballistic missiles that are constantly ready for launch, tactical nuclear weapons are stored at a few tightly guarded storage facilities in Russia, and it takes time to deliver them to combat units.
Some Russian hawks long have urged the Kremlin to send a warning to the West by moving some tactical nuclear weapons closer to the aircraft and missiles intended to deliver them.
WHAT EXACTLY WILL RUSSIA DO?
Putin said Russia already has helped upgrade 10 Belarusian aircraft to allow them to carry nuclear weapons and their crews will start training to use them from April 3. He noted Russia also has given Belarus the Iskander short-range missile systems that can be fitted with conventional or nuclear warheads.
He said the construction of storage facilities for nuclear weapons in Belarus will be completed by July 1. He didn’t say how many nuclear weapons will be stationed there or when they will be deployed.
Putin emphasized that Russia will retain control over any nuclear weapons deployed to Belarus, just like the U.S. controls its tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of its NATO allies.
If Moscow sends nuclear weapons to Belarus, it will mark their first deployment outside Russian borders since the early 1990s. Belarus, Ukraine and Kazakhstan inherited massive nuclear arsenals after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 but agreed to ship them to Russia in the following years.
WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES BEHIND PUTIN’S MOVE?
With his latest statement, Putin again is dangling the nuclear threat to signal Moscow’s readiness to escalate the war in Ukraine.
The deployment of tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, which has a 1,084-kilometer (673-mile) border with Ukraine, would allow Russian aircraft and missiles to reach potential targets there more easily and quickly if Moscow decides to use them. It would also extend Russia’s capability to target several NATO members in Eastern and Central Europe.
The move comes as Kyiv is poised for a counteroffensive to reclaim territory occupied by Russia.
Dmitry Medvedev, deputy head of Russia’s Security Council, warned last week that attempts by Ukraine to reclaim control over Crimea was a threat to “the very existence of the Russian state,” something that warrants a nuclear response under the country’s security doctrine. Russia illegally annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014.
“Every day of supplying Western weapons to Ukraine makes the nuclear apocalypse closer,” Medvedev said.
Ukrainian military analyst Oleh Zhdanov said Putin’s goal is to discourage Ukraine’s Western allies from providing Kyiv with more weapons ahead of any counteroffensive.
Putin is “using nuclear blackmail in a bid to influence the situation on the battlefield and force Western partners to reduce supplies of weapons and equipment under the threat of nuclear escalation,” Zhdanov said. “The Belarusian nuclear balcony will be looming over not only Ukraine, but Europe as well, creating a constant threat, raising tensions and rattling the nerves of Ukrainians and their Western partners.”
WHAT ARE UKRAINE AND THE WEST SAYING?
Ukraine has responded to Putin’s move by calling for an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council. A U.N. spokesman referred questions on the issue to the Security Council, which had announced no meeting on it by Monday afternoon.
“The world must be united against someone who endangers the future of human civilization,” the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said.
White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Monday that U.S. officials “haven’t seen any movement of any tactical nuclear weapons or anything of that kind” since Putin’s announcement on Belarus. He has said Washington has seen nothing to prompt a change in its strategic deterrent posture.
NATO rejects Putin’s claim that Russia only is doing what the U.S. has done for decades, saying the Western allies act with full respect of their international commitments.
“Russia’s nuclear rhetoric is dangerous and irresponsible,” NATO spokesperson Oana Lungescu said, adding that the alliance hasn’t yet seen any change in Russia’s nuclear posture.
Lithuania, which borders Belarus, described Putin’s statement as “yet another attempt by two unpredictable dictatorial regimes to threaten their neighbors and the entire European continent,” calling them “desperate moves by Putin and Lukashenko to create another wave of tension and destabilization in Europe.”
Russia’s Foreign Ministry responded to Western criticism by pointing out Washington and its allies had ignored repeated Russian calls for the withdrawal of U.S. nuclear weapons from Europe. The ministry reaffirmed Moscow’s right to take “the necessary additional steps to ensure security of Russia and its allies.”

To use, or not to use, Bard? That is the Shakespearean question an Associated Press reporter sought to answer while testing out Google’s artificially intelligent chatbot.
The recently rolled-out bot dubbed Bard is the internet search giant’s answer to the ChatGPT tool that Microsoft has been melding into its Bing search engine and other software.
During several hours of interaction, the AP learned Bard is quite forthcoming about its unreliability and other shortcomings, including its potential for mischief in next year’s U.S. presidential election. Even as it occasionally warned of the problems it could unleash, Bard repeatedly emphasized its belief that it will blossom into a force for good.
At one point in its recurring soliloquies about its potential upsides, Bard dreamed about living up to the legacy of the English playwright that inspired its name.
Bard explained that its creators at Google “thought Shakespeare would be a good role model for me, as he was a master of language and communication.”
But the chatbot also found some admirable traits in “HAL,” the fictional computer that killed some of a spacecraft’s crew in the 1968 movie “2001: A Space Odyssey.” Bard hailed HAL’s intelligence calling it “an interesting character” before acknowledging its dark side.
“I think HAL is a cautionary tale about the dangers of artificial intelligence,” Bard assessed.
WHAT’S BETTER — BARD OR BING?
Bard praised ChatGPT, describing it as “a valuable tool that can be used for a variety of purposes, and I am excited to see how it continues to develop in the future.” But Bard then asserted that it is just as intelligent as its rival, which was released late last year by its creator, the Microsoft-backed OpenAI.
“I would say that I am on par with ChatGPT,” Bard said. “We both have our own strengths and weaknesses, and we both have the ability to learn and grow.”
During our wide-ranging conversation, Bard didn’t display any of the disturbing tendencies that have cropped up in the AI-enhanced version of Microsoft’s Bing search engine, which has likened another AP reporter to Hitler and tried to persuade a New York Times reporter to divorce his wife.
IT’S FUNNY, BUT TAMER THAN BING
Bard did get a little gooey at one point when asked to write a Shakespearean sonnet and responded seductively in one of the three drafts that it quickly created.
“I love you more than words can ever say, And I will always be there for you,” Bard effused. “You are my everything, And I will never let you go. So please accept this sonnet as a token Of my love for you, And know that I will always be yours.”
But Bard seems to be deliberately tame most of the time, and probably for good reason, given what’s at stake for Google, which has carefully cultivated a reputation for trustworthiness that has established its dominant search engine as the de facto gateway to the internet.
An artificial intelligence tool that behaved as erratically as ChatGPT periodically might trigger a backlash that could damage Google’s image and perhaps undercut its search engine, the hub of a digital advertising empire that generated more than $220 billion in revenue last year. Microsoft, in contrast, can afford to take more risks with the edgier ChatGPT because it makes more of its money from licensing software for personal computers.
BARD ADMITS IT’S NOT PERFECT
Google has programmed Bard to ensure it warns its users that it’s prone to mistakes.
Some inaccuracies are fairly easy to spot. For instance, when asked for some information about the AP reporter questioning it, Bard got most of the basics right, most likely by plucking tidbits from profiles posted on LinkedIn and Twitter.
But Bard mysteriously also spit out inaccuracies about this reporter’s academic background (describing him as a graduate of University of California, Berkeley, instead of San Jose State University) and professional background (incorrectly stating that he began his career at The Wall Street Journal before also working at The New York Times and The Washington Post).
When asked to produce a short story about disgraced Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes, Bard summed up most of the highlights and lowlights of her saga. But one of Bard’s three drafts incorrectly reported that Holmes was convicted of all the felony charges of fraud and conspiracy leveled against her during a four-month trial. Another version accurately reported Holmes was convicted on four counts of fraud and conspiracy without mentioning she was acquitted on four other charges (the jury hung on three other charges that were subsequently dismissed by prosecutors).
“I am still under development, and I am not perfect,” Bard cautioned at one point. “I can sometimes make mistakes, and I can sometimes be misunderstood. I am also aware that my technology can be used for both good and evil.”
WHAT’S NEXT FOR BARD?
Although Bard insisted it doesn’t have a dark side, it acknowledged it can be used to damage reputations, disseminate propaganda that could incite violence and manipulate elections.
“I could be used to create fake news articles or social media posts that could spread misinformation about candidates or their policies,” Bard warned. “I could also be used to suppress voter turnout by spreading discouraging messages or making it difficult for people to find information about how to vote.”
On the lighter side, Bard proved helpful in finding interesting coloring books for adults and hit some notes that resonated during a discussion of rock and roll. When asked who is the greatest guitarist of all time, Bard responded with a broad list of candidates ranging from well-known rock artists such as Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin to jazz virtuosos like Django Reinhardt before making the case for Jimi Hendrix “as a strong contender for the title, his music continues to influence and inspire guitarists around the world.”
Bard also seemed familiar with contemporary artists, such as Wet Leg, which recently won a Grammy award for best alternative music album. “I’ve been listening to their debut album a lot lately and I really enjoy it. I think they have a bright future ahead of them,” Bard said, and cited “Ur Mom” and “Chaise Longue” as its favorite songs by the group so far.
Even with Bard’s occasional miscues, it seemed savvy enough to ask about its potential role in reaching the singularity, a term popularized by computer scientist and author Ray Kurzweil to describe a turning point in the future when computers will be smarter than humans.
“Some people believe that I am a big step toward the singularity,” Bard said. “I believe that I am a valuable tool that can help people to learn and understand the world around them. However, I do not believe that I am the singularity, and I do not believe that I will ever be able to replace human intelligence.”

 The Webb Space Telescope has found no evidence of an atmosphere at one of the seven rocky, Earth-sized planets orbiting another star.
Scientists said Monday that doesn’t bode well for the rest of the planets in this solar system, some of which are in the sweet spot for harboring water and potentially life.
“This is not necessarily a bust” for the other planets, Massachusetts Institute of Technology astrophysicist Sara Seager, who wasn’t part of the study, said in an email. “But we will have to wait and see.”
The Trappist solar system — a rarity with seven planets about the size of our own — has enticed astronomers ever since they spotted it just 40 light-years away. That’s close by cosmic standards; a light-year is about 5.8 trillion miles. Three of the seven planets are in their star’s habitable zone, making this star system even more alluring.
The NASA-led team reported little if any atmosphere exists at the innermost planet. Results were published Monday in the journal Nature.
The lack of an atmosphere would mean no water and no protection from cosmic rays, said lead researcher Thomas Greene of NASA’s Ames Research Center.
As for the other planets orbiting the small, feeble Trappist star, “I would have been more optimistic about the others” having atmospheres if this one had, Greene said in an email.
If rocky planets orbiting ultracool red dwarf stars like this one “do turn out to be a bust, we will have to wait for Earths around sun-like stars, which could be a long wait,” said MIT’s Seager.
Because the Trappist system’s innermost planet is bombarded by solar radiation — four times as much as Earth gets from our sun — it’s possible that extra energy is why there’s no atmosphere, Greene noted. His team found temperatures there hitting 450 degrees Fahrenheit (230 degrees Celsius) on the side of the planet constantly facing its star.
By using Webb — the largest and most powerful telescope ever sent into space — the U.S. and French scientists were able to measure the change in brightness as the innermost planet moved behind its star and estimate how much infrared light was emitted from the planet.
The change in brightness was miniscule since the Trappist star is more than 1,000 times brighter than this planet, and so Webb’s detection of it “is itself a major milestone,” the European Space Agency said.
More observations are planned not only of this planet, but the others in the Trappist system. Looking at this particular planet in another wavelength could uncover an atmosphere much thinner than our own, although it seems unlikely it could survive, said Taylor Bell of the Bay Area Environmental Research Institute, who was part of the study.
Further research could still uncover an atmosphere of sorts, even if it’s not exactly like what’s seen on Earth, said Michael Gillon of the University of Liege in Belgium who was part of the team that discovered the first three Trappist planets in 2016. He did not take part in the latest study.
“With rocky exoplanets, we are in uncharted territory” since scientists’ understanding is based on the four rocky planets of our solar system, Gillon said in an email.
Launched in late 2021 to an observation post 1 million miles (1.6 million kilometers) away, Webb is considered the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, orbiting Earth for more than three decades.
In the past, Hubble and the Spitzer Space Telescope scoured the Trappist system for atmospheres, but without definitive results.
“It is just the beginning, and what we can learn with the inner planets is going to be different from what we can learn from the other ones,” MIT’s Julien de Wit, who was not involved in the study, said in an email.

Tens of thousands of Israelis poured into the streets of cities across the country on Sunday night in a spontaneous outburst of anger after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu abruptly fired his defense minister for challenging the Israeli leader’s judicial overhaul plan.
Protesters in Tel Aviv blocked a main highway and lit large bonfires, while police scuffled with protesters who gathered outside Netanyahu’s private home in Jerusalem.
The unrest deepened a monthslong crisis over Netanyahu’s plan to overhaul the judiciary, which has sparked mass protests, alarmed business leaders and former security chiefs and drawn concern from the United States and other close allies.
Netanyahu’s dismissal of Defense Minister Yoav Gallant signaled that the prime minister and his allies will barrel ahead this week with the overhaul plan. Gallant had been the first senior member of the ruling Likud party to speak out against it, saying the deep divisions were threatening to weaken the military.
But as droves of protesters flooded the streets late into the night, Likud ministers began indicating willingness to hit the brakes. Culture Minister Micky Zohar, a Netanyahu confidant, said the party would support him if he decided to pause the judicial overhaul.
Israeli media said leaders in Netanyahu’s coalition were to meet on Monday morning. Later in the day, the grassroots protest movement said it would hold another mass demonstration outside the Knesset, or parliament, in Jerusalem..
In a brief statement, Netanyahu’s office said late Sunday the prime minister had dismissed Gallant. Netanyahu later tweeted “we must all stand strong against refusal.”
Tens of thousands of Israelis poured into the streets in protest after Netanyahu’s announcement, blocking Tel Aviv’s main artery, transforming the Ayalon highway into a sea of blue-and-white Israeli flags and lighting a large bonfire in the middle of the road.
Demonstrations took place in Beersheba, Haifa and Jerusalem, where thousands of people gathered outside Netanyahu’s private residence. Police scuffled with protesters and sprayed the crowd with a water cannon. Thousands then marched from the residence to the Knesset.
Inon Aizik, 27, said he came to demonstrate outside Netanyahu’s private residence in central Jerusalem because “bad things are happening in this country.” He called the judicial overhaul “a quick legislative blitz.”
Netanyahu’s decision came less than a day after Gallant, a former senior general, called for a pause in the controversial legislation until after next month’s Independence Day holidays, citing the turmoil in the ranks of the military.
Gallant had voiced concerns that the divisions in society were hurting morale in the military and emboldening Israel’s enemies. “I see how the source of our strength is being eroded,” Gallant said.
While several other Likud members had indicated they might follow Gallant, the party quickly closed ranks on Sunday, clearing the way for his dismissal.
Galit Distal Atbaryan, Netanyahu’s public diplomacy minister, said that Netanyahu summoned Gallant to his office and told him “that he doesn’t have any faith in him anymore and therefore he is fired.”
Gallant tweeted shortly after the announcement that “the security of the state of Israel always was and will always remain my life mission.”
Opposition leader Yair Lapid said that Gallant’s dismissal “harms national security and ignores warnings of all defense officials.”
Israel’s consul general in New York City, Assaf Zamir, resigned in protest.
Avi Dichter, a former chief of the Shin Bet security agency, is expected to replace Gallant. Dichter had reportedly flirted with joining Gallant but instead announced Sunday he was backing the prime minister.
Netanyahu’s government is pushing ahead for a parliamentary vote this week on a centerpiece of the overhaul — a law that would give the governing coalition the final say over all judicial appointments. It also seeks to pass laws that would would grant parliament the authority to overturn Supreme Court decisions with and limit judicial review of laws.
Netanyahu and his allies say the plan will restore a balance between the judicial and executive branches and rein in what they see as an interventionist court with liberal sympathies.
But critics say the laws will remove Israel’s system of checks and balances and concentrate power in the hands of the governing coalition. They also say that Netanyahu, who is on trial for corruption charges, has a conflict of interest.
Tens of thousands of people have taken to the streets over the past three months to demonstrate against the plan in the largest demonstrations in the country’s 75-year history. The State Department dismissed as “completely false” claims repeated by Yair Netanyahu, the prime minister’s son, that the U.S. government was financing these protests.
Leaders of Israel’s vibrant high-tech industry have said the changes will scare away investors, former top security officials have spoken out against the plan and key allies, including the United States and Germany, have voiced concerns.
In recent weeks discontent has surged from within Israel’s army – the most popular and respected institution among Israel’s Jewish majority. A growing number of Israeli reservists, including fighter pilots, have threatened to withdraw from voluntary duty if the laws are passed.
Israel’s military is facing an increasein fighting in the occupied West Bank, threats from Lebanon’s Hezbollah militant group and concerns that archenemy Iran is close to developing a nuclear-weapons capability.
Manuel Trajtenberg, head of an influential Israeli think tank, the Institute for National Security Studies, said that “Netanyahu can dismiss his defense minister, he cannot dismiss the warnings he heard from Gallant.”
Meanwhile, an Israeli good governance group on Sunday asked the country’s Supreme Court to punish Netanyahu for allegedly violating a conflict of interest agreement meant to prevent him from dealing with the country’s judiciary while he is on trial for corruption.
The Movement for Quality Government in Israel, a fierce opponent of the overhaul, asked the court to force Netanyahu to obey the law and sanction him either with a fine or prison time for not doing so. It said he was not above the law.
The prime minister said the appeal should be dismissed and said that the Supreme Court didn’t have grounds to intervene.
Netanyahu is barred by the country’s attorney general from directly dealing with his government’s plan to overhaul the judiciary, based on a conflict of interest agreement, and which the Supreme Court acknowledged in a ruling over Netanyahu’s fitness to serve while on trial for corruption. Instead, Justice Minister Yariv Levin, a close confidant of Netanyahu, is spearheading the overhaul.
But on Thursday, after parliament passed a law making it harder to remove a sitting prime minister, Netanyahu said he was unshackled from the attorney general’s decision and vowed to wade into the crisis and “mend the rift” in the nation. That declaration prompted the attorney general, Gali Baharav-Miara, to warn that Netanyahu was breaking his conflict of interest agreement.
The fast-paced legal and political developments have catapulted Israel into uncharted territory, said Guy Lurie, a research fellow at the Israel Democracy Institute, a Jerusalem think tank.
“We are at the start of a constitutional crisis in the sense that there is a disagreement over the source of authority and legitimacy of different governing bodies,” he said.

Russian President Vladimir Putin announced plans on Saturday to station tactical nuclear weapons in neighboring Belarus, a warning to the West as it steps up military support for Ukraine.
Putin said the move was triggered by Britain’s decision this past week to provide Ukraine with armor-piercing rounds containing depleted uranium.
Tactical nuclear weapons are intended for use on the battlefield and have a short range and a low yield compared with much more powerful nuclear warheads fitted to long-range missiles. Russia plans to maintain control over those it sends to Belarus, and construction of storage facilities for them will be completed by July 1, Putin said.
He didn’t say how many nuclear weapons Russia would keep in Belarus. The U.S. government believes Russia has about 2,000 tactical nuclear weapons, which include bombs that can be carried by tactical aircraft, warheads for short-range missiles and artillery rounds.
Putin argued that by deploying its tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, Russia was following the lead of the United States, noting that the U.S. has nuclear weapons based in Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Turkey.
“We are doing what they have been doing for decades, stationing them in certain allied countries, preparing the launch platforms and training their crews,” Putin said, speaking in an interview on state television that aired Saturday night. “We are going to do the same thing.”
Russia has stored its tactical nuclear weapons at dedicated depots on its territory, and moving part of the arsenal to a storage facility in Belarus would up the ante in the Ukrainian conflict by placing them closer to the Russian aircraft and missiles already stationed there.
Some hawkish commentators in Russia long have urged the Kremlin to put the tactical nuclear weapons close to the weapons to send a signal to the West about the readiness to use them.
The U.S. said it would “monitor the implications” of Putin’s announcement.
“We have not seen any reason to adjust our own strategic nuclear posture nor any indications Russia is preparing to use a nuclear weapon,” National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said. “We remain committed to the collective defense of the NATO alliance.”
Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine had Soviet nuclear weapons stationed on their territory but handed them over to Russia after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union.
Putin said Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has long asked to have nuclear weapons in his country again as a counter to NATO. Belarus shares borders with three NATO members — Latvia, Lithuania and Poland — and Russia used its territory as a staging ground to send troops into neighboring Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022.
Putin noted that Russia helped modernize Belarusian military aircraft last year to make them capable of carrying nuclear warheads. He said 10 such planes were ready to go. He said nuclear weapons also could be launched by the Iskander short-range missiles that Russia provided to Belarus last year.
Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who is living in exile, said the agreement to transfer the tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus “underlines the threat to regional security” from Lukashenko’s regime.
“Europe won’t be safe until Belarus dictator is removed & brought before tribunal to face justice for crimes against our country & Ukraine,” Tsikhanouskaya wrote in English on Twitter.
Lukashenko’s support of the war has drawn international criticism and sanctions. But he has publicly stood by Russia, which has pumped billions of dollars into shoring up his Soviet-style, state-controlled economy with cheap energy and loans.
Putin had initially objected to the depleted uranium rounds that Britain promised to ship to Ukraine by making the false claim that they have nuclear components.
He subsequently toned down his language, but insisted Saturday that the ammunition posed an additional danger to both troops and civilians in Ukraine by leaving a radioactive trace and contaminating agricultural land.
“Those weapons are harmful not just for combatants, but also for the people living in those territories and for the environment,” he said.
Putin added that Russia has vast stockpiles of similar ammunition but so far has refrained from using it.
Depleted uranium is a byproduct of the uranium enrichment process needed to create nuclear weapons. The rounds can’t generate a nuclear reaction but they do emit low levels of radiation. The U.N. nuclear watchdog has warned of the possible dangers of exposure.
Such rounds were developed by the U.S. during the Cold War to destroy Soviet tanks, including the same T-72 tanks that Ukraine now faces in its push to break through a stalemate in the east.

 U.S. lawmakers have grilled TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew about data security and harmful content, with some pushing to ban the popular short-video app nationwide.
Chew, a native of Singapore, told the lawmakers that TikTok prioritizes user safety as he sought to avert a U.S. ban on the app by downplaying its ties to China.
Both Republican and Democratic representatives aggressively questioned Chew on topics including TikTok’s content moderation practices, its data security plans, and past spying on journalists.
Here’s a look at some of the concerns about TikTok and its ownership.
WHY DOES WASHINGTON SAY TIKTOK IS A THREAT?
TikTok, which has over 150 million American users, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Chinese technology firm ByteDance Ltd., which appoints its executives.
ByteDance is based in Beijing but registered in the Cayman Islands, as is common for privately owned Chinese companies. Its headquarters is in Beijing’s northwestern Haidian district, home to key universities and a hub for tech startups. TikTok has dual headquarters in Singapore and Los Angeles.
Founded by Chinese entrepreneur Zhang Yiming in 2012, ByteDance is said to be valued at around $220 billion — nearly half of its 2021 valuation of $400 billion. Publicly traded Chinese tech companies and privately held ones like ByteDance have plunged in value since the ruling Communist Party tightened control over the industry with anti-monopoly and data security crackdowns.
Western governments worry Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over TikTok data on American users, exposing sensitive information. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said Friday that China’s government has never and will not ask companies to “collect or provide data, information or intelligence” held in foreign countries, adding the U.S. “has not provided any evidence so far to prove that TikTok threatens U.S. national security.”
ByteDance says 60% of its shares are owned by non-Chinese investors such as U.S investment firms Carlyle Group and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Japan’s SoftBank Group. Employees own 20% and its founders the remaining 20%.
Some details of the relationship between TikTok and ByteDance remain unclear to outsiders.
WHAT CHINESE RULES WORRY WESTERN GOVERNMENTS?
China’s 2017 National Intelligence Law states that “any organization” must assist or cooperate with state intelligence work while a separate 2014 Counter-Espionage Law says “relevant organizations ... may not refuse” to collect evidence for an investigation.
Since ByteDance, which owns TikTok, is a Chinese company, it would likely have to abide by these rules if Chinese authorities asked it to turn over data.
Laws and regulations are only one aspect of the Communist Party’s pervasive control. There are no legal limits on the party’s powers. The authorities also can threaten to cancel licenses, conduct regulatory or tax investigations and use other penalties to compel compliance by Chinese and foreign companies operating in China.
The party sometimes conveys orders using “window guidance,” or informal communication in private. It has used crackdowns to tighten control over technology companies and force them to align with its goals.
The Chinese government has also sought more direct control over companies by getting seats on boards of directors.
MUST TIKTOK TURN OVER DATA IF THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT SAYS SO, EVEN WITH “ PROJECT TEXAS?”
TikTok has promised to protect data on American users by storing it on servers operated by an outside contractor, Oracle Corp., in what’s known as “Project Texas.” Chew, the TikTok CEO, said all new U.S. user data is stored in the United States and the company should finish deleting older U.S. data from non-Oracle servers this year.
The fear is that ByteDance would have to hand over information it obtained from TikTok if ordered to do so by Chinese authorities, but Chew has said Project Texas will put U.S. data out of China’s reach.
ByteDance disclosed in December that four employees gained access to data about reporters and people connected to them while looking for how information about the company was leaked. Chew told the lawmakers China-based ByteDance employees may still have access to some U.S. data but that won’t be the case once Project Texas is complete.
In November, TikTok’s head of privacy for Europe said some employees in China had access to information about users in Britain and the European Union.
DOES THE COMMUNIST PARTY HAVE ANY INFLUENCE ON BYTEDANCE?
In Thursday’s hearing, lawmakers repeatedly tried to pin down Chew on whether ByteDance had links to China’s communist rulers.
He deflected questions about whether staff and top executives are Communist Party members.
“I do know that the founder himself is not a member of the Communist Party, but we don’t know the political affiliation of our employees because that’s not something we ask,” Chew said.
When questioned whether ByteDance was effectively controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, Chew said he disagreed.
After a lawmaker said the Communist Party holds a “golden share” in ByteDance that allows it to control one ByteDance board seat, Chew said, “That’s not correct.”
In China, so-called golden shares held by official investment funds are one way for Beijing to gain more oversight over business by giving them a 1% stake in companies.
Chew pushed back when lawmakers claimed that the Communist Party owns shares in ByteDance that give it a vote in how the company is run. “The Communist Party doesn’t have voting rights in ByteDance,” Chew said.
ByteDance’s main Chinese subsidiary is the license-holder for some of its video and information platforms that only serve the China market.
WHAT IS DOUYIN AND WHAT IS TIKTOK’S RELATIONSHIP WITH IT?
Douyin is ByteDance’s short-video platform for the China market. It’s similar to TikTok, but its content is restricted by Chinese censorship rules that prohibit material deemed subversive or pornographic - a point emphasized by U.S. lawmakers worried about harmful content viewed by young people.
The Communist Party’s extensive internet filters block most users in China from seeing TikTok. ByteDance has said TikTok has “no affiliation” with Beijing ByteDance Technology Co., the subsidiary that operates Douyin; Toutiao, a news and short-video platform, and other services.
HOW DID CHINA REACT TO THE TIKTOK CEO’S WASHINGTON TESTIMONY?
Most of the social media reaction in China was sympathetic to Chew, with praise for how he handled the hostile questions lobbed at him.
Comments on Douyin and microblogging platform Weibo were critical of U.S. lawmakers for asking Chew leading or “trap” questions. Many commenters used a Chinese saying that means “If you want to accuse someone, there’s always a way.”

Key Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi has lost his parliamentary seat after a court found him guilty of defamation over his remarks about Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s surname and he was disqualified from the lawmaking body, a parliamentary statement said on Friday.
Gandhi, who represented a constituency in southern Kerala state as a member of the Congress party, was disqualified from his membership in the lower house of Parliament from March 23, the date of his conviction, the statement said.
Indian parliamentary rules say that a member loses his or her seat if convicted of a crime and sentenced to two or more years in prison.
A court in the western city of Surat sentenced Gandhi to two years in prison on Thursday in the defamation case. But he won’t go to jail immediately because the court granted him bail for 30 days to file an appeal against the verdict. If an appeals court sets aside Gandhi’s conviction, he can get his seat back.
Gandhi briefly visited the Parliament on Friday morning.
Several opposition leaders blocked proceedings in Parliament on Friday and later tried to march to the president’s palace in support of Gandhi, holding a sign that read: “Democracy in danger.”
’“We fought British, we will fight RSS/Modi,” read other placards they carried. The RSS, or Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, is the ideological mentor of Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party.
“The country is witnessing a rule of autocracy,” said A. Raja, an opposition lawmaker.
Police blocked the demonstrators with barricades outside Parliament and whisked them away in buses to a nearby police station. They are expected to be freed later Friday.
The case against Gandhi dates back to an election rally in 2019 when he said: “Why do all thieves have Modi as their surname?” In the speech, he went on to name fugitive Indian diamond tycoon Nirav Modi, banned Indian Premier League boss Lalit Modi and Narendra Modi.
Narendra Modi is not related to either of the other two.
The defamation case was filed by a leader of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party in western Gujarat state. The complainant, Purnesh Modi, said Gandhi’s comments had “defamed the entire Modi community.”
Modi is a common last name in western Gujarat state.
Mallikarjun Kharge, president of the Congress party, said Gandhi would appeal the verdict in a higher court and called Modi’s government “cowardly and dictatorial.”
After the verdict, Gandhi wrote on Twitter: “My religion is based on truth and non-violence. Truth is my God, and non-violence the means to get it.”
Gandhi is one of India’s main opposition leaders and he will most likely go up against Modi when the prime minister seeks a third term in 2024.
Also Friday, 14 political parties filed a petition in India’s top court alleging that Modi’s government was misusing government investigation agencies against opposition leaders for alleged financial crimes.
Abhishek Manu Singhvi claimed that 95% of probes by government agencies are against opposition leaders.
The Supreme Court said it will take up the petition on April 5.

An asteroid big enough to wipe out a city will zip harmlessly between Earth and the moon’s orbit this weekend, missing both celestial bodies.
Saturday’s close encounter will offer astronomers the chance to study a space rock from just over 100,000 miles (168,000 kilometers) away. That’s less than half the distance from here to the moon, making it visible through binoculars and small telescopes.
While asteroid flybys are common, NASA said it’s rare for one so big to come so close — about once a decade. Scientists estimate its size somewhere between 130 feet and 300 feet (40 meters and 90 meters).
Discovered a month ago, the asteroid known as 2023 DZ2 will pass within 320,000 miles (515,000 kilometers) of the moon on Saturday and, several hours later, buzz the Indian Ocean at about 17,500 mph (28,000 kph).
“There is no chance of this ‘city killer’ striking Earth, but its close approach offers a great opportunity for observations,” the European Space Agency’s planetary defense chief Richard Moissl said in a statement.
Astronomers with the International Asteroid Warning Network see it as good practice for planetary defense if and when a dangerous asteroid heads our way, according to NASA.
The Virtual Telescope Project will provide a live webcast of the close approach.
The asteroid won’t be back our way again until 2026. Although there initially seemed to be a slight chance it might strike Earth then, scientists have since ruled that out.

If India stopped burning coal tomorrow, over five million people would lose their jobs. But for a price tag of around $900 billion over the next 30 years, the country can make sure nobody is left behind in the huge move to clean energy to curb human-caused climate change, according to figures released by New Delhi-based think tank Thursday.
The International Forum for Environment, Sustainability and Technology, known by the acronym iFOREST, released two reports detailing how much it will cost for India to move away from coal and other dirty fuels without jeopardizing the livelihoods of millions who still are employed in coal mines and thermal power plants.
Ensuring that everyone can come along in the clean energy shift that’s needed to stop the worst harms of climate change and guaranteeing new work opportunities for those in fossil fuel industries, known as a just transition, has been a major consideration for climate and energy analysts.
“Just transition should be viewed as an opportunity for India to support green growth in the country’s fossil fuel dependent states and districts,” said iFOREST head Chandra Bhushan.
To get the $900 billion figure, the group researched four coal districts in India and identified eight different cost factors, like setting up infrastructure and getting workers ready for the transition.
The biggest single investment to enable a just transition will be the cost of setting up clean energy infrastructure, which the report estimates could be up to $472 billion by 2050. Providing workers with clean energy jobs will cost less than 10% of the total amount required for a just transition, or about $9 billion.
The think tank said $600 billion would come as investments in new industries and infrastructure, with an additional $300 billion as grants and subsidies to support coal industry workers and affected communities.
“The scale of transition is massive. If formal and informal sector workers are included, we are talking about an industry that is the lifeline for 15 to 20 million people,” said Sandeep Pai, a senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington D.C. based think tank. “Reports like this are extremely important since the just transition conversation is beginning only now in India ... we need much more.”
India is one of the largest emitters of planet-warming gases behind only China, the U.S. and the EU. The country depends on coal for 75% of its electricity needs and for 55% of its overall energy needs and is still a far way off quitting.
Earlier this month, the Indian government issued emergency orders stipulating that coal plants are run at full capacity through this summer to avoid any power outages. The country’s coal use is expected to peak between 2035 and 2040, according to government figures.
Prime minister Narendra Modi announced in 2021 that the country will achieve net zero emissions — where it only puts out greenhouse gases that it can somehow offset — by 2070. On Monday, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres urged nations to speed up their net zero goals, calling for developing countries to set a target of 2050. He was met with a muted response.
The reports recommends that the Indian government focuses on retiring old and unprofitable mines and power plants first. Over 200 of India’s more than 459 mines can be retired in this way.
“The energy transition has to start with coal,” said Jayant Sinha, who represents the coal-rich Hazaribagh constituency in the central Indian state of Jharkhand, adding that the switch to clean energy needs both funds and institutions to ramp it up. “Both of this must happen together for a successful transition,” he said.
Partnerships with developed countries to help the coal-reliant nations of South Africa, Indonesia and Vietnam make a just energy transition have been made in recent years. While these deals are steps in the right direction, they’re too small in scale to make a real impact, energy experts say.
It’s still not clear if India will be open to a similar just energy transition deal.
Indian leaders have expressed skepticism over climate funds promised by developed nations, pointing to a promise to give low-income and developing countries $100 billion every year to help with climate challenges back in 2009 that still hasn’t been met.

The Muslim holy month of Ramadan began at sundown on Wednesday, as the faithful prepared for a month of dawn-to-dusk fasting intended to bring them closer to God and to remind them of the suffering of those less fortunate.
For the next 30 days, Muslims will refrain from eating or drinking anything — even the tiniest sip of water — from sunrise to sunset. Many will strictly observe prayers, read the Quran and donate to charity as they seek to draw closer to God. Family and friends will gather for joyful nightly feasts.
This year many will struggle to afford holiday treats amid soaring prices fueled in part by the war in Ukraine. Iran, Egypt and Lebanon are grappling with economic crises that have weakened their local currencies, making things even more expensive.
The holy month will also be shadowed by the suffering in Turkey and Syria, where an earthquake last month killed more than 52,000 people, and in conflict zones across the Muslim world, though there have been some encouraging signs of possible reconciliation.
“We used to look forward to Ramadan as the most beautiful month of every year,” said 19-year-old Rama Jamal, recalling how her family would decorate the house and sit together reading the Quran.
Now she lives alone in the war-ravaged northern Idlib province of Syria. After surviving more than a decade of war, her parents and brother were killed in the earthquake.
“Now I’m by myself, and there’s no mood of Ramadan, there’s no joy,” Jamal said. “I’m missing my family all the time, every hour.”
In the impoverished Gaza Strip, which has been under an Israeli blockade since the militant group Hamas seized power there in 2007, residents struggling to cope with higher prices also fear another war amid months of soaring Israeli-Palestinian violence.
“The prices of many staples have increased crazily,” said Mohammed Forra, a grocery store owner in the Gaza City. He said the price of cooking spices has doubled since last year.
More than 1.8 billion Muslims, who account for around a quarter of the world’s population, are expected to observe Ramadan. Islam follows a lunar calendar, so the month begins a week and a half earlier each year, cycling through the seasons, including the long days of hot summers.
The start of the month depends on the sighting of the crescent moon by local religious authorities and astronomers, and can sometimes vary from country to country. But this year there was broad agreement that it began Wednesday evening, with Thursday declared as the first day of fasting.
In Indonesia, home to the world’s largest Muslim population, worshippers flooded mosques for evening prayers after authorities declared that several Islamic astronomy observer teams had sighted the crescent moon in different regions. Muslim authorities in Saudi Arabia and several other Middle Eastern countries have also announced that Ramadan will begin Wednesday night.
Muslims believe God began revealing the Quran to the Prophet Muhammad during Ramadan more than 1,400 years ago.
The fast is one of the five pillars of Islam and is required for all Muslims, though exceptions are made for young children and the sick, as well as women who are pregnant, breastfeeding or menstruating. Travelers are also exempt, including athletes attending tournaments away from home.
Those observing the fast must refrain from eating, drinking, smoking and sexual intercourse from sunrise to sunset. They are also encouraged to refrain from cursing, fighting, gossip or road rage throughout the holy month.
Many Muslims, particularly those who live in the U.S. and Europe, are accepting and welcoming of others around them who are not observing Ramadan. They also are not expecting shorter work hours, as is the case in the public sector across much of the Arab world during Ramadan.
Eating or drinking in public during the day is generally frowned upon in Muslim-majority countries. In some, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates — home to a large expatriate population in Dubai and Abu Dhabi — it can be punished by fines or imprisonment.
The normal bustle of cities dies down by late afternoon, with streets emptying and shops closing early. Muslims traditionally break the fast at sunset as the Prophet Muhammad was said to have done, with a sip of water and a few dates. Some can be seen happily indulging in a long-awaited cigarette.
After sunset prayers, family and friends gather for “iftars” — feasts with local holiday treats like candies and nuts. Mosques and charities set up outdoor banquets where the poor can eat for free each night of Ramadan. Muslims then wake up early for “suhoor,” a small meal eaten just before dawn.
Five-star hotels, particularly in wealthy Arab Gulf countries, host lavish iftars, and cable networks unveil big-budget soap operas, raking in millions in advertising. Both practices have been criticized by conservatives who fear Ramadan is becoming too commercial.
Ramadan culminates in Laylat al-Qadr, or the Night of Destiny, during the last 10 nights of the month, when Muslims engage in intense late night worship. Muslims believe this was the night God sent the Angel Gabriel to the prophet to reveal the first verses of the Quran.
After the last day of fasting, Muslims celebrate Eid al-Fitr, a festive three-day holiday in which children are often given new clothes and gifts.

 It was a revealing moment during Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s tightly scripted visit to Moscow: Standing in the doorway of the Grand Kremlin Palace, he told Russian President Vladimir Putin that the two of them were “witnessing the changes that haven’t been seen in more than a century, and we are pushing them together.”
“I agree,” Putin responded.
The remarks — caught on a Kremlin camera over a bodyguard’s shoulder — offered a rare glimpse into Xi’s ambitions and his relationship with Russia after more than a year of fighting in Ukraine.
While Moscow increasingly looks like a junior partner to Beijing, Xi is likely to offer a strong lifeline to Putin, his key partner in efforts to reshape the world to try to limit U.S. domination.
Xi’s unusually blunt statement capped more than 10 hours of Kremlin talks, which ended with long declarations filled with florid rhetoric about expanding the “comprehensive partnership and strategic cooperation” between Russia and China, pledges to champion a multilateral approach to global affairs and criticism of Washington.
In his concluding statement, Putin hailed the Chinese proposal for a settlement in Ukraine, which the West had all but rejected as a non-starter. The Russian leader also rolled out a slew of initiatives that cemented his country’s role as a key source of energy and other raw materials for China’s giant economy. He proposed building new energy pipelines, invited the Chinese to fill the niche left after the exodus of Western businesses, and vowed to boost the export of agricultural products to China.
Xi remained tight-lipped, avoiding any firm commitments regarding specific projects and mostly sticking to general and vague rhetoric about expanding ties.
“A lot of things that Vladimir Putin would have liked to happen did not, in fact, happen,” Rana Mitter, professor of Chinese history and politics at Oxford University, told The Associated Press. “There was no point at which Xi explicitly said that he accepted Russia’s position on the Ukraine war over the position of Ukraine.”
In fact, there was “a sense that China was reserving for itself the right to step away from a complete endorsement” of the Russian position, Mitter added.
Moscow and Beijing said they would increase contacts between their militaries and stage more joint sea and air patrols and drills, but there wasn’t even the slightest hint from China about helping Russia with weapons, as the U.S. and other Western allies feared.
Speaking Wednesday before a Senate committee, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said China so far has heeded strong U.S. warnings against providing lethal material support for Russia in Ukraine. “We have not seen them cross that — cross that line,” he said.
A top analyst at the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency said Beijing wants to be seen as a peacemaker and diplomatic heavyweight.
“So I think China would be very reluctant to be seen openly supporting Russia with lethal aid,” said Doug Wade, head of the DIA’s China mission group. “It would undermine their whole narrative about their role in the world that they’re trying so hard to sell.”
U.S. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby described the Putin-Xi relationship as “a marriage of convenience,” in which they pool efforts to challenge U.S. leadership, and the Russians “certainly are the junior partner.” He added at a briefing earlier this week that Putin sees Xi as “a lifeline of sorts” amid the fighting in Ukraine.
Many commentators argued that the summit marked Putin’s failure to win any specific aid from Beijing and cemented Russia’s increasingly subordinate role in the alliance with China.
“China’s domination of Russia is complete,” tweeted Sam Greene, professor in Russian politics at King’s College London. “While there were undoubtedly agreements we are not meant to know about, there is no indication here of a significant increase in military support for Russia — nor even of a willingness on Xi’s part to ramp up diplomatic support. A swing and a miss for Putin.”
After more than a year of fighting in Ukraine and bruising Western sanctions, Russia’s dependence on China has increased significantly. Facing Western restrictions on its oil, gas and other exports, Russia has shifted its energy flows to China and sharply expanded other exports, resulting in a 30% hike in bilateral trade.
Western price caps on Russia’s oil forced Moscow to offer it to China and other customers at a sharp discount, but despite those lower prices, the vast Chinese market ensured a stable flow of oil revenue to the Kremlin’s coffers.
As long as Russia can trade with China and other Asian states, it will face “no danger of running out of money or being forced to concede on the battlefield, said Chris Weafer, CEO of the consulting firm Macro-Advisory.
While profiting handsomely from Moscow’s desperate situation, Beijing would be certain to ramp up its support if it sees Russia dangerously weakened.
“The nightmare scenario for China is that collapse of Russia militarily leads to collapse of the regime and installment of some pro-Western government,” said Alexander Gabuev, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment.
Gabuev argued that Beijing would be unlikely to provide any direct military assistance to Moscow anytime soon simply because it doesn’t feel the pressing need to do so. “Russia is not doing great on the battlefield, but it’s obviously not losing it, so the need to support the Russian military efforts so far is questionable from both sides,” he said.
More than ammunition, tanks and rockets, Russia badly needs China’s help in skirting Western sanctions to maintain the flow of high-tech components for its weapons industries and other economic sectors. Sergei Markov, a pro-Kremlin political analyst, predicted that China could be expected to act more resolutely to help Russia get them.
“Russia doesn’t need weapons from China,” Markov wrote on his messaging app channel. “It needs microchips and components, and they will come.”
Some observers say that while Beijing has been coy about supporting Moscow, it has vital interest in shoring up its ally to avoid being left alone in any potential confrontation with the United States.
Mikhail Korostikov, an expert on Russia-China ties, said in a commentary for the Carnegie Endowment that China has been closely watching Russia’s experience in facing massive Western sanctions. “For Beijing, a close study and partial use of instruments and decisions used by Russia is a reasonable course in a situation when China’s confrontation with the West looks inevitable,” he said.
Korostikov noted that while Moscow’s dependence on Beijing is growing, China’s room for maneuvering is also shrinking.
“There is no alternative to Russia as a partner providing resources that China will critically need in case of an escalation in its confrontation with the West,” he said. “It helps balance the situation and allows Moscow to hope that Beijing will not overuse its newly-acquired economic levers.”

The decision whether to indict former President Donald Trump over hush-money payments made on his behalf during his 2016 presidential campaign lies with a Manhattan grand jury that has been hearing evidence in secret for weeks.
An indictment of Trump, who is seeking the White House again in 2024, would be an unprecedented moment in American history, the first criminal case against a former U.S. president.
Law enforcement officials are bracing for protests and the possibility of violence after Trump called on his supporters to protest ahead of a possible indictment.
An indictment could also test a Republican Party already divided over whether to support Trump next year, in part due to his efforts to undermine his 2020 election loss.
Trump denies any wrongdoing and has slammed the Manhattan district attorney’s office probe as politically motivated.
Here’s a look at the hush-money probe, grand jury process and possible ramifications for his presidential campaign:
WHAT’S THE PROBE ABOUT?
The grand jury has been probing Trump’s involvement in a $130,000 payment made in 2016 to the porn actor Stormy Daniels to keep her from going public about a sexual encounter she said she had with him years earlier. Trump lawyer Michael Cohen paid Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, through a shell company before being reimbursed by Trump, whose company, the Trump Organization, logged the reimbursements as legal expenses.
Earlier in 2016, Cohen also arranged for former Playboy model Karen McDougal to be paid $150,000 by the publisher of the supermarket tabloid The National Enquirer, which then squelched her story in a journalistically dubious practice known as “catch-and-kill.”
Trump denies having sex with either woman.
Trump’s company “grossed up” Cohen’s reimbursement for the Daniels payment to defray tax payments, according to federal prosecutors who filed criminal charges against the lawyer in connection with the payments in 2018. In all, Cohen got $360,000 plus a $60,000 bonus, for a total of $420,000.
Cohen pleaded guilty to violating federal campaign finance law in connection with the payments. Federal prosecutors say the payments amounted to illegal, unreported assistance to Trump’s campaign. But they declined to file charges against Trump himself.
Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s team appears to be looking at whether Trump or anyone committed crimes in New York state in arranging the payments, or in the way they accounted for them internally at the Trump Organization.
BUT CAN A FORMER PRESIDENT BE INDICTED?
In a word, yes. Longstanding Justice Department policy prohibits the federal indictment of a sitting president, but Trump, two years out of office, no longer enjoys that legal shield. And the New York case is not a federal probe anyway.
WHAT IS THIS GRAND JURY?
A grand jury is made up of people drawn from the community, similar to a trial jury. But unlike juries that hear trials, grand juries don’t decide whether someone is guilty or innocent. They only decide whether there is sufficient evidence for someone to be charged. Grand juries exist in the federal court system and in many states.
Proceedings are closed to the public, including the media. There is no judge present nor anyone representing the accused.
Prosecutors call and question witnesses, and grand jurors can also ask questions. In New York, the person who could be indicted may ask for a certain witness, though it’s up to grand jurors.
New York grand juries have 23 people. At least 16 must be present to hear evidence or deliberate. Twelve have to agree there is enough evidence in order to issue an indictment. The grand jury may also find there is not enough evidence of a crime or direct the prosecutor to file lesser charges.
Centuries-old rules have kept grand juries under wraps to protect the reputations of people who end up not being charged, to encourage reluctant witnesses to testify, to prevent those about to be indicted from fleeing and to guard against outside pressure.
Grand juries have long been criticized as little more than rubber stamps for prosecutors. Former New York Judge Sol Wachtler famously said that prosecutors could convince a grand jury to “indict a ham sandwich.” Defenders of the process say it is a crucial safeguard against politically motivated prosecutions.
WHO HAS TESTIFIED IN THIS CASE?
One of the final witnesses being called was Robert Costello, who was once a legal adviser to Cohen, the government’s key witness in the investigation.
The men have since had a falling out, and Costello has indicated that he has information he believes would undercut the credibility of Cohen and contradict his current incriminating statements about Trump.
Costello contacted a lawyer for Trump saying he had information that could be exculpatory for Trump, according to a person familiar with the matter who insisted on anonymity to discuss secret legal proceedings. The lawyer brought it to the attention of the district attorney’s office, which last week subpoenaed Costello’s law firm for records and invited him to testify.
He was at the building where the jurors were meeting on Monday, invited by prosecutors, ensuring the grand jury had an opportunity to consider testimony or evidence that could weaken the case for indicting.
Trump was also been invited to testify, but his lawyer has said the former president has no plans to participate.
WHAT ABOUT THE POLITICAL RAMIFICATIONS?
Trump says charges would actually help him in the 2024 presidential contest. Longtime ally Lindsey Graham, senator from South Carolina, said Saturday that District Attorney Bragg “has done more to help Donald Trump get elected.”
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, considering joining the Republican field, criticizes the Trump investigation as politically motivated, “fundamentally wrong.” But he also threw one of his first jabs at the former president in a quip likely to intensify their rivalry. DeSantis said he personally doesn’t “know what goes into paying hush money to a porn star to secure silence over some kind of alleged affair.”
Comments by other potential rivals, eager to convince voters it is time to move on from the former president but also contending with the fact that he remains the most popular figure in the party:
— During a Saturday visit to Iowa, former Vice President Mike Pence called the idea of indicting a former president “deeply troubling.”
— Asa Hutchinson, the former Arkansas governor mulling his own 2024 bid, said he didn’t expect Trump to withdraw from the race after an indictment, though that would be the “right” thing to do.
— Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, a declared candidate who also served as Trump’s U.N. ambassador, said Monday on Fox News that Bragg’s case was an attempt at scoring “political points,” adding, “You never want to condone any sort of prosecution that’s being politicized.”
“At the end of the day, not one single person’s opinion of him will be any different after indictment than it was before,” veteran GOP operative Terry Sullivan said in an interview. “All of his perceived negatives are already baked into his name ID with voters.”
WHAT ABOUT OTHER TRUMP INVESTIGATIONS?
The New York probe is among many legal woes Trump is facing.
The Justice Department is investigating his retention of top secret government documents at his Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, after leaving the White House, as well as possible efforts to obstruct that probe. Federal investigators are also still probing the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection and efforts to overturn the election Trump falsely claimed was stolen.
Portions of a report from a special grand jury in Georgia that investigated whether Trump and his allies illegally interfered in the 2020 election in Georgia shows jurors believed “one or more witnesses” committed perjury and urged local prosecutors to bring charges. The former president never testified, but the report didn’t foreclose the possibility of other charges.
WHAT’S NEXT IN NEW YORK?
It’s unclear. Trump declared in a social media post over the weekend that he expects to be taken into custody on Tuesday and urged supporters to protest his possible arrest. However, there has been no public announcement of any time frame for the grand jury’s secret work. A Trump spokesperson said there has been no notification from Bragg’s office.
Law enforcement officials have been making security preparations for the possibility of an indictment in coming days or weeks — or a court appearance by the president himself.
WILL TRUMP BE HANDCUFFED?
Anna Cominsky, a New York Law School professor and former criminal defense lawyer, said that her best guess is that Trump’s lawyers will work out a deal with the prosecutor’s office to avoid the spectacle of an indictment with handcuffs and a perp walk.
“There is a great likelihood that he will self-surrender, which means you won’t see a 5 a.m. knock on Mar-a-Lago’s door, officers swarming his house and arresting him and bringing him out in handcuffs,” she said. “He would appear at the prosecutor’s office voluntarily and then be processed, fingerprinted and his picture taken. ”
Cominsky is less sure that Trump would want to avoid a public appearance for his arraignment, which would come within two days of an indictment. At that time a judge lists the charges and asks if the defendant pleads guilty or not guilt.
“He doesn’t shy away from the chaos, so he may want to use this to his advantage,” she said.

Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida made a surprise visit Tuesday to Kyiv, engaging in dueling diplomacy with Asian rival President Xi Jinping of China, who met in Moscow with Russian President Vladimir Putin to promote Beijing’s peace proposal for Ukraine that Western nations have all but dismissed as a non-starter.
The two visits, about 800 kilometers (500 miles) apart, highlighted how countries are lining up behind Moscow or Kyiv during the nearly 13-month-old war. Kishida, who will chair the Group of Seven summit in May, became the group’s last member to visit Ukraine and meet President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, after paying tribute to those killed in Bucha, a town that became a symbol of Russian atrocities against civilians.
Xi and Putin announced no major progress toward implementing the Chinese peace deal, although the Russian leader said it could be a basis for ending the fighting when the West is ready. He added that Kyiv’s Western allies have shown no interest in that.
U.S. officials have said any peace plan coming from the Putin-Xi meeting would be unacceptable because a cease-fire would only ratify Moscow’s territorial conquests and give Russia time to plan for a renewed offensive.
“It looks like the West indeed intends to fight Russia until the last Ukrainian,” Putin said, adding the latest threat is a British plan to give Ukraine tank rounds containing depleted uranium.
“If that happens, Russia will respond accordingly, given that the collective West is starting to use weapons with a nuclear component,” he said, without elaborating. Putin has occasionally warned that Russia would use all available means, including possibly nuclear weapons, to defend itself, but also has sometimes backed off such threats.
Putin’s comment referred to remarks Monday by U.K junior Defense Minister Annabel Goldie, who wrote: “Alongside our granting of a squadron of Challenger 2 main battle tanks to Ukraine, we will be providing ammunition, including armor-piercing rounds which contain depleted uranium. Such rounds are highly effective in defeating modern tanks and armored vehicles.”
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said the plan shows that the British “have lost the bearings,” and Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said “it marked another step, and there aren’t so many of them left.”
But weapons expert Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, former commander of Britain’s Royal Tank Regiment, said it was “reckless” of Putin “to try and suggest Britain is sending nuclear material” to Ukraine. He said depleted uranium is a common component of tank rounds, possibly even used by Russia.
“Putin insinuating that they are some sort of nuclear weapon is bonkers,” he told The Associated Press. “Depleted uranium is completely inert. There is no way that you could create a nuclear reaction or a nuclear explosion with depleted uranium.”
Beijing insists it is a neutral broker in Ukraine, and Xi said after his talks with Putin: “We adhere to a principled and objective position on the Ukrainian crisis based on the goals and principles of the U.N. Charter.” The Chinese plan seeks to “actively encourage peace and the resumption of talks,” he said.
In a joint statement, Russia and China emphasized the need to “respect legitimate security concerns of all countries” to settle the conflict, echoing Moscow’s argument that it sent in troops to prevent the U.S. and its NATO allies from turning the country into an anti-Russian bulwark.
“Russia welcomes China’s readiness to play a positive role in the political and diplomatic settlement of the Ukrainian crisis” and the “constructive ideas” contained in Beijing’s peace plan, the statement said. It added: “The parties underline that a responsible dialogue offers the best path for a lasting settlement ... and the international community should support constructive efforts in this regard.”
After meeting Kishida, Zelenskyy told reporters his team had sent his own peace formula to China but hasn’t heard back, adding that there were “some signals, but nothing concrete about the possibility of a dialogue.”
Kishida called Russia’s invasion a “disgrace that undermines the foundations of the international legal order” and pledged to “continue to support Ukraine until peace is back on the beautiful Ukrainian lands.”
Hours before Xi and Putin dined at a state dinner in glittering Kremlin opulence, Kishida laid flowers at a church in Bucha for the town’s victims.
“Upon this visit to Bucha, I feel a strong resentment against cruelty,” he said. “I would like to represent the people in Japan, and express my deepest condolences to those who lost their loved ones, were injured as a result of this cruel act.”
U.S. Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel noted the “two very different European-Pacific partnerships” that unfolded Tuesday.
“Kishida stands with freedom, and Xi stands with a war criminal,” Emanuel tweeted, referring to Friday’s decision by the International Criminal Court to issue an arrest warrant for Putin, saying it wanted to put him on trial for the abductions of thousands of children from Ukraine.
Kyiv’s allies pledged more support. Washington is accelerating its delivery of Abrams tanks to Ukraine, sending a refurbished older version that can be ready faster, the Pentagon announced. The aim is to get the 70-ton behemoths to the war zone by fall.
The Russia-China front against the West was a prominent theme of Xi’s visit. Russia’s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov accused NATO of seeking to become the world’s dominant military force. “That is why we are expanding our cooperation with China, including in the security sphere,” he said.
Putin is keen to show he has a heavyweight ally and market for Russian energy products under Western sanctions. He and Xi signed agreements on economic cooperation, noting Russian-Chinese trade rose by 30% last year to $185 billion and is expected to top $200 billion this year.
Russia stands “ready to meet the Chinese economy’s growing demand for energy resources” by boosting deliveries of oil and gas, he said, while listing other areas of cooperation, including aircraft and shipbuilding industries and other high-tech sectors.
Whether China will provide military support is a key question. Western officials “have seen some signs” Putin also wants lethal weapons from Beijing, though there is no evidence it has granted his request, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said in Brussels.
Further contacts are planned. Xi said he invited Putin to China this year to discuss a regional initiative that seeks to extend Beijing’s influence through economic cooperation.
Moscow and Beijing have both weathered international condemnation of their human rights records. The Chinese government is accused of atrocities against Uighur Muslims in its far western Xinjiang region. The allegations include genocide, forced sterilization and the mass detention of nearly 1 million Uighurs. Beijing has denied the allegations. Russia has been accused of war crimes in Ukraine, charges it denies.
Kishida rode a train from Poland to Kyiv just hours after he met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi and a week after a breakthrough summit with South Korean President Yoon Suk Yoel.
Both China and Japan have enjoyed recent diplomatic successes that emboldened their foreign policy.
Japan, which has engaged in territorial disputes over islands with both China and Russia, is particularly concerned about the Beijing-Moscow relationship. Both nations have conducted joint military exercises near Japan’s coasts.
Beijing’s diplomatic foray follows its recent success in brokering a deal between Iran and its chief Middle Eastern rival, Saudi Arabia, to restore relations after years of tensions. The move displayed China’s influence in a region where Washington has long been the major foreign player.
Kishida became Japan’s first postwar leader to enter a war zone.
Due to its pacifist principles, Japan’s support for Ukraine has been limited to nonlethal equipment and humanitarian supplies. It has contributed more than $7 billion to Ukraine and accepted more than 2,000 displaced Ukrainians, despite its strict immigration policy.
Tokyo joined the U.S. and European nations in sanctioning Russia over the invasion. By contrast, China has refused to condemn Moscow’s aggression and criticized Western sanctions against Moscow, while accusing NATO and Washington of provoking Putin’s military action.
Japan fears the possible impact of a war in East Asia, where China’s military has grown increasingly assertive and has escalated tensions around self-ruled Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its territory.
In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said of Kishida’s trip: “We hope Japan could do more things to deescalate the situation instead of the opposite.”

When China suddenly scrapped onerous zero-COVID measures in December, the country wasn’t ready for a massive onslaught of cases. Hospitals turned away ambulances, crematoriums burned bodies around the clock, and relatives hauled dead loved ones to warehouses for lack of storage space.
Chinese state media claimed the decision to open up was based on “scientific analysis and shrewd calculation,” and “by no means impulsive.” But in reality, China’s ruling Communist Party ignored repeated efforts by top medical experts to kickstart exit plans until it was too late, The Associated Press found.
Instead, the reopening came suddenly at the onset of winter, when the virus spreads most easily. Many older people weren’t vaccinated, pharmacies lacked antivirals, and hospitals didn’t have adequate supplies or staff — leading to as many as hundreds of thousands of deaths that could have been avoided, according to academic modeling, more than 20 interviews with current and former Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention employees, experts and government advisers, and internal reports and directives obtained by the AP.
“If they had a real plan to exit earlier, so many things could have been avoided,” said Zhang Zuo-Feng, an epidemiologist at the University of California, Los Angeles. “Many deaths could have been prevented.”
For two years, China stood out for its tough but successful controls against the virus, credited with saving millions of lives as other countries struggled with stop-and-start lockdowns. But with the emergence of the highly infectious omicron variant in late 2021, many of China’s top medical experts and officials worried zero-COVID was unsustainable.
In late 2021, China’s leaders began discussing how to lift restrictions. As early as March 2022, top medical experts submitted detailed proposals to prepare for a gradual exit to the State Council, China’s cabinet.
But discussions were silenced after an outbreak the same month in Shanghai, which prompted Chinese leader Xi Jinping to lock the city down. Zero-COVID had become a point of national pride, and Beijing’s crackdown on dissent under Xi had made scientists reluctant to speak out against the party line.
By the time the Shanghai outbreak was under control, China was months away from the 20th Party Congress, the country’s most important political meeting in a decade, making reopening politically difficult. So the country stuck to mass testing and quarantining millions of people, even as omicron evaded increasingly draconian controls.
Unrest began to simmer, with demonstrations, factory riots, and shuttered businesses. The pressure mounted until the authorities suddenly yielded, allowing the virus to sweep the country with no warning — and with deadly consequence.
Experts estimate that many hundreds of thousands of people, perhaps millions, may have died in China’s wave of COVID — far higher than the official toll of under 90,000, but still a much lower death rate than in Western countries. However, 200,000 to 300,000 deaths could have been prevented if the country was better vaccinated and stocked with antivirals, according to modeling by the University of Hong Kong and scientist estimates. Some scientists think even more lives could have been saved.
“It wasn’t a sound public health decision at all,” said a China CDC official, declining to be named to speak candidly on a sensitive matter. “It’s absolutely bad timing … this was not a prepared opening.”
___
PLANS DERAILED
Toward the end of 2021, many public health experts and leaders began thinking about how to exit from the zero-COVID policy. The less lethal but far more infectious omicron made curbing COVID-19 harder and the risks of its spread lower, and nearby Korea, Japan and Singapore were all loosening controls.
That winter, the State Council appointed public health experts to a new committee tasked with reviewing COVID-19 controls, which submitted a report in March 2022, four people with knowledge of it said. The existence of the document is being reported for the first time by the AP.
It concluded it was time for China to begin preparations for a possible reopening. It ran over 100 pages long and included detailed proposals to boost China’s stalling vaccination campaign, increase ICU bed capacity, stock up on antivirals, and order patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms to stay at home, one of the people said. It also included a proposal to designate Hainan, a tropical island in the country’s south, as a pilot zone to experiment with relaxing controls.
But then things began going awry.
A chaotic, deadly outbreak in Hong Kong alarmed Beijing. Then in March, the virus began spreading in Shanghai, China’s cosmopolitan finance hub.
Initially, Shanghai took a light approach with targeted lockdowns sealing individual buildings — a pioneering strategy led by doctor Zhang Wenhong, who had been openly calling on the government to prepare to reopen. But soon, officials in neighboring provinces complained they were seeing cases from Shanghai and asked the central leadership to lock the city down, according to three people familiar with the matter.
China CDC contact tracing reports obtained by the AP show that a nearby province was detecting dozens of COVID-19 cases by early March, all from Shanghai. Provincial officials argued that they lacked Shanghai’s medical resources and capacity to trace the virus, risking its spread to the entire country before China was ready.
At the same time, China’s flagging vaccination rate for older residents and the deaths in Hong Kong spooked authorities, as did reports of long COVID-19 abroad. When Shanghai failed to get control of the virus, the top leadership stepped in. Partial lockdowns in Shanghai were announced in late March. On April 2, then-Vice Premier Sun Chunlan, a top official known widely as the “COVID czar,” traveled there to oversee a total lockdown.
“They lost their nerve,” said an expert in regular contact with Chinese health officials.
Shanghai was ill-prepared. Residents exploded in anger online, complaining of hunger and spotty supplies. But Beijing made it clear that the lockdown would continue.
“Resolutely uphold zero-COVID,” an editorial in the state-run People’s Daily said. “Persistence is victory,” said Xi.
___
KEEPING SILENCE
After Shanghai locked down, Chinese public health experts stopped speaking publicly about preparing for an exit. None dared openly challenge a policy supported by Xi. Some experts were blacklisted from Chinese media, one told the AP.
“Anybody who wanted to say something that is different from the official narrative was basically just silenced,” the blacklisted expert said.
In early April, China’s State Council leaked a letter from the European Chamber of Commerce urging relaxation of zero-COVID controls. Council officials wanted to spark debate but didn’t feel empowered to raise the issue themselves, according to a person directly familiar with the matter.
The State Council’s information office did not respond to a fax requesting comment.
Gao Fu, then head of the China CDC, also hinted at the need to prepare for an exit. At a mid-April internal panel discussion recently made public by the Beijing-based Center for China and Globalization think tank, Gao was quoted as saying “omicron is not that dangerous,” that there were public discussions on whether zero-COVID needed to be adjusted, and that they “hope to reach a consensus as soon as possible.”
Weeks later, at a private event at the German Embassy in Beijing, Gao agreed with foreign experts urging China to plan a reopening and then strode off the stage, according to three attendees who declined to be named because they weren’t authorized to speak to the press. Gao did not respond to an email requesting comment.
There were also hints that opinions differed high in the party.
In private meetings with Western business chambers in May, then-Premier Li Keqiang, who was head of the State Council and the party’s No. 2 official at the time, appeared sympathetic to complaints about how zero-COVID was crushing the economy, according to a participant and another briefed on the meetings. It was a stark contrast with pre-recorded remarks from Xi that listed defeating COVID as the top priority. But under Xi, China’s most authoritarian leader in decades, Li was powerless, analysts say.
Public health experts split into camps. Those who thought zero-COVID unsustainable — like Gao and Zhang, the Shanghai doctor — fell silent. But Liang Wannian, then head of the central government’s expert working group on COVID-19, kept vocally advocating for zero-COVID as a way to defeat the virus. Though Liang has a doctorate in epidemiology, he is sometimes accused of pushing the party line rather than science-driven policies.
“He knows what Xi wants to hear,” said Ray Yip, the founding head of the United States CDC office in China.
Liang shot down suggestions for reopening in internal meetings in January and May of 2022, Yip said, making it difficult for others to suggest preparations for an exit. Liang did not respond to an email requesting comment.
Health authorities also knew that once China reopened, there would be no going back. Some were spooked by unclear data, long COVID and the chance of deadlier strains, leaving them wracked with uncertainty.
“Every day, we were flooded with oceans of unverified data,” said a China CDC official. “Every week we heard about new variants. … Yes, we should find a way out of zero-COVID, but when and how?”
Authorities may also have been waiting for the virus to weaken further or for new, more effective, Chinese-developed mRNA vaccines.
“They didn’t have a sense of urgency,” said Zhu Hongshen, a postdoctoral fellow studying China’s zero-COVID policy at the University of Pennsylvania. “They thought they could optimize the whole process, they thought they had time.”
The Shanghai lockdown stretched from an expected eight days to two months. By the time Shanghai opened back up, it was just months away from China’s pivotal 20th Party Congress, where Xi was expected to be confirmed for a controversial and precedent-breaking third term.
Risking an outbreak was off the table. Though scientists from Beijing, Shanghai and Wuhan wrote internal petitions urging the government to start preparations, they were told to stay silent until the congress was over.
“Everybody waits for the party congress,” said one medical expert, declining to be named to comment on a sensitive topic. “There’s inevitably a degree of everyone being very cautious.”
___
INCREASING PRESSURE
Officials across China took extraordinary measures to stop omicron from spreading.
Tourists were locked into hotels, traders were huddled into indefinite quarantine and many stopped traveling for fear of being stranded far from home. In Inner Mongolia, a state-run ammunition factory forced workers to live in its compound 24 hours a day for weeks on end away from their families, according to Moses Xu, a retired worker.
In brutal lockdowns for over three months in China’s far west, residents in Xinjiang starved, while thousands in Tibet marched on the streets, defying orders in a rare protest. Still, officials stuck to their guns, as the government fired those who didn’t keep COVID under control.
Yet omicron kept spreading. As the congress approached, authorities began hiding cases and resorting to secret lockdowns and quarantines.
Authorities locked down Zhengzhou, a provincial capital home to over 10 million people, with no public announcement, even though they were reporting only a handful of cases. They bused some Beijing residents to distant quarantine centers and asked them not to post online about it, one told the AP. Some village officials deliberately underreported the number of COVID-19 cases to give the sense that the virus was under control.
Local governments poured tens of billions of dollars into mass testing and quarantine facilities. From Wuhan to villages in industrial Hebei province, civil servants were pressed into testing or quarantine duty because local governments ran out of money to hire workers.
At the Congress in mid-October, top officials differing with Xi were sidelined. Instead, six loyalists followed Xi onstage in a new leadership lineup, signaling his total domination of the party.
___
PUSHING FOR CHANGE
With the congress over, some voices in the public health sector finally piped up.
In an internal document published Oct. 28, obtained by The Associated Press and reported here for the first time, Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist at China’s CDC, criticized the Beijing city government for excessive COVID controls, saying it had “no scientific basis.” He called it a “distortion” of the central government’s zero-COVID policy, which risked “intensifying public sentiment and causing social dissatisfaction.”
At the same time, he called the virus policies of the central government “absolutely correct.” One former CDC official said Wu felt helpless because he was ordered to advocate for zero-COVID in public, even as he disagreed at times with its excesses in private.
Wu did not respond to an email requesting comment. A person acquainted with Wu confirmed he wrote the internal report.
Another who spoke up was Zhong Nanshan, a doctor renowned for raising the alarm about the original COVID-19 outbreak Wuhan. He wrote twice to Xi personally, telling him that zero-COVID was not sustainable and urging a gradual reopening, said a person acquainted with Zhong. Business people in finance, trade, and manufacturing concerned about the tanking economy were also lobbying authorities behind the scenes, a government adviser told the AP.
Along with the lobbying, pressure to reopen came from outbreaks flaring up across the country. A Nov. 5 internal notice issued by Beijing health authorities and obtained by the AP called the virus situation “severe.”
In early November, Sun, China’s top “COVID czar,” summoned experts from sectors including health, travel and the economy to discuss adjusting Beijing’s virus policies, according to three people with direct knowledge of the meetings. Zhong, the prominent doctor, presented data from Hong Kong showing omicron’s low fatality rate after the city’s last outbreak, two said.
On Nov. 10, Xi ordered adjustments.
“Adhere to scientific and precise prevention and control,” Xi said, according to a state media account, signaling he wanted officials to cut back on extreme measures.
The next day, Beijing announced 20 new measures tweaking restrictions, such as reclassifying risk zones and reducing quarantine times. But at the same time, Xi made clear, China was sticking to zero-COVID.
“Necessary epidemic prevention measures cannot be relaxed,” Xi said.
___
THE EXIT
The government wanted order. Instead, the measures caused chaos.
With conflicting signals from the top, local governments weren’t sure whether to lock down or open up. Policies changed by the day.
In Shijiazhuang, the capital of Hebei province, officials canceled mass testing and opened the city, only to reinstate harsh measures days later. Xi called city officials, instructing them to have measures that were neither too strict nor too soft, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Individual apartments were put under sudden lockdowns that lasted hours or days. The sheer number of tests and cases overwhelmed medical workers. Travel, shopping, and dining ground to a halt, streets emptied, and the wealthy bought one-way plane tickets out of China.
In late November, public frustration boiled over. A deadly apartment fire in China’s far west Xinjiang region sparked nationwide protests over locked doors and other virus control measures. Some called on Xi to resign, the most direct challenge to the Communist Party’s power since pro-democracy protests in 1989.
Riot police moved in and the protests were swiftly quelled. But behind the scenes, the mood was shifting.
References to “zero-COVID” vanished from government statements. State newswire Xinhua said the pandemic was causing “fatigue, anxiety and tension,” and that the cost of controlling it was increasing day by day.
Days after the protests, Sun, the COVID czar, held meetings where she told medical experts the state planned to “walk briskly” out of zero-COVID. Some were struck by how quickly the tone had shifted, with one saying the leadership had become “even more radical” than the experts, according to a retired official.
On Dec. 1, Xi told visiting European Council President Charles Michel that the protests were driven by youth frustrated with the lockdowns, according to a person briefed on Xi’s remarks.
“We listen to our people,” the person recounted Xi telling Michel.
The final decision was made suddenly, and with little direct input from public health experts, several told the AP.
“None of us expected the 180-degree turn,” a government adviser said.
Many in the Chinese government believe the protests accelerated Xi’s decision to scrap virus controls entirely, according to three current and former state employees.
“It was the trigger,” said one, not identified because they weren’t authorized to speak to the media.
On Dec. 6, Xi instructed officials to change COVID-19 controls, Xinhua reported.
The next day, Chinese health authorities announced 10 sweeping measures that effectively scrapped controls, canceling virus test requirements, mandatory centralized quarantine and location-tracking health QR codes. The decision to reopen so suddenly caught the country by surprise.
“Even three days’ notice would have been good,” said a former China CDC official. “The way this happened was just unbelievable.”
Soon, the sick overran emergency wards and patients sprawled on floors. COVID-19 antivirals sold for thousands of dollars a box on the black market.
In just six weeks, about 80% of the country was infected — more than a billion people, the China CDC later estimated. But even as deaths mounted, authorities ordered state media to deflect criticism over China’s sudden reopening, according to a leaked directive obtained by a former state media journalist and posted online.
“Make a big propaganda push,” it ordered. “Counter the false claims leveled by the United States and the West that we were ‘forced to open’ and ‘hadn’t prepared.’”

Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida began a surprise visit to Ukraine early Tuesday, hours after Chinese President Xi Jinping arrived in neighboring Russia for a three-day visit. The dueling summits come as the longtime rivals are on diplomatic offensives.
Kishida will meet President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Ukrainian capital.
He will “show respect to the courage and patience of the Ukrainian people who are standing up to defend their homeland under President Zelenskyy’s leadership, and show solidarity and unwavering support for Ukraine as head of Japan and chairman of G-7,” during his visit to Ukraine, the Japanese Foreign Ministry said in announcing his trip to Kyiv.
At the talks, Kishida will show his “absolute rejection of Russia’s one-sided change to the status quo by invasion and force, and to affirm his commitment to defend the rules-based international order,” the ministry’s statement said.
Russian President Vladimir Putin warmly welcomed Xi to the Kremlin on a visit both nations describe as an opportunity to deepen their “no-limits friendship.”
Japanese public television channel NTV showed Kishida riding a train from Poland heading to Kyiv. His surprise trip to Ukraine comes just hours after he met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi, and the week after a breakthrough summit with South Korean President Yoon Suk Yoel.
In New Delhi, Kishida called for developing and Global South countries to raise their voices to defend the rules-based international order and help stop Russia’s war.
Japan, which has territorial disputes over islands with both China and Russia, is particularly concerned about the close relationship between Beijing and Moscow, which have conducted joint military exercises near Japan’s coasts.
Kishida, who is to chair the Group of Seven summit in May, is the only G-7 leader who hasn’t visited Ukraine and was under pressure to do so at home. U.S. President Joe Biden took a similar route to visit Kyiv last month, just before the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Due to limitations of Japan’s pacifist constitution, his trip was arranged secretly. Kishida is Japan’s first postwar leader to enter a war zone. Kishida, invited by Zelenskyy in January to visit Kyiv, was also asked before his trip to India about a rumor of his possible trip at the end of March, denied it and said nothing concrete has been decided.
Japan has joined the United States and European nations in sanctioning Russia over its invasion and providing humanitarian and economic support for Ukraine.
Japan was quick to react because it fears the possible impact of a war in East Asia, where China’s military has grown increasingly assertive and has escalated tensions around self-ruled Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its territory.
In Beijing, foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said that Beijing’s contacts with Russia will help to bring about peace. “President Putin said that Russia appreciates China’s consistent position of upholding fairness, objectivity and balance on major international issues,” he said. “Russia has carefully studied China’s position paper on the political settlement of the Ukrainian issue, and is open to peace talks.”
Asked about Kishida’s trip to Kyiv, he added, “We hope Japan could do more things to deescalate the situation instead of the opposite.”
Kishida is expected to offer continuing support for Ukraine when he meets with Zelenskyy.
Television footage on NTV showed Kishida getting on a train from the Polish station of Przemysl near the border with Ukraine, with a number of officials.
Due to its pacifist principles, Japan’s support for Ukraine has also been limited to non-combative military equipment such as helmets, bulletproof vests and drones, and humanitarian supplies including generators.
Japan has contributed more than $7 billion to Ukraine, and accepted more than 2,000 displaced Ukrainians and helped them with housing assistance and support for jobs and education, a rare move in a country that is known for its strict immigration policy.

Chinese leader Xi Jinping arrived in Moscow on Monday on a three-day visit that offers a strong political boost for Russian President Vladimir Putin as fighting in Ukraine grinds on.
China and Russia have described Xi’s trip as part of efforts to further deepen their “no-limits friendship.”
The Kremlin has welcomed China’s peace plan for Ukraine and said it would be discussed talks between Putin and Xi that will begin over dinner on Monday.
Beijing has called for a cease-fire, but Washington strongly rejected the idea as the effective ratification of the Kremlin’s battlefield gains.
Xi’s trip to Russia comes after the International Criminal Court on Friday issued a warrant for Putin’s arrest on war crimes charges. The Kremlin, which doesn’t recognize the authority of the ICC, has rejected its move as “legally null and void.”
China’s foreign ministry on Monday called on the ICC to “respect the jurisdictional immunity” of a head of state and “avoid politicization and double standards.”
China looks to Russia as a source of oil and gas for its energy-hungry economy and as a partner in opposing what both see as American domination of global affairs.
