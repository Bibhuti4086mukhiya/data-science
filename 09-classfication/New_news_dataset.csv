0,political,https://en.setopati.com/political/160818,"Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) has removed Dhaka Kumar Shrestha from lawmaker and party member after the audio recording of a phone conversation alleged to be between him and businessman Durga Prasai.
The party’s central committee meeting held on Wednesday has decided to punish Shrestha after audio recording of him purportedly demanding Rs 20 million from promoter of B&C Medical College Durga Prasai was made public.
Talking to reporters after the meeting RSP President Lamichhane said that Shrestha was removed after finding enough grounds to punish him despite him denying that the voice on the audio was not his.
Kapurbot Media on Sunday had published audio recording of what it claims is the deal between Shrestha and Prasai.
Shrestha, who was elected to the House of Representatives (HoR) through the Proportional Representation electoral system, can be heard telling Prasai that the amount was needed to give to RSP President Rabi Lamichhane’s men for Shrestha to become health minister.
The conversation took place at the start of January, as Prasai informs in the audio, when RSP was negotiating in the then ruling coalition also including CPN-UML to get the Health Ministry. Shrestha can be heard telling Prasai that Lamichhane would make him heath minister only if he hands over Rs 20-25 million to Lamichhane's men.
Lamichhane also revealed that Shrestha threatened the party’s discipline committee to finish RSP if he were punished. “He has been repeatedly changing his version. His guilt was proven also because the audio was recorded in January. He was allowed to present his version (in the party) repeatedly,” Lamichhane stated. “He also wished that he were not removed but also warned that he would show the party if he were punished.”
He claimed that he did not know who Shrestha was referring to as his men in the ‘core team’ in the audio recording. “Why not punish if facts are uncovered about the core team? He has now come to one level of bargaining. What should be known is we will assist the CIAA,” Lamichhane stressed.
Lamichhane added that Shrestha had the option of appealing with the party if he were not satisfied with the decision to punish him.
The party had suspended Shrestha immediately after the audio recording was made public and instructed the central discipline and conduct committee to investigate facts about the telephone conversation and submit the report to the central committee within three days.
RSP has also decided to send acid attack victim Bindabasini Kansakar as HoR member through the PR electoral system to replace Shrestha."

Manager of Paribartan Nepal, that picks garbage from the Singha Durbar, Mitra Ghimire told Setopati that garbage remained unpicked even on Friday due to instruction of Mayor Shah. “We cannot pick garbage until instructed by the KMC to do so,” Ghimire stated.
“Garbage of Singha Durbar will not be picked from today. Leaders there will have to be dumped at Sisdole if the country really has to be cleaned,” Shah had posted on Facebook Saturday to inform about stopping garbage collection.
Taking to Facebook again on Monday Shah blamed the federal government for lack of coordination with the local government despite his continuous efforts for nine months. “The conclusion until now of the disregard, irresponsibility and negligence toward the repeated efforts made is the decision to not collect garbage from the Singha Durbar,” Shah has posted.
KMC Spokesperson Navin Manandhar told Setopati that garbage would not be picked from the Singha Durbar until the federal government summons the KMC for dialogue.
The federal government took exception to Shah’s expression to ‘dump at Sisdole’ and act of stopping garbage collection from the Singha Durbar, and decided to seriously draw his attention to that.
Taking to the social media again on Thursday, Shah stated that Kathmanduites would not have any problem even if the federal capital or the Singha Durbar were shifted from Kathmandu.
“Either you work for the interest of Kathmandu or shift Singha Durbar to another local body. We Kathmanduites don’t have any problem whether you shift Singha Durbar or capital,” Shah posted."
8,political,https://en.setopati.com/political/160824,"Govinda Raj Joshi and his son Deepak Raj have held talks with Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) President Rabi Lamichhane and other leaders.
Joshi’s father-son duo met with Lamichhane and other RSP leaders at Siddhartha Hotel along the Prithvi Highway in Chumlingtar, Chitwan on Thursday morning.
An RSP central member told Setopati that they held talks on the April 23 by-election and other matters with Joshi’s group.
“They have given word for unconditional support to our candidate Swarnim Wagle in Tanahun-1 in the by-election,” the RSP central member said.
Joshi is a former joint general secretary of Nepali Congress (NC). The party had taken disciplinary action against him four years ago after he was accused of playing a role in NC candidate Ram Chandra Paudel’s defeat in Tanahun-1 in the 2017 general election. NC, however, withdrew its disciplinary action against Joshi on April 2.
NC President Sher Bahadur Deuba then held talks with Joshi’s son Deepak Raj at Dhumbarahi and suggested that they should join hands and move ahead together.
But Joshi, issuing a statement on Wednesday, announced that talks with NC have ended for this phase. He accused NC of dillydallying and ambiguous talk.
Joshi’s meeting with RSP leaders comes on the heels of failed talks with NC.
RSP has fielded Wagle as its candidate for the April 23 by-election in Tanahun-1.
Joshi himself had contested the November 20 general election from Tanahun-1. He received 6,878 votes but lost to Ram Chandra Paudel.
Joshi’s group has not fielded any candidate for the by-election. Expelled NC leaders are still active in politics in Tanahun calling themselves NC (Independent Group) and NC (BP Society), and still use the flag of NC.
Deepak Raj had run for mayor of Vyas Municipality in last year’s local election. CPN-UML had also supported him. He received 11,826 votes.
Deepak Raj claimed that they did not talk about the by-election during the meeting with the RSP group led by Lamichhane.
“Swarnim is a friend, we met as friends,” Deepak Raj said. “There wasn’t really much talk about the by-election.”
He said that they have even issued a statement urging Tanahun’s voters to use their discretion when casting their ballots.
“We haven’t fielded our official candidate. We are independent in Tanahun as we are not members of any particular party,” the statement says. “We also urge our well-wishers to vote and elect a candidate who is capable, intellectual and who can uphold Tanahun’s prestige in Nepali politics.”
NC has fielded Govinda Bhattarai in Tanahun-1 while UML has fielded Sarbendra Khanal."

He urged the federal government to untie the knots for resolution of the local problems at the local level.
“How can we say that the government that does not listen to the another government and people’s representatives, and understand and prioritize (their problems) accept the existence of one another? How can we say that the federal government is for strengthening federalism?”
He also listed how the efforts he has made to coordinate with 14 different federal ministries to resolve problems including management of squatters, traffic lights, footpath encroached by diplomatic missions, hospitals, expansion of the Ring Road, street lights and others have failed to yield results due to apathy of the federal government.
Garbage was not collected even from the residence of the president, the prime minister and the federal ministers on Sunday.
Shah did not discuss the issue with other elected representatives or KMC staffers and took the decision unilaterally.
An organization named Paribartan Nepal collects garbage from the Singha Durbar and Manager of the organization Mitra Ghimire told Setopati that Mayor Shah instructed the body to not collect garbage."

Kapurbot Media on Sunday published an audio recording of what it claims is a deal between Shrestha and Prasai. Shrestha can be heard telling Prasai that the amount is needed to be given to RSP President Rabi Lamichhane’s men for Shrestha to become health minister.
The conversation took place at the start of January, as Prasai informs in the audio, when RSP was negotiating in the then ruling coalition also including CPN-UML to get the Health Ministry. Shrestha can be heard telling Prasai that Lamichhane would make him heath minister only if he hands over Rs 20-25 million to Lamichhane's men.

The project caught attention when surrounding houses subsided early Saturday morning due to construction works at the project site.
The project is constructing a 16-story building in the name of The Summit Hotel and Residences that will have a five-star hotel with 130 rooms and 160 units of luxury apartments with investment of over Rs 6 billion, according to the management.
Three business houses jointly own the project with Amrit Raj Shakya, owner of the old Summit Hotel, owning 40 percent stake, Chaudhary Group owned by Nepali Congress (NC) lawmaker Binod Chaudhary 30 percent, and NE Group led by former chairman of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry and former minister Ravi Bhakta Shrestha the remaining 30 percent.
Ravi Bhakta Shrestha is chairman of the project while Sanchit Shrestha is the project director. The Shresthas refused to talk with Setopati despite repeated efforts.
The project issued a statement in the name of project director Shrestha on Monday and promised that ‘further works would be done as per the agreement with the locals in presence of the people’s representatives’ while the Chaudhary Group also issued a separate statement pointing that it only had less than one-third stake in the project and was not involved in project management.
Commissioner for Lalitpur district of the Kathmandu Valley Development Authority (KVDA) Safal Shrestha confirmed with Setopati that the project had started construction without passing the map and completing EIA.
He revealed that the project had applied for passing the map on February 22, 2022 but it was delayed in lack of adequate documents. “They apparently had started construction works without receiving permission.”
He stressed that the KVDA had even written to the project in September 2022 to stop construction after complaints that it started construction. He added that the documents have been provided now by the project but decision to grant permission can be taken only by the board meeting and has yet to be taken.
The Lalitpur Metropolitan City (LMC), meanwhile, has said that Summit Hotel and Apartment will face stringent punishment for violating the laws. Construction at the site has already been stopped. “We will stop construction of the hotel if a hotel cannot be constructed there,” Deputy Mayor Manjali Shakya Bajracharya told Setopati.

According to Lamichhane’s lawyer Murari Sapkota, the court issued the order as the prosecution had applied for an order to produce two witnesses in court stating that their statements had not been recorded.
The case against Lamichhane is set for a final hearing as per the Supreme Court order on February 27 to conclude the case through fast track.
On September 6, 2022, a girl had lodged a rape complaint against Lamichhane with the Gaushal Police Circle.
Lamichhane, then captain of the national cricket team, was in the West Indies to play the Caribbean Premier League when the rape complaint was filed.
Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) had suspended Lamichhane after a case was filed against him.
Nepal Police had issued a diffusion notice through Interpol on September 26 when Lamichhane did not return to Nepal from the West Indies.
Lamichhane eventually returned to Nepal on October 6 and was arrested upon landing at the Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu.
After the preliminary hearing on the case, the Kathmandu District Court on November 4 had issued an order to send Lamichhane to judicial custody.
Lamichhane had appealed against the order at the Patan High Court. On January 12, the Patan High Court had ordered Lamichhane’s release on a bail of Rs 2 million and on certain conditions.
As per the conditions set by the court, Lamichhane could not travel abroad, was required to inform the police if he had to travel outside the Kathmandu Valley, and could not contact the girl directly or indirectly.
Lamichhane and the Office of the Auditor General (OAG) had then moved the Supreme Court against the High Court’s order. Lamichhane had filed a writ petition at the apex court demanding that he be allowed to travel abroad to play cricket, while the OAG had filed a separate petition demanding that Lamichhane be kept in judicial custody during his trial.
Hearing both petitions on February 27, the Supreme Court had upheld the Patan High Court’s order to release Lamichhane on bail and also allowed Lamichhane to travel abroad to play cricket. The court had also ordered that the case be decided through fast track."

Deepak Raj Joshi, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Nepal Tourism Board (NTB) that has been handed responsibility to coordinate the hosting of event, told Setopati that it has decided to immediately stop all preparations.
The International Relations Committee of the parliament has already instructed the government to not host the event. CEO Joshi said preparations will be stopped due to that instruction and in respect of public sentiments. ""We had taken the event as an opportunity for tourism promotion and branding. But we have decided to stop it feeling it is not the appropriate time to host the event due to the instruction of parliamentary committee and other political and social reasons,"" he added.
Minister for Communication and Information Technology Gokul Baskota during the weekly press conference on Thursday had said the event will be hosted in a way that the NTB and the Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) are joint co-organizers. The event was scheduled for the last week of August.
The government had formed a high level committee under Minister of State for Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation Dhan Bahadur Buda.
The event would have cost the government almost Rs 1 billion. The organizers had demanded US$ 4 million from Nepal for getting to organize the event while Nepal would also have to provide air fares, accommodation and local transportation for the guests and participants, the majority of whom demanded business class tickets and five-star accommodation.

The Cabinet has decided to organize the event in Nepal with NTB and Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) the joint co-organizers.
Coordinator of the Visit Nepal Year Suraj Vaidya and Joshi have been handed the responsibility to negotiate with the organizers about the event fee. ""We are in course of discussion. We have only held discussions on the venue and guests but have yet to sign agreement. We have yet to finalize event fee as well,"" Joshi told Setopati.
Joshi revealed that the organizers have demanded the amount for technical preparations including event management to fees for the artistes. But both the NTB and KMC do not have working procedure to pay a foreign company in such manner.
A member of the high-level committee formed by the government to organize the event confided that additional Rs 200 million will be needed for air fares, accommodation and local transportation for the guests and participants. ""The majority of them have demanded business class tickets while they will also want five-star hotels. Another Rs 200 million will have to be spent in that,"" the member told Setopati.
Millions will also have to be spent on security for the guests and awards taking the expenditure to almost Rs 1 billion.
NTB CEO Joshi, however, claimed that the money will be well-spent providing unprecedented promotion for Nepal. ""This is an event with a viewership greater than that of Oscars. This will create a brand for the city. We can also send a message that we are capable and safe to organize such huge events,"" he reasoned. ""They will name the event Nepal IIFA and many television channels will promote the event as Nepal IIFA.""
He said the event will also provide an opportunity to bring multiple stars. ""We have to spend around Rs 50 million to bring one star now. Around 100 stars of that level will arrive for the event.

Video shows the former California governor standing and filming children at a sporting event in Johannesburg when a man makes a flying kick into his back. Schwarzenegger stumbles forward. The man is quickly grabbed by security. Off camera a man shouts several times “Help me!”

The video shortly afterward shows Schwarzenegger smiling and shaking hands with bystanders before walking out ringed by security.

Schwarzenegger later posted on Twitter: “Thanks for your concerns, but there is nothing to worry about. I thought I was just jostled by the crowd, which happens a lot. I only realized I was kicked when I saw the video like all of you. I’m just glad the idiot didn’t interrupt my Snapchat.”

Schwarzenegger also tweeted a second video of the incident “without whatever he was yelling so he doesn’t get the spotlight.”

“By the way...” he joked, “block or charge?”

Schwarzenegger had been attending his Arnold Classic Africa event, which features dozens of sports and fitness activities. In a separate Twitter post, the event blamed a “crazed fan” for the assault.

The statement cited organizer Wayne Price as saying the assailant was “known to the police for orchestrating similar incidents in the past” and that Schwarzenegger was “fine and still in good spirits.”

Drake turned up the love for his mom when he picked up top artist, besting Cardi B, Ariana Grande, Post Malone and Travis Scott. He won 12 awards Wednesday in Las Vegas, making his career total 27 (Swift has 23 wins).

He looked up to the ceiling as he held the trophy, then said: “I just want to thank my mom for her relentless effort in my life.

“I want to thank my mom for all the times you drove me to piano. All the times you drove me to basketball and hockey — that clearly didn’t work out. All the times you drove me to ‘Degrassi.’ No matter how long it took me to figure out what I wanted to do, you were always there to give me a ride, and now we’re on one hell of ride,” Drake said.

Family bonding was a theme at the three-hour show, which aired live on NBC and was hosted by Kelly Clarkson

Ciara’s young son and husband, NFL player Russell Wilson, danced along while she worked the stage, and Nick and Joe Jonas gave kisses to Priyanka Chopra and Sophie Turner of “Game of Thrones” fame when they sang in the audience before hitting the stage. Brendon Urie of Panic! at the Disco looked to his parents as he accepted top rock song, quoting the name of his current hit: “Hey look Ma, I made it!”

Mariah Carey’s twins cheered her on as she sang a medley of her hits and accepted the Icon award. She was in diva form before taking the award from Jennifer Hudson, throwing her napkin on the floor after dabbing her face with it.

“Without getting into all the drama, all the ups and downs of my career ... I guess I always felt like an outsider, someone who doesn’t quite belong anywhere, and I still feel like that lost interracial child who had a lot of nerve to believe I could succeed at anything at all in this world. But, and this is the truth, I did believe because I had to,” she said. “The truth is I dedicated my life to my music — my saving grace — and to my fans.”

Cardi B, the night’s top nominee with 21, locked lips with husband Offset on the red carpet and the couple sat closely inside the venue. She won six awards, including top Hot 100 song for “Girls Like You” with Maroon 5.

“I remember when Maroon 5 hit me up to do this song. I was like, ‘Bro I’m five months pregnant. I can’t even breathe.’ But this record to me was so amazing. I was like, ‘Oh this is going to be a hit.’ And now I sing this song to my daughter because she’s the girl that I need,” she said.

Drake and Cardi B — who both won multiple awards during the live telecast — used their speeches to promote love and appreciation for their peers in the music industry.

Others, too, brought on the positive energy when onstage. Imagine Dragons’ band leader Dan Reynolds used his speech to highlight the dangers of conversion therapy on LGBTQ youth. He earned rousing applause. Florida Georgia Line’s Tyler Hubbard followed suit, telling the audience after winning top country song: “In the spirit of so much truth being spoken tonight by so many talented artists, I think we should speak some truth.”

“As artists we all get to experience so many unbelievable things, but in our opinion, at the end of the day, it’s all for nothing if you’re not using your platform for better ... to spread love, to help those in needs, to be a light to your community,” he said.

Swift kicked off the show when she brought her new music video to life with a colorful, eye-popping performance of her song “ME!” Dancers wearing bright, pastel colors spun in the air holding umbrellas and a marching band kicked off Swift’s performance — like most of the world, maybe she was inspired by Beyonce’s new Coachella film?

Madonna, wearing an eye-patch, teamed up with Colombian singer Maluma for a performance, but it was Grammy-winning Christian artist Lauren Daigle who had the night’s best performance. She sang “You Say,” giving the audience a calm, yet strong and powerful performance. She was backed by three awesome background singers and a pianist.

BTS, who performed alongside Halsey, also had a major night. At the Billboard Awards and American Music Awards, the K-pop band had only previously won “social” awards based off their fanatic fan base, but on Wednesday BTS picked up top duo/group, besting Grammy-winning groups like Maroon 5, Imagine Dragons and Dan + Shay.

“I still can’t believe we’re here on this stage with so many great artists,” RM said as fans screamed loudly. “We’re still the same boys from six years ago, we still have the same dreams ... we still have the same thoughts. Let us keep dreaming.”

An unlikely winner at the Billboard Awards? “Game of Thrones” actress Maisie Williams, whose plays Arya Stark on the HBO series and shined brightly on last week’s episode.

“Shout-out to Arya Stark for putting in that work last week,” Drake said onstage after winning his first award of the evening."

52,entertainment,https://en.setopati.com/entertainment/143896,"Actress Amber Heard asked a judge Thursday to dismiss a $50 million defamation lawsuit her ex-husband Johnny Depp filed over an op-ed about domestic violence she wrote in The Washington Post, and provided new evidence toward her allegations of abuse.

In the motion filed in the Circuit Court of Fairfax, Virginia, Heard describes in new detail more than a dozen instances before and during their marriage when she says Depp slapped her, shoved her, pulled her hair or choked her. Depp has denied any such abuse. The allegations have appeared in the couple’s divorce and other legal fights.

Heard includes exhibits such as photos of her with bruises on her face and scars on her arms, images of damage she says Depp did to their home, and newly revealed screenshots of text messages describing the incidents at the time, and excerpts of her divorce deposition describing domestic abuse.

“Johnny Depp physically and verbally abused Amber Heard,” her attorney Eric George said in a statement. “Since their divorce, Mr. Depp has continued to publically harass Ms. Heard, and attempted to gaslight the world by denying his abuse. It is long past time for Mr. Depp’s despicable conduct to end.”

Depp’s lawsuit, filed last month, called the ongoing allegations of domestic abuse “categorically and demonstrably false.”

“They were part of an elaborate hoax to generate positive publicity for Ms. Heard and advance her career,” the lawsuit states, claiming that “she is the perpetrator.”

Depp’s attorney, Adam Waldman, said he was reviewing the new filing. He said previously that he and Depp looked forward to providing evidence that would clear Depp’s name.

The Post piece by Heard, published in December, does not mention Depp by name or describe any incidents, but it discusses the societal plight of those who speak up about domestic abuse.

“I spoke up against sexual violence — and faced our culture’s wrath,” the 32-year-old actress wrote, adding that she felt as though she was “on trial in the court of public opinion.”

But Depp’s lawsuit says it was clear Heard was talking about him, and that it worsened the damage the allegations had already done to his career.

The lawsuit states Depp, 55, has suffered financial losses because of the accusations, including being dropped from his role as Capt. Jack Sparrow in the “Pirates of the Caribbean” films.

Heard’s lawyers also argued that the lawsuit should be moved to Los Angeles because that’s where the relevant events took place and the court would be in a position to subpoena witnesses and find facts.

Heard first accused Depp of domestic violence in May 2016, the year after they were married. They were divorced in 2017.

60,entertainment,https://en.setopati.com/entertainment/140685,"Billy Porter, speaking to Vogue before he walked the Oscars red carpet, knew what he was in for among some social media users:

“People are going to be really uncomfortable with my black ass in a ball gown, but it’s not anybody’s business but mine.”

The remark from the Tony-winning stage performer, actor and singer was both prescient and disproven. There was mega-praise for his velvet custom tuxedo look by Christian Siriano and outrage over the notion that an African American man in a dress was a threat to black masculinity.

It was just the conversation Porter had hoped to provoke, not to collect virulent hate but to help move along the idea that we all deserve respect, across racial lines and the gender divide.

“I was ready to create the conversation,” Porter told The Associated Press in a phone interview Monday the day after the Oscars. “We have to teach people how to treat us, we have to teach people how to love us, we have to teach people how to respect us, and the only way we do that is to respect ourselves.”

Porter, the black and gay breakout star of the boundary-expanding FX series “Pose,” spent awards season using fashion as political art, as he describes it. There were previous dresses, and there was help from powerhouses Tom Ford and Michael Kors in the later weeks, along with smaller designers who embrace a greater gender fluidity in their collections and were thrilled early on to dress him.

As a nominee at the Golden Globes, Porter’s custom trouser look by Randi Rahm, including a huge, hot pink-lined cape and floral embellishments, grabbed attention, but social media support and disdain after the 49-year-old took to the Oscars carpet took the debate into the stratosphere.

Porter understands where established notions of black masculinity originated, and he understands how toxic they can be. He and his stylist, Sam Ratelle, also realize how rigid gender-driven taboos can be and want to help the walls come down.

“It goes all the way back to the earliest of emasculations, which is slavery, so the only way to sort of overcome that is to be the strongest and the most masculine and the most powerful and now, what has become toxic,” Porter said. “And I don’t think it’s just black people. I think it’s men in general. Every ethnicity has their version of it.”

Porter couldn’t care less about negative comments.

“The comments are not my business. What people think about what I’m doing is not my business. I lived that already,” he said. “I’m inside of my authenticity and the whole point is that you have to respect me as much as I respect you. If you don’t like it, go somewhere else. You don’t have to look. It’s not about you. I don’t understand why my putting on a dress causes this much strife in your life.”

Ratelle said he began working with Porter about a year ago.

“He said, ‘I want to be a piece of walking art,’ and we just went from there,” Ratelle said. “It’s been really awesome to work with a bunch of great designers. Randi Rahm was certainly completely open. Issey Miyake was fantastic for the Radio City show (Porter was a study in white). Christian Siriano, the fact that he did this custom gown in one week, was incredible after saying, ‘Absolutely. There’s no question we’ll do this.’ Michael Kors has been the most gracious human. So has Tom Ford.”

Porter said he’s just getting started in terms of pushing along the conversation.

“People are actually listening,” he said. “I hope it opens up a dialogue of healing. I will always continue to do me. If there’s anything I’ve learned in the 49 years that I’ve lived on this planet, is that being authentic is the only version of the story that anybody should be.”

Porter has always been a fashion lover. This year, he was an ambassador for the Council of Fashion Designers of America for men’s fashion week in New York and attended a variety of shows featuring a variety of looks, from traditional to gender fluid.

Now that awards season is over, and the fashion week cycle is finishing up in Paris, Porter said he’ll continue to wear whatever he likes, with a great number of designers on board to help with pulls from their lines and custom outfits.

“Pre-Golden Globes it was difficult,” he said of options available to him, considering that he’s not sample size. “After the Golden Globes it has not been difficult. You work with the people who work with you. You walk through the doors that are open. I’m never a beggar.”

In real life, or at least on live TV during the Oscars, Helen Mirren appeared ready for change, noting that both she and her co-presenter, Jason Momoa, were dressed in pink.

“It just goes to show, doesn’t it, that these days a Hawaiian god and a very mature Englishwoman can actually wear the same color. We can both wear pink,” she said to claps.

Momoa agreed: “Finally. The times are changin’.”"

Makeup and hairstyling: “Vice”"
62,sports,https://en.setopati.com/sports/160161,"Pelé was simply “The King.” He embraced “the beautiful game” of soccer in his 1958 World Cup debut for Brazil and never really let go.
He won a record three World Cups and was widely regarded as one of his sport’s greatest players. His majestic and galvanizing presence set him among the most recognizable figures in the world.
Pelé died Thursday at 82. He had undergone treatment for colon cancer since 2021.
Pelé was among the game’s most prolific scorers and spent nearly two decades enchanting fans and dazzling opponents. His grace, athleticism and moves on soccer’s highest stage transfixed all. He orchestrated a fast, fluid style of play that revolutionized the sport — a flair that personified Brazilian elegance on the field.
He carried his country to soccer’s heights and became a global ambassador for his sport in a journey that began on the streets of Sao Paulo state, where he would kick a sock stuffed with newspapers or rags.
“Pelé changed everything. He transformed football into art, entertainment,” Neymar, a fellow Brazilian soccer player, said on Instagram. “Football and Brazil elevated their standing thanks to the King! He is gone, but his magic will endure. Pelé is eternal!”
In the conversation about soccer’s greatest player, only the late Diego Maradona, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are mentioned alongside him.
Different sources, counting different sets of games, list Pelé’s goal totals anywhere between 650 (league matches) to 1,281 (all senior matches, some against low-level competition). When Maradona once interviewed Pelé, he playfully asked the Brazilian how he accumulated so many goals.
The player who would be dubbed “The King” was introduced to the world at 17 at the 1958 World Cup in Sweden, the youngest player ever at the tournament.
Pelé was the emblem of his country’s World Cup triumph of 1970 in Mexico. He scored in the final and set up Carlos Alberto with a nonchalant pass for the last goal in a 4-1 victory over Italy.
The image of Pelé in a bright-yellow Brazil jersey, with the No. 10 stamped on the back, remains alive with soccer fans everywhere. As does his trademark goal celebration — a leap with a right fist thrust high above his head.
Pelé’s fame was such that in 1967 factions of a civil war in Nigeria agreed to a brief cease-fire so he could play an exhibition match in the country. He was knighted by Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II in 1997. When Pelé visited Washington to help popularize the game in North America, it was the U.S. president who stuck out his hand first.
“You don’t need to introduce yourself because everyone knows who Pelé is,” Ronald Reagan said.
Pelé was Brazil’s first modern Black national hero but rarely spoke about racism in a country where the rich and powerful tend to hail from the white minority.
Opposing fans taunted Pelé with monkey chants at home and all over the world.
“He said that he would never play if he had to stop every time he heard those chants,” said Angelica Basthi, one of Pelé’s biographers. “He is key for Black people’s pride in Brazil, but never wanted to be a flagbearer.”
Pelé’s life after soccer took many forms. He was a politician — Brazil’s Extraordinary Minister for Sport — a wealthy businessman, and an ambassador for UNESCO and the United Nations.
He had roles in movies, soap operas and even composed songs and recorded CDs of popular Brazilian music.
Pelé was an ambassador for his sport until his final years but as his health deteriorated his travels and appearances became less frequent. After needing a hip replacement, he started using a cane.
He was often seen in a wheelchair during his final years and did not attend a ceremony to unveil a statue of him representing Brazil’s 1970 World Cup team.
“He gets very shy, he gets very embarrassed,” his son Edinho told Globoesporte.com. “He doesn’t want to go out.”
Pelé spent his 80th birthday with a few relatives.
Pelé spent a month hospitalized in 2021 after surgery to remove a tumor from his colon. Pelé said he was ready “to play 90 minutes, plus extra time,” but soon started chemotherapy.
Born Edson Arantes do Nascimento, in the small city of Tres Coracoes in the interior of Minas Gerais state on Oct. 23, 1940, Pelé grew up shining shoes to buy his modest soccer gear. His father was also a player.
Pelé’s talent drew notice when he was 11, and a local professional player brought him to Santos’ youth squads. Despite his youth and 5-foot-8 frame Pelé’ scored against grown men with the same ease he displayed against friends back home. He debuted with the Brazilian club at 15 in 1956, and the club quickly gained worldwide recognition.
The name Pelé came from him mispronouncing the name of a player called Bilé. He later became known simply as ‘O Rei’ – The King.
Pelé went to the 1958 World Cup as a reserve but became a key part for his country’s championship team. His first goal, in which he flicked the ball over the head of a defender and raced around him to volley it home, was voted as one of the best in World Cup history.
“When Pelé scored,” veteran Swedish midfielder Sigge Parling said, “I have to be honest and say I felt like applauding.”
The 1966 World Cup in England — won by the hosts — was a bitter one for Pelé, by then already considered the world’s top player. Brazil was knocked out at the group stage and Pelé, angry at fouls and hard tackles by Portugal, swore it was his last World Cup.
He changed his mind and was rejuvenated in the 1970 World Cup. In a game against England, he struck a header for a certain score, but the great goalkeeper Gordon Banks flipped the ball over the bar in an astonishing move. Pelé likened the save — one of the best in World Cup history — to a “salmon climbing up a waterfall.” Later, he scored the opening goal in the final against Italy, his last World Cup match.
In all, Pelé played 114 matches with Brazil, scoring a record 95 goals — including 77 in official matches. Most of his goals came with Santos, which he led to five national titles, two Copa Libertadores trophies and two club world championships — all in the 1960s.
His run with Santos stretched over three decades until he went into semi-retirement after the 1972 season. Wealthy European clubs tried to sign him, but the Brazilian government intervened to keep him from being sold, declaring him a national treasure.
On the field, Pelé’s energy, vision and imagination drove a gifted Brazilian national team, with intricate passing combinations slicing defenses while leaving room for players to showcase flashy skills.
The fast, fluid style of play exemplified “O Jogo Bonito” — Portuguese for “The Beautiful Game.” And at the center of it all, like a maestro in command of his orchestra, was Pelé. It was his 1977 autobiography, “My Life and the Beautiful Game,” that made the phrase part of soccer’s lexicon.
In 1975, he joined the New York Cosmos of the North American Soccer League. Although he was past his prime at 34 years old, Pelé briefly gave soccer a higher profile in North America before ending his career on Oct. 1, 1977, in an exhibition between the Cosmos and Santos. Among the dignitaries on hand was perhaps the only other athlete whose renown spanned the globe — Muhammad Ali.
Pelé had two daughters out of wedlock and five children from his first two marriages, to Rosemeri dos Reis Cholbi and Assiria Seixas Lemos. He later married businesswoman Marcia Cibele Aoki."

66,sports,https://en.setopati.com/sports/159578,"Sri Lanka’s inexperienced cricket team overcame a poor start with bat and ball to put on an impressive all-round show Sunday and win the Asia Cup for the sixth time with a 23-run victory over Pakistan.
Bhanuka Rajapaksa hit an unbeaten 71 off 45 balls in Dubai and led Sri Lanka as it recovered from 58-5 to reach 170-6 in the final after Pakistan won the toss and elected to field.
Pakistan crashed to 147 all out off the last balls as its top order continued to struggle against the pace with fast bowler Pramod Madushan claiming 4-34 in only his second T20 international.
Leg-spinner Wanindu Hasaranga then baffled the lower order with his sharp googlies to accelerate Pakistan’s collapse.
Hasaranga, who earlier scored 36 off 21 balls, had Pakistan’s top-scorer Mohammad Rizwan (55) caught in the deep in his last over before claiming the wickets of Asif Ali and Khushdil Shah in the same over to finish with 3-27.
“It was all about nerves, I knew the youngsters can always deliver,” Sri Lanka skipper Dasun Shanaka said. “We have players with good caliber, and they stood up well.”
Sri Lanka had an awful bowling start when left-arm fast bowler Dilshan Madushanka conceded nine runs through a no ball and several wides before the 21-year-old’s first legitimate delivery at the sixth attempt.
Madushan, who made his T20 debut in the last Super 4 match against Pakistan on Friday, settled his team’s nerves quickly by claiming the wickets of Babar Azam (5) and Fakhar Azam (0) off successive deliveries inside the powerplay.
Babar was brilliantly snapped up by Madushanka over his head at short fine leg off a hard flick and Fakhar went for a golden duck by dragging the first ball onto his stumps.
Babar, the second-ranked T20 batter, ended the tournament with only 68 runs in six games.
“As a batting unit we didn’t perform according to our potential,” Babar said. “We didn’t finish the way we would have wanted to and gave away 15-20 extra runs … the more you learn from these ups-and-downs is good, but you need to reduce your mistakes.”
Rizwan and Iftikhar Ahmed (32) added 71 runs for the third wicket in almost 10 overs as Sri Lanka kept mounting the pressure by bowling tidily in the middle overs.
Madushan broke the stand in his return spell as Pakistan collapsed from 102-3 to lose its last seven wickets for 45 runs with Sri Lanka fielders holding onto all their catches.
Earlier, Pakistan’s fearsome pace attack, led by Haris Rauf (3-29), had Sri Lanka in trouble inside the first nine overs before Rajapaksa and Hasaranga led the recovery.
Rajapaksa hit six fours and three sixes in his innings.
Fast bowler Naseem Shah (1-40) had Kusal Mendis clean bowled off the first ball with a stunning inswinging delivery while Rauf dismissed Pathum Nissanka and Danushka Gunathilaka.
But Rajapaksa and Hasaranga counterattacked after having negotiated the spin threat of Shadab Khan (1-28). Surprisingly Babar used his premium left-arm spinner Mohammad Nawaz for only one over which went for three runs as both Sri Lanka batters cut loose against the pace of Shah and Mohammad Hasnain (0-41).
Pakistan was scrappy in the field as Rajapaksa was dropped either side of his half century by Shadab in the deep. Rauf had Hasaranga caught behind in the 15th over, but Rajapaksa added a further 54 runs in the last five overs with Chamika Karunaratne, who made 14 not out.
Rajapaksa provided Sri Lanka with a late flourish when he smashed Shah for a boundary off the penultimate ball and then smashed a six over extra cover to give Sri Lanka a strong total to defend.
Sri Lanka made a stunning comeback with five successive wins in the tournament after getting beaten by Afghanistan in its opening game. Sri Lanka also beat Pakistan in the last Super 4 game."
67,sports,https://en.setopati.com/sports/159537,"Mislav Oršić must wish he could play English teams every week.
The Croatia forward ran from the halfway line and produced a deft finish in the 13th minute to lead Dinamo Zagreb to a surprising 1-0 win over Chelsea in their opening Group E match in the Champions League on Tuesday.
Add that goal to Oršić’s feats against English clubs in the Europa League: a winner against West Ham last season and a hat trick to eliminate Jose Mourinho’s Tottenham in 2020-21.
It marked a memorable start by Dinamo to its first group-stage campaign in Europe’s top competition since 2019-20, having reached this point by coming through three qualifying rounds.
As for Chelsea, it was the latest disappointing result in an unconvincing start to the season for a club that spent nearly $300 million on refreshing its squad in the summer transfer window.
The two-time European champions dominated the match in the Croatian capital but were let down by poor finishing, which dovetailed with scrambling defense and some great saves by Dominik Livaković for the hosts.
“We are clearly not where we need to be, or where we can be,” said Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel, whose team has already lost to Leeds and Southampton in the Premier League.
Asked specifically what he didn’t like about Chelsea’s performance, Tuchel said: “At the moment, everything is missing.”
In the second half, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang — making his debut for Chelsea after a deadline-day move from Barcelona and wearing a mask to protect his injured cheek — had a goal disallowed for a narrow offside against Ben Chilwell in the build-up. Then, in a frantic finish, Reece James smashed a shot against the post before Livaković made a stunning double stop to deny Mason Mount then Hakim Ziyech.
Ultimately, the smash-and-grab win was earned thanks to the early goal by Oršić, who met a headed flick-on by Bruno Petković in midfield by chesting the ball forward inside his own half past Chelsea defender Wesley Fofana and racing clear of the newly signed French defender toward goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga.
As he approached Kepa, Oršić lifted the ball over the keeper and it bobbled into the net.
Dinamo looked dangerous in the rare attacks it had in a performance underpinned by defensive discipline and, from one counterattack, Stefan Ristovski powered in a rising shot that was tipped onto the crossbar by Kepa, who was selected ahead of Edouard Mendy.
“It’s an underperformance from us,” Tuchel said. “We have the same story as always — we have an OK start, we don’t finish our half-chances, we don’t feel it when the game is already there to put to bed in the first 15-20 minutes, then we concede one counter-attack which is far too easy.
“And from there, we struggled.”"
68,sports,https://en.setopati.com/sports/159515,"Remember that time, not so long ago, when there was a crisis at Manchester United?
After four straight wins, it seems like a dim and distant memory.
The latest sign that United is well on the road to recovery came on Sunday with a 3-1 win over Arsenal, whose 100% start to the season came crashing to an end.
There were still anti-Glazer chants inside and outside Old Trafford — it feels like they are here to stay, whether the team wins or loses — but they are now accompanied by frequent and jubilant roars for goals.
Two of them were scored in the second half by Marcus Rashford to sweep United to victory after Arsenal pulled it back to 1-1 through Bukayo Saka, but the opening goal felt the most significant.
Antony, United’s latest big signing from Ajax for $95 million, marked his first match in English soccer with a goal from a curling, first-time finish in the 35th minute, crowning a performance that featured a slew of jinks, feints and exaggerated stepovers that thrilled home fans. He came off in the 58th to a standing ovation to be replaced by Cristiano Ronaldo, who again had to settle for a starting spot on the bench.
Since that humiliating 4-0 loss at Brentford that sparked a crisis and some doubts around the wisdom of hiring Erik ten Hag as manager, United has beaten Liverpool, Southampton, Leicester and now Arsenal, the league leader.
After six games, United is only three points behind Arsenal and two behind Manchester City, the title favorite.
How quickly things have turned around."
69,sports,https://en.setopati.com/sports/159497,"Manchester United secured its third straight win in the Premier League by beating Leicester 1-0 on Thursday, with Cristiano Ronaldo again only making a late appearance off the bench.
Jadon Sancho finished off a flowing move on the break for the only goal of the game in the 23rd minute as United’s players backed up victories over Liverpool and Southampton to put their early-season crisis behind them.
“It is another step forward,” United manager Erik ten Hag said.
It was only 10 days ago that United went into its home game against Liverpool on the back of back-to-back defeats to open the season with doubts swirling around the suitability of Ten Hag — its recently hired coach from Ajax — and his new signings.
Those doubts have pretty much disappeared, with United playing with more confidence and the additions of Casemiro — a second-half substitute like Ronaldo — and Antony — who wasn’t available after completing his move from Ajax on Thursday — strengthening the team. Back-to-back clean sheets is a big positive, too.
Ronaldo might yet play a significant part this season after failing to secure a move away in the transfer market that shut soon after the full-time whistle. He came on in the 68th minute and looked lively, an acrobatic bicycle kick flying just wide.
“Once we have Cristiano Ronaldo and Casemiro getting fitter, it will get better still,” Ten Hag said. “We need not only a team, we need a squad.”
In the end, Sancho’s goal separated the teams and it came after United claimed possession following a Leicester goal kick. Bruno Fernandes found Marcus Rashford in a central position and he slipped in Sancho, who rounded goalkeeper Danny Ward and slotted the ball into an empty net.
Leicester is now the Premier League’s crisis club, with just one point from its first five games and two points adrift in last place. The pressure is rising on its manager, Brendan Rodgers, who grumbled after the match about the club’s failure to strengthen the squad in the summer transfer.
Leicester only signed one outfield player, unheralded defender Wout Faes from French club Reims, and he only arrived on deadline day to fill the gap left by the departure of Wesley Fofana to Chelsea.
“With the greatest respect,” Rodgers said, “we have not had the help in the market this team needed.”
The hosts only seriously threatened United goalkeeper David De Gea once and that was from a free kick, which James Maddison whipped over the defensive wall and brought out a fine one-handed save. James Justin blazed over in stoppage time with Leicester’s other good chance.
United will face a bigger challenge on Sunday, when Arsenal — with its 100% record — visits Old Trafford.
“It is a good test to see where we are,” Ten Hag said."
70,sports,https://en.setopati.com/sports/159489,"Erling Haaland is taking English soccer by storm.
Back-to-back hat tricks. Nine goals in five games. No player has ever made as good a start to the Premier League as the towering Norway striker.
Haaland’s latest three-goal haul came in the first half of City’s 6-0 thrashing of Nottingham Forest on Tuesday, three days after achieving the same feat in the second half against Crystal Palace.
City was banking on Haaland being the heir to long-time striker Sergio Aguero and it’s already looking as if that is the case.
Aguero previously held the record for most goals in a player’s first five Premier League appearances, with eight along with former Coventry striker Mick Quinn (from the early 1990s). Haaland has bettered that, and surely more scoring records will fall if he continues like this.
For example, can he become the first player to score 40 goals in a single top-flight campaign in England since Tottenham’s Jimmy Greaves in 1960-61?
“What Haaland wants is to win titles,” Guardiola said of the striker who scored with his left foot, right foot and head against Forest. “Knowing him, he would not be happy to break records if we don’t win titles.
“Sergio is a legend — no one can break his position in the hearts of Man City fans. But Erling has the quality to be there.”
City is the red-hot favorite to win the Premier League again with Haaland leading the line and is unbeaten with four wins from five games.
Even its back-up striker is scoring, with Julian Alvarez — an offseason arrival from River Plate — marking his first start with two goals in the second half. Joao Cancelo also scored with a blast from outside the box.
Still, the champions aren’t top. That honor remains with Arsenal.
PERFECT START
Arsenal has matched its best ever start to a Premier League season after securing a fifth straight win to open the season by beating Aston Villa 2-1.
Gabriel Martinelli’s 77th-minute goal clinched victory at Emirates Stadium after Arsenal was pegged back by conceding a goal straight from a corner by Douglas Luiz, who did the same in an English League Cup match last week, too.
That came against the run of play, with Arsenal dominating the game but only having Gabriel Jesus’ 30th-minute goal — his third of the season — to show for it.
“That is the spirit we need to keep for the whole season,” Martinelli said.
Villa has lost four of its five games, leaving manager Steven Gerrard under pressure.
LATE, LATE GOAL
Liverpool is battling hard to keep up with the fierce pace set by Arsenal and City, needing a goal in the eighth minute of stoppage time by Fábio Carvalho to claim a dramatic 2-1 win over Newcastle.
Alexander Isak gave Newcastle the lead in the 38th on his debut following a move from Real Sociedad on Friday for a club-record fee and was denied a second goal by narrow offside call.
Roberto Firmino swept in a finish from Mohamed Salah’s cross to equalize before a penalty-box melee following a corner saw the ball pop up off the shoulder of Salah, and Carvalho — a summer signing from Fulham — reacted quickest to smash into the roof of the net.
“I am not sure everyone in the stadium kept believing but from now on we have to,” Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp said. “What a wonderful goal from the little one.”
It was a second straight victory for Liverpool, which opened the season without winning any of its first three games.
SPURS UNBEATEN
Tottenham remained unbeaten after a 1-1 draw at West Ham, for whom club-record signing Lucas Paqueta missed a chance to score a late winner on his debut.
West Ham manager David Moyes said before kickoff that Paqueta had not so much as passed a ball to his new teammates after only completing his 52 million pound ($61.6 million) switch from Lyon on Monday.
With four minutes remaining, Vladimir Coufal pulled the ball back and Paqueta — on as a 67th-minute substitute — got in a mix-up with fellow new signing Emerson Palmieri as they left the ball to each other, 10 meters from goal, instead of taking a shot. Moyes fell to his knees on the touchline.
An own-goal from Thilo Kehrer gave Tottenham the lead before Tomas Soucek equalized.
In the other game, Bournemouth drew 0-0 at home to Wolverhampton, two days after firing manager Scott Parker."
71,sports,https://en.setopati.com/sports/159462,"Erling Haaland scored his first Premier League hat-trick as Manchester City came from two goals down to beat Crystal Palace 4-2 on Saturday.
City trailed 2-0 after just 21 minutes against a clinical Palace side — which was looking to its 2-0 win at the Etihad Stadium last season — after an own-goal by John Stones and a header by Joachim Andersen.
It was the fourth Premier League game out of the last six in which City had fallen two goals behind, but Pep Guardiola’s team had not lost any of the previous three and went on to win this one in style.
After Bernardo Silva pulled one back eight minutes into the second half, Haaland took over as his first home goals for City came in a hurry. He netted three in the space of 20 minutes to make it six in his first four Premier League matches.
Patrick Vieira was forced to name a starting 11 without Wilfried Zaha due to injury, but the absence of the star forward did not prevent Palace from storming into an early lead as Eberechi Eze’s free kick struck both Kyle Walker and Stones as it spun into the net.
Things got worse for City in the 22nd minute from another set piece. It was Eze again with a corner from which Andersen was left unmarked to power in a header.
Guardiola had been planning two substitutions early in the second half with Ilkay Gundogan and Julian Alvarez both stripped and ready to go, but they sat back down after Silva got City back into it in the 53rd minute.
The Portugal international cut in from the right before hitting a low shot which deflected off Jeffrey Schlupp on its way in.
Gundogan and Alvarez did come on just after the hour and Alvarez quickly made an impact as City leveled in the 62nd. He flicked on a deep cross to Phil Foden, who chipped the ball back in for Haaland, who got across Marc Guehi to head in his first Etihad goal.
Eight minutes later he had his second. From a short corner, Alvarez fed Silva who pulled the ball back for Stones and he rolled it across for Haaland to poke home from a yard out.
Haaland sealed his hat-trick with 10 minutes to go. Silva’s through ball found his run perfectly, and the Norwegian had the strength to hold off Joel Ward before firing into the bottom corner.
City now has 10 points from four games, with Palace left on four points."

Sterling’s second half double proved decisive at Stamford Bridge as the hosts overcame the early sending off of England midfielder Conor Gallagher.
Manager Thomas Tuchel was also absent as he was serving a touchline ban following his confrontation with Antonio Conte in the opening home match against Tottenham, while Gallagher was dismissed in the 28th minute after getting two yellow cards.
Chelsea was awarded an early penalty when Ruben Loftus-Cheek went down in the box, but referee Paul Tierney overturned his decision after Kai Havertz was adjudged to have been offside in the buildup.
Seven minutes before the break, the visitors thought they took the lead when Harvey Barnes headed home, but the effort was ruled out for a foul on Blues goalkeeper Edouard Mendy.
The hosts came close to breaking the deadlock four minutes later when Reece James struck the post with an effort from Sterling’s cross, then Jamie Vardy shot wide at the other end after good work by Youri Tielemans.
A little more than a minute after the restart, Sterling broke the deadlock with a shot from the edge of the area, after being found by Marc Cucurella.
The Blues, who introduced Cesar Azpilicueta at halftime, went from four at the back to three and looked more threatening.
They doubled their lead in the 63rd minute when Sterling tapped in James’ cross at the far post. However, the Foxes pulled one back three minutes later when Barnes beat Mendy at his near post.

Jurgen Klopp’s side started the campaign slowly, with surprise draws against Fulham and Crystal Palace compounded by Monday’s loss at rival Manchester United. But Liverpool’s fearsome attack looked back to its best at Anfield as the team recorded its first league win and Roberto Firmino and Luis Diaz both grabbed two goals.
It’s only the fifth time a team scored nine goals in the league, with Man United (twice) and Leicester the only previous teams to win 9-0.
Firmino, starting in place of suspended summer signing Darwin Nunez, produced a stunning first-half display, which began with Diaz heading home his clipped cross within three minutes of the kickoff.
Firmino then provided the assist for Harvey Elliott’s first league goal — a fizzing strike from distance that would have been goal of the day were it not for the Trent Alexander-Arnold stunner that followed.
The Brazil forward set up that goal and celebrated one of his own soon after when turning in a deflected cross -- his first league goal at Anfield since December 2020.
Virgil van Dijk powered home Liverpool’s fifth on the stroke of halftime, while the onslaught continued just after the break in the form of Chris Mepham’s own-goal.
Firmino grabbed a second of the afternoon before leaving to a standing ovation.
The goals did not stop there, though, as Fabio Carvalho scored his first for the club and Diaz grabbed his second."
74,sports,https://en.setopati.com/sports/159458,"Manchester United’s stand-in captain Bruno Fernandes made it back-to-back wins for Erik ten Hag’s team by scoring the only goal in a 1-0 victory over Southampton in the Premier League on Saturday.
Wearing the captain’s armband in place of the still-benched Harry Maguire, Fernandes steered in a cross from Diogo Dalot in the 55th minute as United followed up Monday’s win over Liverpool with another morale-boosting performance.
Having started the season with two straight losses — including a 4-0 drubbing at Brentford — United has now won consecutive league matches for the first time since February.
It was also the team’s first clean sheet of the season, thanks in part to David de Gea’s reflex save to keep out a header from Joe Aribo in the 66th.
It’s a result that will give a bit more breathing space to Ten Hag, the Dutch manager who faced a torrent of criticism and skepticism after the team’s dismal start to the campaign.
Ten Hag’s decisions to leave Maguire and star forward Cristiano Ronaldo on the bench were vindicated once again, with center-back pairing Lisandro Martinez and Raphael Varane looking solid in defense.
United did struggle to create quality chances in the first half, although Ten Hag was shaking his head in disbelief that his team didn’t go ahead in the 20th minute when they had three shots on goal from close range in the span of a few seconds.
Anthony Elanga’s effort from a tight angle was saved by goalkeeper Gavin Bazunu before Fernandes and Christian Eriksen both had their follow-up shots blocked by diving defenders.
Southampton had its best first-half chance on the half-hour mark when a corner fell to Armel Bella-Kotchap at the back post, but he lifted it over the crossbar.
United started stronger in the second half and got the goal after a well-worked move down the right flank. Dalot lifted a cross into the area and Fernandes was on hand to sidefoot it inside the far post.
Ronaldo and United’s new signing Casemiro — the Portugal star’s former teammate at Real Madrid — both came on in the second half.
Substitute Sekou Mara had two chances to equalize for Southampton in injury time, but his spectacular overhead kick was blocked by Dalot and he sidefooted another effort wide of the post a minute later."
75,sports,https://en.setopati.com/sports/159422,"Finally, there are signs of life at Manchester United.
Against a backdrop of protests against the club’s ownership, United delivered a performance of intensity and spirit to beat fierce rival Liverpool 2-1 on Monday and claim its first points in the Premier League this season.
Composed finishes by Jadon Sancho in the 16th minute and Marcus Rashford in the 53rd earned a victory at Old Trafford that will bring some respite for under-pressure manager Erik ten Hag, who made a huge statement in his team selection by dropping star striker Cristiano Ronaldo and club captain Harry Maguire and was validated.
“I wanted a different attitude and that is what I saw them bring on the pitch,” said Ten Hag, who has started his tenure at United amid something of a crisis at England’s biggest club. “But it’s only the start.”
Suddenly, the heat is on Liverpool — widely expected to be a title contender again this season — with Jürgen Klopp’s team still waiting for a win after three games and now languishing behind United in the standings on just two points.
Mohamed Salah scored an 81st-minute consolation but it was another below-par display from Liverpool after draws with Fulham and Crystal Palace, even if this was a first league loss in 2022.
“In the warm-up, it was the quietest I have heard this stadium and they wanted something to lift them,” Liverpool defender Andrew Robertson said. “And we gave them it.”
What is historically the biggest game in English soccer was preceded by a pre-match protest by thousands of United fans angry at the direction and state of the club under its owners of 17 years, the Glazer family.
The supporters called for the U.S-based Glazers to sell the club as they walked to Old Trafford then gathered on the concourse outside the storied stadium, in front of a large police presence. Many lingered as the match began.
The pressure was on United after losses to Brighton (2-1) and Brentford (4-0) to open the season, and the players fed off a frenzied atmosphere that seemed to affect Liverpool early on.
“The start of the game was exactly what everyone expected, what United fans expected. They were after us,” Klopp said. “They started slightly more aggressive than us.”
Lisandro Martinez, an offseason signing at center back who has come under enormous criticism in recent days, was particularly impressive and set the tone by clattering into Salah in the first minute, then barging into the Liverpool forward after getting up off the ground. Later in the first half, Raphael Varane, who replaced Maguire, virtually rugby-tackled Luis Diaz to the ground, to roars of approval from United’s fans even if it earned him a booking.
Sancho’s goal came in United’s best spell of the game, the winger showing great composure to trick James Milner by feigning to shoot, cut back inside and place a shot into the corner as Virgil van Dijk bizarrely stood motionless in front of him. It was the seventh straight Premier League match that Liverpool had fallen behind.
The stadium erupted again when Anthony Martial, a halftime substitute, played through Rashford and the striker sprinted toward the area before placing a calm finish inside the near post.
United had to defend stoutly at times but hung on to end an eight-match winless run against Liverpool and a losing streak of four matches in the league stretching back to the end of last season.
It’s down to United to string a run of similar battling performances together, starting at Southampton next weekend. Ten Hag will have Casemiro, whose $60 million signing from Real Madrid was completed Monday, available for that game and the Brazil midfielder was presented on the field before kickoff.
With more signings potentially arriving before the end of the transfer window, things might be looking up for the record 20-time English champions.
“We just have to produce like today in every single game,” Sancho said."
76,sports,https://en.setopati.com/sports/159418,"Manchester City was given a major scare by Newcastle before coming from behind to draw 3-3 in a thrilling Premier League game on Sunday.
City needed goals in the space of four minutes after the hour mark from Erling Haaland and Bernardo Silva to salvage a point at St. James’ Park and maintain the unbeaten start to its title defense.
Newcastle battered City for much of the first half and just after halftime, responding to going behind to Ilkay Gundogan’s fifth-minute strike with goals from Miguel Almiron, Callum Wilson and then a stunning free kick from Kieran Trippier in the 54th.
Rather than opt for damage limitation, Newcastle — inspired by the individual brilliance of Allan Saint-Maximin — decided attack was the best form of defense and it nearly paid off.
Ultimately it was a goal by Silva, starting for the first time in the league this season after being linked with a move to Barcelona in the summer, that saved City and it came off a brilliant through-ball from Kevin De Bruyne that took out three Newcastle players — going through the legs of one of them.
Newcastle also stayed unbeaten after three games and, funded by the riches of Saudi Arabia, will be proud of a statement display against the champions.
City started strongly, and Silva and Haaland had already combined ominously to allow Rodri to whistle a long-range strike over Nick Pope’s crossbar when the midfielder was allowed time and space to deliver a cross for Gundogan to control and fire past Pope.
The England goalkeeper had to save with his legs from De Bruyne and Phil Foden in quick succession with the visitors utterly dominant, although the home side should have leveled when Saint-Maximin cut the ball back for Almiron, who skied his shot.
Then Newcastle took over. Ederson had to save at full stretch to keep out Saint-Maximin before substitute Ruben Dias — on for the injured Nathan Ake — deflected Wilson’s attempt wide.
The respite proved temporary. Saint-Maximin tricked his way past Kyle Walker and Rodri down the left to cross to the far post where Almiron slid in to turn the ball home. The goal was ruled offside but it was overturned on review.
That Almiron was the scorer was poignant, given he was mocked by City midfielder Jack Grealish in post-title celebrations in May.
Joao Cancelo had to come to Ederson’s rescue after he had rashly raced from his line to confront Almiron and was easily rounded, but the Brazil goalkeeper was picking the ball out of his net once again six minutes before the break. Saint-Maximin cut inside and fed Wilson, who touched the ball back inside past Dias before dispatching it into the net with the outside of his right foot.
Haaland was unfortunate not to drag the visitors back level within seven minutes of the restart when his shot was tipped onto the foot of a post by Pope, and his misery was compounded two minutes later when the home side extended their lead.
John Stones was penalized for bringing down the flying Saint-Maximin 22 meters out and Trippier’s free kick gave Ederson little chance.
Haaland blasted City back into it from close range from Rodri’s flick back into the area and should have helped himself to a second three minutes later, but was denied by Pope’s legs.
City was level, however, seconds later when De Bruyne picked out Silva’s run.
Trippier was shown a straight red card by referee Jarred Gillett for a cynical trip on De Bruyne, but the official was advised to review the incident and reduced the punishment to a yellow."
77,sports,https://en.setopati.com/sports/159415,"A bad error by goalkeeper Edouard Mendy prompted a collapse by Chelsea in a 3-0 loss at Leeds on Sunday featuring a first Premier League goal by American winger Brenden Aaronson.
The late sending-off of center back Kalidou Koulibaly completed a miserable afternoon at a lively Elland Road for Chelsea, which fell to a first loss of the season.
It was Aaronson who applied pressure on Mendy after the Senegal international received a back pass in the 33rd minute. Mendy took a slightly heavy touch and tried to go around Aaronson, who dispossessed him and walked the ball into the net to make it 1-0.
Rodrigo glanced home a header from Jack Harrison’s free kick in the 37th minute and the roles were reversed for the third goal in the 69th, when Rodrigo arrived in the area to meet a cross with a mis-hit shot that was turned in from close range by Harrison.
Koulibaly, one of Chelsea’s offseason signings, received his second yellow card in the 84th for pulling back the jersey of substitute Joe Gelhardt.
Chelsea’s poor performance contrasted sharply with its impressive display in a 2-2 draw with Tottenham last weekend and highlighted a number of weaknesses in its squad.
Notably in attack, where manager Thomas Tuchel looks to be short after letting go Romelu Lukaku and Timo Werner and only bringing in Raheem Sterling from Manchester City. Sterling had a goal disallowed in the first half and also missed a great early chance.
Chelsea also has a shortage of center backs — the suspension of Koulibaly won’t help — as well as issues in midfield, with N’Golo Kante and Mateo Kovacic injured.
Leeds has opened with two wins and a draw in manager Jesse Marsch’s first full season in charge.
Spain striker Rodrigo has four goals, making him the top scorer in the league."
78,sports,https://en.setopati.com/sports/159377,"Two glaring misses then a red card for a reckless headbutt.
It was a home debut to forget for Liverpool’s big offseason signing, Darwin Núñez.
Fortunately for the Reds, another South American came to the rescue at Anfield as a dazzling individual goal by Luis Díaz salvaged a 1-1 draw against Crystal Palace in the Premier League on Monday.
In his first competitive start for Liverpool, Núñez lost control after jostling with Joachim Andersen off the ball and thrust his head into the face of the Palace defender, with referee Paul Tierney watching on close by in the 57th minute.
The red card was immediately brandished and Núñez had to be calmed down by his teammates as he attempted to confront Tierney. Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp blanked Núñez as the Uruguay striker headed down the tunnel.
“It’s a red card,” Klopp said. “He was provoked all the time but that is not how to behave.”
Núñez, an offseason signing from Benfica, earned his first start after a couple of impressive, goalscoring displays off the bench in the Community Shield against Manchester City and then against Fulham, and also because Roberto Firmino was missing through injury.
He missed a very presentable early chance against Palace by miscuing a close-range volley at the back post, and then hit the post from a similar range in the final minute of the first half.
Maybe some frustration had set by the time he was red-carded. As they jostled at the edge of Palace’s penalty area, Núñez threw his head back at Andersen and missed. Then, when confronted moments later by the aggrieved defender, Núñez turned into Andersen and butted him square in the face.
Already trailing because of Wilfried Zaha’s 32nd-minute goal, Liverpool was really up against it. But even down to 10 men, Klopp’s team still dominated possession and Díaz earned his team a point by cutting in from the left, slipping between two defenders, and curling a shot into the far corner in front of the Kop. The Colombia international’s goal came four minutes after the red card.
“Sometimes you need a moment of brilliance,” Liverpool midfielder James Milner said, “and when you have players like Luis on the pitch, he can create something out of nothing. It was an incredible goal.”
Palace relied almost exclusively on the counterattack throughout the match and it was from that means that Zaha opened the scoring, breaking the offside trap to latch onto Eberechi Eze’s through-ball and curl a finish into the far corner.
Zaha missed a great chance to snatch a win when he stretched to meet a cross late in the game and hit the post.
Liverpool has now drawn its first two games — Klopp’s team was held 2-2 by Fulham in the opening weekend — and is already four points behind Manchester City and Arsenal, the early pacesetters.
Its third match will be at Old Trafford next Monday against a beleaguered Manchester United team that has lost both of its games.
Núñez will be suspended for that, while Klopp is set to be without a slew of key players, with the likes of Thiago Alcantara, Diogo Jota, Ibrahima Konaté and Joel Matip currently out injured. Firmino missed the game as a precaution, according to Liverpool, so could be fit in a week’s time.
“Everything went against us during the week,” Klopp said. “It was crazy — it was like a witch was in the building. Every time somebody else had problems and then putting in such a performance, especially in the circumstances, I’m really proud.”"
79,sports,https://en.setopati.com/sports/159369,"Antonio Conte and Thomas Tuchel were both sent off after clashing following the final whistle of a feisty 2-2 draw between Chelsea and Tottenham featuring an equalizer in the sixth minute of stoppage time by Spurs striker Harry Kane on Sunday.
As they shook hands on the field, Tuchel seemed to not let go of his grip and intimated that Conte look him in the eyes. Pushing and shoving ensued, just as there had been between the two managers in the technical area during the match at Stamford Bridge. They were then shown red cards.
Conte celebrated Tottenham’s first equalizer, by Pierre-Emile Højbjerg in the 68th minute, by barging into the chest of Tuchel, sparking a melee among the two sets of coaching staff.
Then, after Reece James put Chelsea back in front in the 77th, Tuchel set off on a sprint past Conte and down the touchline, clenching his fist in pure delight.
Kane’s goal came in the sixth of seven added-on minutes, the striker glancing in a header that took a touch off the thigh of James before going into the net.
Kalidou Koulibaly had put Chelsea ahead in the 19th minute by meeting a deep corner from Marc Cucurella with a stunning volley that flew high into the net for his first goal since joining in the offseason from Napoli.
Tottenham, which only came to life after the introduction of Richarlison, ended a run of five straight losses to Chelsea in all competitions but remained stuck on just one victory at Stamford Bridge since the Premier League started in 1992.

Mistakes by goalkeeper David De Gea gifted the first two goals to Josh Dasilva and Mathias Jensen, Ben Mee nodded in the third at a corner and Bryan Mbeumo hit a slick fourth on the counterattack on a chastening afternoon for the visitors.
Ten Hag, who joined from Ajax in the offseason, had insisted before the game that he was not panicking despite United’s lack of new signings but the Dutchman must be worried about this humiliating result, coming a week after a 2-1 home loss to Brighton.
It was a defeat largely of United’s own making.
Ten Hag had turned to Cristiano Ronaldo to lead the attack, having started the Portugal star on the bench against Brighton.
But the problems were all at the other end, as United imploded after only 10 minutes thanks to the first mistake from De Gea.
The Spaniard allowed Dasilva’s weak long-range shot to squirm through his hands and roll into the net.
De Gea was at fault again eight minutes later, passing to the under-pressure Christian Eriksen as United attempted to play out from the back.
Jensen was alive to the unravelling situation in the United defense and nipped in to rob Eriksen, cut inside and double the lead.
It was a sweet moment for the Bees fans, with Eriksen having spent the second half of last season with Brentford following his recovery from cardiac arrest, only to opt for supposed bigger and better things at United.
It certainly does not look like panning out that way for the Denmark international just yet.
The drinks break in sweltering conditions gave Ten Hag the chance to try to sort out the mess unfolding in front of him, while Bees boss Thomas Frank brought out a tactics board.
There was no change and on the half hour, Mee, an offseason signing from Burnley, bundled in a header at the far post after United failed to deal with a corner headed back into the danger area by Ivan Toney.
Five minutes later, Toney was given space to race forward down the left and tee up strike partner Mbeumo, who beat Luke Shaw before firing home.
With the heat undoubtedly a factor, United got some respite in the second half and Eriksen managed a couple of attempts on goal — a header held by goalkeeper David Raya and a volley skewed wide — both to loud cheers from the partying Brentford fans."
81,sports,https://en.setopati.com/sports/159356,"Gabriel Jesus didn’t take long to make an impression at the Emirates stadium.
The Brazil striker marked his home debut for Arsenal with two goals and two assists in a 4-2 win against Leicester in the Premier League on Saturday.
Jesus, who joined from Manchester City as Arsenal’s marquee summer signing so far, opened his account for the Gunners in the 23rd minute with a brilliant, curling finish. He got his second in the 35th from a header and had several chances to finish the game at Emirates Stadium with a hat trick.
The two times Leicester found itself back in the match, Arsenal responded right away.
The visitors made it 2-1 from an own goal by William Saliba in the 53rd, but Arsenal midfielder Granit Xhaka restored the home side’s two-goal cushion two minutes later. Xhaka scored after Jesus poked a loose ball into his path after Leicester goalkeeper Danny Ward failed to hold on to a routine cross into the box and collided with defender Wesley Fofana.
Leicester attacking midfielder James Maddison made it 3-2 in the 74th when he sent a low shot through the legs of Arsenal goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale.
A nervous murmur went through the crowd, but the Arsenal team didn’t panic as it did in similar situations in recent seasons. Jesus drove forward just a minute later and squared the ball to forward Gabriel Martinelli, who fired a left-footed shot from just outside the area to beat Ward at the back post to make it 4-2.
Leicester also had a penalty decision overturned just before halftime after the referee first pointed to the spot and then was asked to review a coming together of Ramsdale and Leicester forward Jamie Vardy in the box.
On a hot day when the mercury hit around 33 C (91 F), six goals and the pace of the game took a lot out of the players and water breaks were needed in each half. The result means that Arsenal has won both of its opening league games, with Leicester drawing its first match.
Jesus was the focus of Arsenal’s attack throughout the match, with teammates trying to get him the ball at every opportunity. For his first goal, he took one touch after receiving a pass from Xhaka, set himself and then bent a shot that took a slight deflection to sail in past Ward.
Jesus got a bit of help for his second from Vardy. The Leicester forward flicked the ball backward across the face of goal from a corner, and Jesus headed into an empty net at the back post.
The striker nearly scored a hat trick before halftime when he dominated Leicester defender Jonny Evans with his back to goal, spun around him into the box and fired a low shot saved by Ward. He had multiple chances in the second half as well.
Unlike Arsenal, Leicester has been very quiet in the transfer market. The team only announced its first signing of the transfer window on the eve of Saturday’s match. Alex Smithies, a 32-year-old backup goalkeeper who most recently played for Cardiff, signed with the Foxes on a two-year deal."
82,sports,https://en.setopati.com/sports/159355,"Erling Haaland might not hog all of Manchester City’s goals this season, after all.
Ilkay Gundogan, Kevin De Bruyne and Phil Foden were City’s scorers — along with an own-goal — in a 4-0 win over Bournemouth in the Premier League on Saturday, with Haaland barely getting a sight on goal at Etihad Stadium.
The Norway striker scored both of City’s goals in its opening-weekend 2-0 win at West Ham but was mostly crowded out a week later as Bournemouth sat deep with plenty of men behind the ball in a match that resembled an attack vs defense training exercise.
City’s midfielders reaped the benefits of the extra focus on Haaland.
Gundogan’s goal did involve City’s new star striker, with Haaland holding off his marker with his back to goal and clipping a ball through to the Germany midfielder. Gundogan’s left-footed finish found the bottom corner in the 19th for his 50th goal for City.
De Bruyne scored the pick of the goals, the playmaker cutting inside on a counterattack led by Foden in the 31st, beating a defender and bending his shot with the outside of his right foot into the far corner.
De Bruyne returned the favor for Foden six minutes later, slipping a brilliant pass through the legs of a defender and into the path of his teammate, who took a touch and fired in a deflected shot that beat goalkeeper Mark Travers.
Haaland’s best chance fell in the 73rd when he mishit a first-time shot wide from Jack Grealish’s cut-back. The striker was substituted moments later.
The scoring was completed by Jefferson Lerma, who unwittingly turned a cross from Joao Cancelo into his own net from inside Bournemouth’s six-yard box.
It was a wake-up call for Bournemouth after the promoted team started the season with a surprisingly comfortable 2-0 win over Aston Villa last weekend.
City manager Pep Guardiola again chose to start with Bernardo Silva on the bench. The Portugal midfielder has been linked with a move to Barcelona and didn’t start against West Ham, either."
83,view,https://en.setopati.com/view/157157,"Industry Minister Gajendra Hamal has resigned 40 hours after appointment. Hamal has said he has resigned listening to his conscience after widespread criticism of the appointment. Baluwatar has tried to spin the resignation by Hamal of his own volition to save its face. The press note issued by Baluwatar mentions that Hamal has resigned on request of Prime Minister (PM) Sher Bahadur Deuba even as audio recording of Hamal requesting to broadcast/publish the issue through the media pointing that Deuba may reject his resignation has been made public.
One fact has been irrefutably established despite all the efforts of damage control by Baluwatar. The democracy in Nepal has been attacked in an unimaginable manner last week.
Politicians and people in the judiciary can some time commit mistakes in course of work and do work that should not be done. But the deed of PM Deuba and Chief Justice (CJ) Cholendra Shumsher Rana with consent of the top leaders of ruling coalition is an unthinkable crime in democracy. CJ seeking share of spoils in the government and the ruling parties accepting that is unimaginable in democracy.
The main source of this misdeed is CJ Rana, and his unconstitutional aspirations. Rana had the temerity to seek a share in power violating the sanctity of judiciary believing he can do anything he wishes.
The ruling coalition should have strongly resisted this impudence by CJ Rana. But the coalition easily accepted his demand reflecting at once the gratitude of the coalition toward some of the past verdicts by CJ and fear that he may put the government in another crisis.
Rana has been enjoying the fallout of the havoc he has wreaked from the sacred chair of CJ and making mockery of democracy. It is not hard to see that Rana has been influencing the court’s verdicts in a way that benefits one party or another, and reaping political benefits for that.
Two major verdicts by the Supreme Court (SC) in cases related to political parties are now under suspicion. The SC verdict to revoke unification of CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Center) restoring the two parties to the state before unification in a case related to the unified party using name of another registered party was against the Constitution, laws and jurisdiction of the judiciary. That verdict was unimaginable.  
The refusal by the SC to issue an interim order in the case against the ordinance making splitting of parties easier issued hastily by the Deuba government after suddenly ending the House session, and subsequent delay in issuing final verdict in the case have also raised suspicions. Every government has undermined the parliament by bringing ordinance and tampered with laws for its vested interests. There will be no meaning of democratic norms of the people’s representatives formulating laws and the rule of law if that is not controlled.
The SC recently had revoked the ordinance brought by the KP Oli government to amend the act related to citizenship immediately after dissolving the House. The court had done a commendable job of curbing the autocratic tendency of the executive to rule through ordinances by avoiding the parliament. The final verdict in that case would have set a good precedent and curbed abuse of powers bolstering democracy and rule of law.
But the SC has again treaded the wrong path in the case related to the ordinance about splitting of parties. The SC has blatantly ignored the precedent it established in the ordinance related to citizenship. The double standard of the Apex Court in cases related to two similar ordinances has not just hit the credibility of the judiciary but raised suspicions that CJ Rana influences court verdicts to serve his immoral interests in connivance with political parties. CJ Rana has himself proved the suspicions to be true by accepting his share in Cabinet expansion.
Opposing such immoral acts of CJ is not opposing the judiciary or attacking the dignity of the court. The judiciary is not an individual justice or CJ, for that matter, who does not remain within the limits and disregards the sanctity of the judiciary.
Condemning such justices rather saves the judiciary and all those honest justices who continuously work with constitutional integrity and cannot even think about treading the path Rana has taken. Slamming Rana will save the justices who twice revived the House dissolved unconstitutionally by Oli going against Rana’s wishes. Criticizing Rana will safeguard the public trust over those very justices who have not participated in the political dealmaking of Rana.
We should not forget here that CJ Rana agreed to reinstate the House for the first time only after three justices in the five-strong constitutional bench stood for House reinstatement. Two justices refused to stay in the constitutional bench formed by CJ Rana in the case against the second dissolution by Oli. The rest of the justices then forced Rana to constitute the bench on the basis of seniority. The constitutional bench formed on the basis of seniority then reinstated the House.  
The current transgression by Rana has provided an opportunity to UML leaders to claim that the verdict for House reinstatement was also given on the basis of political machination. Rana in this way has not just dragged other SC justices working with honesty and integrity into suspicion but also gravely reduced the credibility of the judiciary.
CJ Rana would have deserved impeachment if politicians at the top were not complicit in such grave crimes. Merely demanding share in government would be sufficient to impeach a CJ in a well-functioning democracy. But our politicians are so lowly and decadent that they are condemned to fulfilling the quota demanded by CJ in appointments in the government and constitutional bodies. Oli gave Rana share in appointments in constitutional bodies when he was PM. Deuba gave Rana a share even in the Cabinet this time.
Our politicians will not muster moral courage to impeach Rana due to this background. The responsibility to resist the immoral deeds of Rana is now on the judiciary itself. The SC justices, the Nepal Bar Association, and the SC Bar Association must seriously carry out consultations. Such incidents erode the legitimacy of democracy and undermine rule of law, and the courageous stand of people with integrity and honesty at such times will instill life in democracy and save democracy.
Nepali Congress (NC) that considers itself to be the mother of parliamentary democracy in Nepal and its leaders and cadres also have a huge responsibility. Maoist Center Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who does not respect or believe in parliamentary democracy a bit, defending Hamal’ appointment is not surprising because he believes all the means toward climbing to power and staying are fair. But NC leaders and cadres should seriously contemplate whether corruption of the executive by an immoral and whimsical CJ is acceptable in parliamentary democracy or not? Whether the party president who has committed such a grave attack and crime against democracy is acceptable or not? Whether the party president can continue to lead the party and government in the coming days or not? Why should the Nepali people bear with Deuba who undermines democracy, Constitution and the party ideals every time he reaches power even if the party leaders and cadres consider him fit to be party president? Why should NC under Deuba again be sent to the government?
The coming days will show how people in the judiciary retaliate against CJ’s arbitrariness or those in NC will resist Deuba. But one thing is absolutely clear. Deuba and Rana, and not Hamal, are the ones who should be punished in this episode. The attack on democracy by PM Deuba and CJ Rana, who have repeatedly failed to maintain clean image even in the past, this time has plummeted their image to the nadir of ignominy. History will not absolve them of this ignominy."

85,view,https://en.setopati.com/view/160810,"Kathmandu Mayor Balen Shah has issued instruction to not pick garbage from the Singha Durbar and the Shital Niwas from Saturday. Waste materials are starting to pile up at the country’s administrative center and other sensitive areas of the state after his instruction to Paribartan Nepal, a private company that has been collecting garbage.  
“Garbage of Singha Durbar will not be picked from today. Leaders there will have to be dumped at Sisdole if the country really has to be cleaned,” Shah had posted on Facebook Saturday to inform about stopping garbage collection.
Both the expression and the deed of Shah are irresponsible and anarchic.
Those in public position should not just fulfill their responsibilities but also maintain decorum of their post. They should also think about dignity of others. What does he actually mean by ‘leaders from Singha Durbar will have to be dumped at Sisdole if the country really has to be cleaned’? This is absolutely anarchic and apolitical expression in itself. This says more about Shah himself than other leaders.
Leaders, whether seated at the Singha Durbar or the Bag Durbar, have both strengths and weaknesses. People have elected them to their respective posts expecting them to resolve the country’s problems remaining within their limits and maintaining dignity.
Shah seems to suffer from this mental illness that only he is right and all the others deserve to be dumped at Sisdole. He can criticize the works of others and also recommend to work in a certain manner. He can offer support but cannot run away from his responsibilities by abusing and blaming others.
He posted a defense of his decision to not pick garbage from the Singha Durbar on Monday listing the works in which 14 ministries of the federal government did not cooperate with him. The majority of the issues he has raised are beyond his jurisdiction. He has stake in them in capacity of a citizen and a mayor, and can also speak about them or provide suggestion. But he cannot stop picking of garbage from the Prime Minister’s Office and the President’s Office citing lack of cooperation by others in issues not in his jurisdiction.  
Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) not picking garbage from the Prime Minister’s Office and the President’s Office is as unimaginable and irresponsible as the federal government stopping budget allocated for the KMC or not sending staffers citing lack of support from mayor.
Let us look at some of the issues he says that the federal government has not cooperated on. He has said that he met different ministers once or twice and talked about issues ranging from the program of bringing Melamchi water round the year to Kathmandu by connecting Yangri and Larke rivers to Melamchi to management of Melamchi water and pipeline, appropriate management of the Kathmandu Upatyaka Khanepani Limited (KUKL), procurement of fertilizers for the farmers, cooperative regulations and laws, expansion of the Ring Road, sanitation of public hospitals, insurance, implementation of the Supreme Court (SC) order to demolish the top story of the Health Ministry, and even passing the map of airport.
He has stated that he reached the conclusion to not pick garbage from the Singha Durbar as the problems have not been resolved and there was no appropriate coordination despite his efforts for nine months.
Some of the issues and works he has raised may be of concern for him but definitely not in his jurisdiction. Those problems will not be resolved merely after him meeting the ministers and talking with them. The line ministries and government bodies work in their own manner and there may be dalliance and lack of appropriate coordination in some of those works. There may even be corruption in some of those works. But that all comes down to the capacity of our overall state system. That is precisely why we are in the current state.
If a mere meeting of the mayor with the ministers were to resolve those problems, they would not have remained unresolved until now in the first place. There is an error in the thinking that problems remain only because nobody wants them resolved. To think all seated at the Singha Durbar are crooks and say that they deserve to be dumped at Sisdole is his hubris and madness. 
Why many problems that the KMC can resolve on its own remain as they were if the problems facing the country could be resolved magically as he seems to think or if mere good intentions were to suffice? Has the KMC completed all the works that it can do on its own?
The KMC has not been able to resolve many problems that many other metropolitan cities have resolved.
Let us look at a small example. There is problem of squatters in almost all the metropolitan cities of the country. There are genuine and fake squatters in all metropolitan cities. It is necessary to first ascertain who out of them are genuine squatters and who are not to resolve the problem. Record must be collected by going to the squatter settlements for that. It is the responsibility of the metropolitan cities to do that. The state has formulated a policy to address those identified as genuine squatters in that manner. The state accepts that it has responsibility toward them. It is basic responsibility of the state even from the perspective of social justice. Many metropolitan cities have moved forward toward resolving the problem after collecting record of squatters but the KMC is not ready to collect record of squatters. It contends that all of them are encroachers and their record, therefore, should not be collected. Shah stresses on removing them even at the cost of a bloody clash deploying excavators and the police. He has made many attempts to that regard. The KMC has been forced to take a step back after clash with the squatters on each occasion.
His main gripe with the Singha Durbar is lack of mobilization of police to exercise force on the squatters. A civilized state that believes in social justice never can, and should, support him in this wrong objective.  
Mayor Balen Shah suffers from this attitude that all he thinks and believes in is right, and all others think and believe in is wrong, and only he is right and all others are wrong. His prescription of dumping all others at Sisdole to develop the country is manifestation of that attitude.
KMC is not just Balen Shah. It also has other elected representatives. He seems to have unilaterally taken the decision to not pick garbage from the Singha Durbar and the Shital Niwas without consulting anyone.  Deputy mayor and the ward chair concerned have confirmed that the mayor’s decision was made without informing them. The other elected people’s representatives of KMC also cannot evade this issue now. They must speak clearly whether what he has done is right or wrong. They must form a position as to whether to do so in the pretext of cooperation from the federal government is right or not.
Let us assume that the Prime Minister’s Office and the ministries actually did not cooperate. Why drag the office of the constitutional president in this? How is the office of the head of state connected to this? Why was the prestige of that office not considered even a bit?
 Let the other elected representatives of KMC and the federal government speak clearly to Mayor Shah. Let the federal government immediately provide support and coordination it can in the works of KMC. Not just the KMC but even other local bodies and provincial government have been facing obstruction in their works in lack of necessary laws and downward delegation of the rights. Let the federal government work for resolving that as soon as possible.
Let everyone remind Mayor Balen Shah of his limits, the dignity and responsibilities of mayoralty; tell him that federal, provincial and local governments must move forward with mutual support, coordination and cooperation; and remind him that problems cannot be resolved by blaming and abusing one another."
86,view,https://en.setopati.com/view/160679,"Who are the 4,000 or so persons that CPN (Maoist Center) wants to pay Rs 200,000 each to from the state coffers?
The Maoists claim that these 4,000 persons are combatants who participated in the armed conflict. They were due financial package as per the spirit of the peace agreement. But they were not provided the package by labeling them disqualified on different pretexts and they suffered injustice. They could neither be integrated in the Nepal Army (NA) nor were paid by the state. It is, therefore, necessary to pay them even 15 years after the peace agreement as per the spirit of the peace process.
The Cabinet meeting on March 20 decided to provide Rs 200,000 each to them and has sent the decision to the Home Ministry. Home Secretary Binod Prakash Singh has told the Rastriya Samachar Samiti that the ministry is preparing a working procedure for distributing the money.
Some of the Nepali Congress (NC) leaders say that they have been told by Prime Minister (PM) Pushpa Kamal Dahal that such a decision has not been taken. PM Dahal himself, however, has not spoken publicly about the issue. It can, therefore, be understood that the process of distributing relief has moved forward.
Are the 4,000 persons that the Maoists want to pay with the taxpayers’ money really combatants? We have to look at the background of the peace process to understand that.
The seven political parties and the Maoists on November 8, 2006 had agreed to keep Maoist combatants in the main cantonments at Kailali, Surkhet, Rolpa, Palpa, Kavre, Sindhuli and Ilam districts, and that the combatants would be verified and monitored by the UN to hold peaceful and fair Constituent Assembly Election without any fear, and democratization and restructuring of the Nepal Army as per the spirit of the 12-point agreement, 8-point agreement, 25-point code of conduct, and the five-point letter sent to the UN on August 9, 2006.
The peace agreement signed on November 21, 2006 after that had agreed to keep the Maoist combatants and their weapons in the cantonments.
The agreement for monitoring of management of the weapons and combatants on December 6, 2006 then set standards for Maoist combatants. A person must have joined the Maoists before May 25, 2006, and be born before May 25, 1988 to qualify as a combatant during the verification process.
The cut-off date of birth was kept to be prior to May 25, 1988 to ensure that they would have completed at least 18 years on the cut-off date for joining the Maoist army.  An agreement, in other words, was reached that a minor younger than 18 years would not be recognized as a combatant. Using child soldiers in war is a crime even under international laws which deem those leading such wars to have committed a crime.
The Maoists sent a total of 32,350 persons to seven main cantonments and 21 sub-cantonments spread across the country saying they were combatants after the agreement for monitoring of management of the weapons and combatants on December 6, 2006.
The United Nations Mission in Nepal (UNMIN) then started the verification process to determine who out of them were combatants, and who were not. Most of them were not combatants and had left the cantonments even before verification.    
A total of 8,640 of those in the cantonments did not even turn up for the second stage of interview for verification of combatants.
UNMIN finally verified 19,602 of them to be combatants. Only 17,076 of them were present in the first stage of reclassification.
A total of 15,630 Maoist combatants then opted for voluntary retirement and returned home with Rs 500,000-800,000 while 1,422 were integrated in the Nepal Army. The 4,008 persons who UNMIN verified were not combatants left the cantonments without any payment. Because no agreement said that they would be paid after being found that they were not combatants.
How had they reached the cantonments then?
The number of combatants who had fought in the Maoist armed conflict was actually very low. A video of Maoist supremo Dahal talking about the numbers during a speech in the Shaktikhor cantonment had become public back then. Dahal had conceded in Shaktikhor that the Maoists actually had only around 7,000 combatants and taken pride in having been able to keep 30,000-35,000 persons in the cantonments fooling the state.   
The 4,008 expelled by UNMIN included their thousands of cadres and their children who were sent to the cantonments by the Maoists saying they would get relief package from the state.
Many of those 4,008 expelled by UNMIN saying they were not combatants had not completed 18 years until May 25, 2006. A total of 1,973 were below 18 years while 1,035 others could not prove that they had joined the Maoist army before the cut-off date of May 25, 2006 for joining the Maoist army even though they had completed 18.
UNMIN did not even investigate whether the 1,973 minors had joined the Maoist army or not. It first investigated age, and said that those who were underage were not eligible to become combatants without checking when they had been recruited.
It was difficult to go there even for UNMIN because verifying that child soldiers were recruited by the Maoists would have meant that the Maoist leadership had committed the crime of using child soldiers. That would have attracted international laws. UNMIN, therefore, did not venture there, and the Maoist leadership was freed from the accusation of using child soldiers for then.
If the Maoist leadership now insists that they were indeed combatants and participated in the armed conflict and hence should be compensated, that would establish that the Maoists had used child soldiers in the conflict. Is the Maoist leadership ready to face the consequences of accepting to have used child soldiers in the conflict?
UNMIN had not strictly investigated even the adult combatants then. Those who could answer a few simple questions were verified to be combatants. Over 19,000 were, therefore, verified to be combatants even though Dahal had conceded in the Shaktikhor video that the Maoists actually had only around 7,000 combatants. The state spent around Rs 20 billion in their management and integration. There was embezzlement of billions in the name of running the Maoist cantonments. The advance of Rs 460 million taken by Maoist leader Krishna Bahadur Mahara for the combatants at cantonments was never reimbursed.
Everyone turned a blind eye to that to establish peace in the country and bring the Maoists into the mainstream. How necessary that was would perhaps be evaluated by history.
But the way the Maoists have continued their efforts to dole out taxpayers’ money to their cadres even after joining mainstream politics and 16 years after the peace deal is condemnable.
This is not the first time that attempts have ben made to give those 4,000 persons Rs 200,000 each. The Maoists had first made the attempt in 2012 when its leader Baburam Bhattarai was PM. It was made again when there was a coalition government including CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Center) in 2016.
Finance Minister Bishnu Paudel in the then KP Sharma Oli government had allocated Rs 840 million to pay Rs 200,000 each to the disqualified combatants and to those who had opted for voluntary retirement but had not received the lump sum in the budget for the fiscal year 2073/74.
That distribution was stopped when a few NC cadres and conflict victims moved the Supreme Court (SC) against the decision.
Dahal has now become PM for the third time. It has already been 15 years since he first became PM. It may not have been unnatural for him to have more rebellious attitude and less responsibility toward the state. But the determination showed by Dahal to try to pay his cadres from the state coffers when he has become PM for the third time is irresponsible. It shows that he has failed to understand the sensitivity of current times and his responsibility toward the general public.
The country is currently in a difficult economic situation. Not only Nepal, the whole world is affected by recession. In South Asia, all countries except India are going through a difficult economic situation. Those countries, including Nepal, have taken assistance from the International Monetary Fund to sustain the economy.
The recession has also affected the market and the general public. Many businesses have not been able to pay salaries on time. Many have furloughed their staff. The businesses themselves are in a tight spot as they are not able to pay the bank’s interest. Then there’s the mental stress of those with fixed income who have to pay installments to banks. The government has not been able to collect revenues due to the recession. If the situation worsens further, a situation could arise where it would be difficult to provide salaries to employees and to service debts.
What message will it send to the general public when the PM wants to dole out nearly a billion rupees from the state coffers to his cadres in the name of combatants at a time when he should be leading the job of extricating the country from this economic challenge?
What do coalition partner NC and NC leaders who are ironing their daura-suruwals to join the government say about it? On what basis will NC, which was against it when it was in the opposition in the past, support it now? Maybe it will now be opposed by UML, which had tried to provide Rs 200,000 each to these 4,000 people to appease the Maoists by including it in the budget itself. Trust in parties has deteriorated almost to a point of no return because of this double standard.
Let’s call a spade a spade, whether in the government or in the opposition.
The Maoists won’t be able to justify in any way the rationale behind their plan to distribute the tax money collected from the public’s hard work to their cadres. There has been no agreement in the past to provide money from the state coffers to those who were not combatants. The Maoists should put a stop to such attempts at recklessly imposing a burden on the state coffers and splurging on its cadres in the name of peace agreement."
87,view,https://en.setopati.com/view/160246,"Parliamentary system, they say, gives two governments to the voters at one go: one is the government that takes over the reins of power and the other the government-in-waiting.
The government that takes over power performs in accordance with the commitments made to the people. The parliamentary system expects that the government works for the people and their benefits.
But the parties that assume powers do not necessarily always abide by these democratic ideals. They often don't do so going by our own experience. The government has its own interests and compulsions, and the leaders of the parties also have their own agendas and interests. They often put their own agendas above the interests of the people and the country. The government prevails over the people and their fundamental rights at such times, and tries to curtail the people's rights to serve its own interests.
The voters in parliamentary democracy, therefore, also elect the main opposition party or the government-in-waiting to stop such despotic whims of the government. Parliamentary system is such a system of balance that puts the strongest party or coalition in power, and the next strongest party in the opposition so that the despotic whims of the government are challenged; it can strongly stand in the House for the people's rights and their daily lives, and compliance of the Constitution and laws to stop those in power from abusing the Constitution and the laws.  
The ruling party also fears the opposition party, aware that it is the government-in-waiting. The ruling party is always alert about the possibility of the people bringing it down from power and putting the main opposition party in power in the next election.
Nepali Congress (NC), which calls itself the defender of parliamentary democracy, has demolished this beautiful balance of power inherent in the parliamentary system.
NC President and Parliamentary Party Leader Sher Bahadur Deuba has shirked the immense role and responsibilities of the main opposition party to participate in the unholy wagering for power. Setopati reminds him that the politicians that run away from the august role of the main opposition leader also do not have any moral grounds to take over the reins of power tomorrow.
Having contested the election forging an electoral alliance with the promise of forming the government from the same coalition, Deuba failed to give the government promised to the people. His greed for power was mainly to blame for the unraveling of that coalition after he broke his promise to make CPN (Maoist Center) Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal prime minister (PM) first and tried to become PM instead, thereby forcing Dahal to take refuge at Balkot. Deuba has again started to wager for power after a new ruling coalition was formed comprising CPN-UML, Maoist Center and five other parties.
Deuba and those close to him seem to have hoped for Maoist support during the presidential election for now, and aspired for eventually breaking the current coalition in the long run. The way in which NC leader Ram Chandra Paudel has openly defended the decision to give vote of confidence to Dahal hints as much. The way Paudel has been abandoning his ideals for personal interests in recent times is appalling.
Dahal also seems to want to have the cake and eat it too by acquiring support from the two parties larger than his. He reached Deuba's new residence at Dhumbarahi after going to KP Sharma Oli's at Balkot as per that strategy.
It is not hard to see through Dahal's strategy of keeping his post safe scaring Oli by showing Deuba and vice versa. The course of this strategy, however, will end after the presidential election. He must choose one out of NC and UML in the presidential election.    
NC has deviated from the spirit of the parliamentary system of either forming the government or playing a strong role of opposition respecting the people's mandate at a time when the system has come under vehement attack, and the limits and dignity of democracy have been increasingly crossed by everyone.
Our Constitution has not authorized the PM to dissolve the House as long as the final alternative to give the government remains. But Oli twice dissolved the House crossing the limits of the Constitution that he himself prepared with wanton abandon, and the Supreme Court rightly reinstated the House deeming the dissolution unconstitutional on both the occasions.
But Oli shamelessly tried to defend his unconstitutional step of dissolving the House from the rostrum of the very sovereign House on Monday and Tuesday.
On the other hand, President Bidya Devi Bhandari has repeatedly put herself above the Constitution and Parliament. The Constitution has not given her the right to obstruct any work of the Cabinet or defy its decisions. But Bhandari has been sitting on two ordinances passed by the Cabinet. By refusing to authenticate a bill passed by Parliament, she has behaved in a manner to suggest she is above the sovereign Parliament elected by the people.
Oli, who himself flouted the Constitution, and his party have publicly defended the president’s actions. UML has lost the moral right to protest if a president elected with the support of another party were to disobey the decisions of a government under its leadership tomorrow.
The moral turpitude seen in parties who are major proponents of this system and Constitution during such attacks on the Constitution and the system has become a matter of great concern.
Parliamentary system becomes strong only when its major stakeholders agree to stay within its boundaries regardless of whether they are in power or out of power, and when they remain devoted to protecting the essence of the system. Those who are the first to violate the Constitution and break the system at the slightest opportunity are the biggest threat to parliamentary system and this Constitution. Unfortunately, Congress has also joined their ranks today.
Nepali Congress is constantly becoming weaker, both morally and in terms of public support, during the period with the ever power-hungry Deuba as its president.
In the 2017 general election Nepali Congress became the second-largest party in terms of popular votes for the first time in Nepal’s political history. President Deuba defended himself saying UML finished ahead of them on popular votes because of the left alliance even though the popular votes of Nepali Congress had increased.
There was no left alliance in this year’s election. UML had split. CPN (Unified Socialist), which had splintered from UML, received nearly 300,000 votes. But UML still became the largest party in terms of popular votes, finishing ahead of Congress by more than 150,000 votes.
NC has been losing the grounds to form a government on its own in recent times due to gradual erosion of its political base. The grand old party looks doomed to losing even the status of main opposition party looking at the people's revulsion toward the NC leadership and its recent misdeeds.
The lawmakers in the party who have yet to lose conscience must, therefore, seriously review the role of NC. They should play the role of a strong opposition in the House relinquishing the rat race for power in the current difficult situation for the parliamentary system if they have even an iota of historical responsibilities of the party. Play that role for safeguarding the people's rights and their interests, at least conserve a party to pin the people's hopes on if they lose trust in the parties in power to ensure that they don't give up on the parliamentary system."
88,view,https://en.setopati.com/view/160058,"The people have already elected 165 House of Representatives (HoR) members directly while the process of electing another 110 members through the Proportional Representation (PR) electoral system is in the final stage. A total of 275 elected lawmakers will enter the HoR in a few weeks to formulate laws for the country through periodic election.
The main tenet of democracy is the people legislating for themselves exercising that sovereign right through their representatives.
The elected people's representatives form the government to work for the people and formulate laws to bind that government and the general public. Nobody is above those laws and there is rule of law in the country. The biggest importance and spirit of modern democracy is vested in that.
The gerontocratic leaders of old parties with longevity like that of the sun and the moon who cannot see anything but power and do not care about any norms and limits of democracy have been repeatedly attacking this spirit. This has happened once again.
But the issue is graver than those of yesterday because a new government is going to be formed after the previous mandate expired. New lawmakers have been elected as people's representatives. The government formed as per the previous mandate and already past expiry date has amended an important criminal law through an ordinance with utter disregard for them. The law of the land does not allow the government to withdraw cases of grave crimes sub judice in the court. The court has repeatedly cautioned the government through its orders and verdicts in that regard.
The place to discuss and debate about the matter if someone in special circumstances is hard done by the prevailing laws and court precedents, and to amend them is the House elected by the people. The ordinance brought by the government now, therefore, is not right in the crucible of time, people's mandate, Constitution, laws or political morality. The government should, therefore, take back this ordinance.
There are many dimensions to the issue of 'bringing this ordinance for justice to' Resham Chaudhary, who has been jailed for almost five years, and other political rebels.
First things first, this ordinance has not been brought to ensure justice for Chaudhary. The government could have taken the bill related to the issue to the previous HoR if it genuinely felt that Chaudhary suffered injustice. This government has been in power for around one and a half years and had a clear majority in the previous House. The current ordinance has come as a bargaining tool for power. It has been brought to solicit Chaudhary's support in mustering a majority for the ruling coalition in the newly elected House. This quid pro quo will further complicate the issue of 'injustice' to Chaudhary, and will condemn him to further injustice.
Chaudhary is facing a court case as one of the main accused of the Tikapur incident in which eight police personnel including an SSP of Nepal Police and a toddler were lynched on August 24, 2015. He has been claiming that he was outside Tikapur on that day and he did not have anything to do with the attack on the police.
The then government had formed a judicial commission under former Supreme Court (SC) justice Girish Chandra Lal to find facts about the incident after thorough investigation. And that commission submitted its report almost five years back. The government has changed many times in the intervening period but the government has yet to make that report public.
Chaudhary's supporters claim that the report does not implicate Chaudhary in the Tikapur incident as the court case filed by the government contends, and many feel that he has been unjustly implicated and jailed. The government has supported these claims by not making the report public.
A large chunk of the Tharu community genuinely feels that Chaudhary is suffering injustice due to the shady character of the major political parties that say one thing when they are in power and quite another while in the opposition. This grievance of the Tharu community has manifested in this election. Nagarik Unmukti Party, registered under the leadership of Chaudhary's wife Ranjeeta Shrestha, has won three HoR seats under the First-Past-The-Post (FPTP) electoral system while the party's Lalbir Chaudhary has been elected as an independent candidate from Bardiya-2 after filing rebel candidacy. The party has won 12 seats in the provincial assembly and has secured almost 300,000 votes in the PR electoral system for HoR. This shows the sympathy of the Tharu community toward Resham Chaudhary and the degree of their displeasure toward the case filed against him.
The newly elected House cannot ignore the issue. It is the responsibility of the new House to study the Lal report, explore the additional aspects of the Tikapur incident, and prepare legal grounds and way toward justice for him if it concludes that he indeed has suffered injustice.
The new House can grant justice to Chaudhary in the true sense only by amending the law completing due procedures if he has suffered injustice, and acquit him of the allegations slapped against him. He will be deemed offender by a large chunk of the people if he is released through the ordinance as part of the quid pro quo for the government. That will be a bigger injustice to him. We, therefore, also urge him to not stress on the horse trading for government.
As far as the leaders of the ruling parties are concerned, they have been found repeatedly wanting on the issue of democratic processes and rule of law. Every leader of big parties has made a mockery of rule of law and abused the laws for vested interests while in the government. Ordinance, which is brought at the time of emergency or absence of House for essential works that must be done, has been turned into a tool of rulers for their vested interests.
There are rising aspirations of the people, especially the younger generation, that there is exercise of advanced democracy, rule of law, and democracy does not turn into an armor to cover up the caprices of those in power. The new generation has delivered that very message by establishing new parties in the recent HoR election.
The archaic leaders of the old parties have been repeatedly proving how alienated they are from these aspirations by bringing such ordinances. They will perhaps continue that until they are displaced."
89,view,https://en.setopati.com/view/159842,"The Election Commission has asked Setopati through an email to remove a news report published on Friday within 24 hours. We had published a news titled ‘Agni Kharel’s son Nishan in US Army, also continues to hold Nepali citizenship’ on Friday. The Election Commission on Saturday has asked for removal of the news report within 24 hours and sought explanation stating ‘There was character assassination of an individual who is candidate in the election and his family, and the news report has been published in a way that there is personal allegation’.
The letter issued by the Election Commission has yet to arrive in Setopati. We will decide whether to directly move the court to seek legal remedy or furnish explanation to the Election Commission once we receive the letter. We firmly believe that the Election Commission has instructed for removal of the news violating the limits and decorum of a constitutional commission on an issue it is not concerned with.
We have four major disagreements over the instruction by the Election Commission to remove the news and explanation it has sought.
First, the Election Commission has sought explanation on one hand while it has instructed to remove the news without waiting for that explanation on the other. This behavior of the Election Commission is ill-intentioned and unfortunate in itself.
The second is about its allegation that there was character assassination of an individual who is candidate in the election and his family, and the news report has been published in a way that there is personal allegation.
The news report published in Setopati mentions that Agni Kharel’s son Nishan Kharel serves in the US Army, and he still holds Nepali citizenship certificate and is included in the voter list. Both of those are facts. The Election Commission itself can check with its voter list. Our news report mentions that Agni Kharel himself has told Seopati that his son Nishan has been serving in the US Army for seven years.
We want to ask the Election Commission—how does this news report slander Agni Kharel who is candidate in the election, and his family? How is it an allegation?
The Election Commission instead has publicly slandered us by making such false allegations against Setopati. We challenge the Election Commission to prove this allegation, and request it to withdraw the same if it can’t.
We are clear that Nishan Kharel or any other Nepali reserves the rights to serve in the US or British or Indian army, or army or other security force of other countries, and it is a matter of individual choice for the person concerned.
Setopati stands for personal freedom of any individual. We don’t believe that moral questions can ever be asked of anyone on the basis of whether the person stays in Nepal or abroad, or serves in the Nepal Army or army of another country. People take decisions on the basis of their convenience and wish in different situations, and act accordingly. It is their individual and sovereign right if the decisions they take or their action do not harm others and do not violate the laws. We always respect those rights, and will always strive to protect those rights.
We also believe that the fact that a family member of a big leader or those who hold a major public position serves in a foreign army is a matter of interest for commoners, and hence a subject of news. We have, therefore, published the news of Nishan Kharel.
Those serving in the US Army should at least have permission for permanent residency in America. The person can easily acquire US citizenship after serving in the US Army. Nishan, who has been serving for seven years, should relinquish Nepali citizenship if he has acquired US citizenship. Not doing so would be against the laws of Nepal. We had asked Nishan’s father Agni whether Nishan has acquired US citizenship or not as he still holds Nepali citizenship. He could not say about Nishan’s US citizenship with certainty. We have also included Agni’s response in the news report. It is unfortunate that a constitutional body like the Election Commission has made allegations against a news story that we have reported complying with the decorum of journalism and completing due processes.
Third, this news is not related to the upcoming elections. It, therefore, does not attract the election code of conduct, nor can the Election Commission instruct for removal of the news citing the code of conduct. The Election Commission is not the authorized body to seek explanation about the news published by any media house or instruct for its removal.
Fourth, this is not the first time the Election Commission has sought clarification from Setopati in the name of election code of conduct. During the last local elections held in May, too, the Election Commission had sought clarification from us and instructed us to remove an election-related news. We had sent our clarification to the Election Commission refusing to remove the news.
That time the Election Commission had accused Setopati of violating the code of conduct by publishing election analyses based on conversations with voters of different local bodies. We were clear then and we are clear today as well that a voter has the right to privacy regarding who they want to vote for in an election. They need not reveal why they would or would not vote for somebody.
Also, voters also have the right to freedom of expression to publicly state why they would or would not vote for a candidate. Not only that, citizens also have the right to be politically organized, solicit votes for a political party and organize rallies.
Similarly, if any citizen tells a journalist without hesitation why she would or would not vote for somebody, what politician she likes or doesn’t like, whom she wants to help get elected or defeated, then a media house has the right to publish it. The Constitution itself has guaranteed that right and also defined its limits.
If it deems it necessary to ban the press from writing on something not prohibited by the Constitution and justifies that, then the legislature should formulate a law for it. The Election Commission cannot prepare a code of conduct that prohibits writing on issues not prohibited by the Constitution and the laws. The Election Commission’s code of conduct is not a law. We have already stated this in our earlier written clarification to the Election Commission.
Therefore, we urge the Election Commission to not discourage the press time and again, in the name of code of conduct, from reporting citizens’ views on political parties and leaders. We would also like to remind the Election Commission that such an act goes against the constitutional rights of citizens and the press."
90,view,https://en.setopati.com/view/159795,"On October 22 and 23, the Nepal Army (NA) organized a crucially important program to reflect on Nepal’s contribution to UN peace operations (PO). One of the several activities of the celebration was a seminar titled “Emerging capability requirements for UN Peace Operations and way forward” on October 23 at the NA headquarters where UN Under Secretary General for Peace Operations Jean-Pierre Lacroix virtually addressed the gathering. Chief Secretary of the Government of Nepal, NA Chief, and Military Advisor of the Secretary General of the UN and Nepal delegation head General Birame Diop were the other key persons to address the august gathering.
There were four presentations (3 from UN and 1 from NA) where I was also invited to make comments on presentations of two UN officials—“Developing and deploying capability needs for protection mandates” by Oliver Ulich (Deputy Representative UNHQ) and “Recommendations for TCCs like Nepal for generating and deploying suitable capabilities in UN Peace Operations” by Major General Hugh Van Roosen (retired).
The NA deserves special appreciation for organizing this very timely and highly relevant seminar and reflecting on our contribution to global peace, security and stability. It is equally important to critically look at what Nepal gained from this engagement and whether it is equitable compared to its contribution. Are we able to exhaust the potential for positioning Nepal as a champion of peacekeeping at the global level? What do we have to do to maximize our leverage and potential in this context and what should the UN think regarding the existing provisions of Troop and Police Contributing Countries (TPCC) in general and Nepal in particular?
Being a Nepali, I am very proud of the great contribution of our peacekeepers to maintaining international peace and security, one of the very foundational reasons of establishment of the UN in 1945, immediately after the Second World War by 51 countries.
That a Nepali peacekeepr accompanied the then UN Secretary General Kofi Annan to receive the Nobel Peace Prize for the UN in 2001 is evidence of the importance of Nepali peacekeepers in the UN and the contribution of Nepal to the UN peace mission.
Nepal has gained unique experiences by engaging in achieving stability and peace in highly unstable countries like Lebanon, Iraq, Mali, South Sudan, DRC, Yemen, Libya, the Central African Republic, Syria, Israel, Western Sahara, South Sudan and many others, thereby providing us with a powerful negotiation tool with the UN for expanded engagement in the future.
According to a recently (on the seminar) unveiled coffee-table book about Nepal’s contribution to the UN by the NA, more than 140,000 Nepali troops have engaged in 43 UN peacekeeping missions around the world so far. At present, about 5,623 Nepali men and women are serving in 12 peacekeeping missions in different parts of the world.
Further, Nepal is one of the only two TPCCs that have formed military units in all protection of civilian (POC) missions. This also shows the commitment of Nepal toward the global peace and stability mission of the UN.
So far, Peace Operation (PO) of the UN is largely guided by narrow, top-down headquarters, and the burden loaded on TPCCs (for example, capability needs for protection mandates to be arranged on their own), which needs to be changed to become more relevant. Nepal being the second largest contributor to UN peacekeeping, this is a direct concern. Capabilities for protection should not limit to training, units and equipment, and personnel which UN is advocating but also include commitment of international support. Only then can it be termed “Whole-of-Mission Approach” and it should always cover all four protection mandates (protection of civilians, child protection, conflict-related sexual violence, and human rights).
Even though the three tiers of POC concepts—dialogue and engagement; physical protection; and establishment of protective environment—are pragmatic, it is essential to add security governance and civil military relations in the third component ‘establishment of protective environment’, to enhance trust, ownership and gain local support.
One of the weak concepts used in the UN military component about responsibilities at the strategic level is ‘Do No Harm’, which is a contextual operational concept developed by Mary Anderson in 1999 in the conflict-affected development context. The UN PO must strategically expand it to “Do Good” as the POC mandate itself is for doing good. Though the Action for Peace+ of the SG emphasizes on “Systemwise Digital Transformation Strategy” as a capacity tool for protection mandate, incorporating early warning and forecasting digital system deserves further consideration.
Based on the experiences of more than six decades of engagement of the NA in UN peace missions, it is the right time to holistically review and address the concerns raised in this paper.
The Government of Nepal must expand its engagement with the UN for maintaining international peace and security, developing friendly relations among nations and promoting social progress, better living standards and human rights, a very foundational aim of creation of the UN. It will be a win-win result for both Nepal and the UN. The following are some of the possible ways forward.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) must focus on expanding its sphere of influence for which we have three major potential areas.

First, Nepal has a great scope of positioning itself as a champion of global climate change debate because glacier melts and related crisis in the Hindukush Himalayas are global concerns. Hence, Nepal must globally and proactively engage on the issues of climate change and related insecurities.
Second, we have Lumbini, the birthplace of Lord Buddha. Nepal’s meaningful and strategic proactive engagement with Buddhist countries will provide a large number of tourists to Lumbini to noticeably enhance our economy.  These two issues are not direct concerns of this paper and I am not going to discuss it further.
The third and the most important one is expanding Nepal’s engagement in UNPO by a) increasing total number of troops aiming to be the top TPCC, b) providing a higher number of female peacekeepers, c) ensuring more officers in senior positions (eg force commanders) and d) sending civilian experts (eg on rule of law, justice, human rights, women empowerment, ceasefire monitoring, post conflict reconstruction, etc).
Achieving these points will not be easy. The MoFA must send capable UN representatives with a higher profile, better negotiation skills, full commitment and a desire to work hard to achieve them. It may require continuous, proactive and meaningful dialogue and negotiation with the UN Secretary General, Security Council and its members, members of General Assembly, and UN representatives of other countries.

Similarly, the Ministry of Defense must work hard to create a favorable domestic environment for achieving the points listed above. The NA has already offered to send 10,000 troops and must be ready and it must be realized as soon as practically feasible. By expanding our peacekeepers, Nepal will gain more experiences and expand the zone of influence in international peace and stability.
The Ministry of Finance must ensure financial provisions for armored personnel carriers (APCs) and other logistics on par with the standard of other TPCCs.
The NA must make sure that the police and soldiers deployed in French and Spanish-speaking countries get language training before their deployment.
The UN in general and UNSG and Department of Peace Operations in particular should categorize member countries into groups regarding the PO:
Troops and Police Contributing Countries (TPCCs) (who are providing a large number of troops),
Capability Contributing Countries (CCC) who are not providing a significant number of troops. They have to be responsible for capabilities and logistics (like airlifting planes, armored vehicles, training, information and technology, and so on).
Regarding the contribution of peacekeepers from Nepal, there is no representation of senior officials proportional to the troops (there are only 6 Force Commanders so far). Therefore, the UN must seriously rethink it and make sure that recruitment of senior officers is commensurate with peacekeepers (also necessary for equity). Nepal has proved and gained international repute as a country committed to upholding the principles outlined in the UN Charter and the UN must, therefore, consider this concern.

In conclusion, the UN as well as the member states, especially resourceful countries who have the responsibility to maintain international peace and stability as per the UN Charter, have to rethink PO in the changing global context and ensure fairness to TPCCs, recognize the contribution of certain countries like Nepal in fulfilling objectives of the UN to keep international peace and stability. Hence, Nepal must provide space to increase peacekeepers, senior officials and civilian officials."
91,view,https://en.setopati.com/view/159658,"Every post has its decorum and dignity. The post of president as a head of state also has its own decorum and dignity. The dignity of that post is related to the duties defined by the Constitution.
“Compliance and protection of the Constitution shall be the main duties of the President,” Article 61(4) of the Constitution states.
The oath of office and secrecy administered to the president also mentions, “Remaining completely faithful to the Constitution of Nepal…under prevailing laws…will perform with sincerity.”
President Bidya Devi Bhandari has failed in the main duty prescribed by the Constitution, and destroyed the decorum and dignity of the post of president.
There is a constitutional provision allowing the president to send back any bill submitted for authentication by the sovereign parliament for reconsideration. But the president must authenticate the bill within 15 days if the House again sends it to the president. She did not have any alternative to that and authenticating the Citizenship Bill was her constitutional duty.
Some legal professionals have argued that the Citizenship Bill has also automatically become inactive once the term of the House of Representatives (HoR) expired, and the president need not authenticate it. But that is not true.
“If the session ends when a Bill is still under consideration, the next session may take over the procedure.
Provided that, if a Bill is presented to the House of Representatives and is under consideration, or it is sent to National Assembly after passing it, but if the House of Representatives is dissolved while the Bill is still under consideration in the National Assembly, or if its tenure comes to an end, such Bill shall be considered not effective,” states Article 111(10) of the Constitution.
The Citizenship Bill was not under consideration in any House, and was submitted to the president after being endorsed by both the HoR and the National Assembly. The Constitution and laws do not envision any bill passed by both the HoR and the National Assembly becoming inactive. The Constitution, similarly, also does not envision the president not authenticating the bill sent to the president for the second time.
The president’s step, therefore, has raised serious questions about the Constitution and system. Can an individual who does not obey the Constitution continue as president or not? If we assume she can, then it will create a wrong precedent for those becoming president in the coming days. What will happen if a future president also defies any decision taken by the government or the parliament?
We will then be forced to wait anxiously whether the president will authenticate any bill sent after being passed by the House, whether the president will endorse the decision taken by the Cabinet or not. We will, in other words, reach a situation where the president, and not the parliament or the Cabinet with majority in that parliament, will exercise the sovereign powers of the people. That will vitiate our system in an irrevocable manner. That will afflict every prime minister that comes after election in the future and the parliamentary system. Every party that can get into the government will be eventually afflicted.
There is, therefore, the need for rule-based and long-term treatment of the arbitrariness displayed by the president now. One may say “The president did not honor the Constitution, we will also not honor the president.” Or even inform that the bill automatically comes into effect by publishing it in the Nepal Gazette. But that would be a response in rage. Anger does not make the Constitution and system stronger.
It is necessary to once again move the court to protect the Constitution and system, and to make them stronger, to take the president who has deviated from her responsibilities and constitutional duties to the dock of the court.
The court has already corrected President Bhandari for not fulfilling her constitutional duties appropriately. She had refused to appoint Sher Bahadur Deuba as the prime minister in accordance to Article 76(5) of the Constitution after 149 HoR members wrote to her to that regard defying the rights of the HoR to elect PM. The Supreme Court after a long hearing issued a mandamus instructing her to appoint Deuba as PM and administer oath of office and secrecy within 24 hours.
The SC, definitely, would look at this issue if anyone moves the court demanding that the president be asked to fulfill her constitutional duties. The court has already interpreted clearly that judicial remedy can be sought for presidential acts saying that the provision prohibiting filing of court cases against the president for works done in capacity of the president is limited only up to prohibiting making the president personally liable. But there remains no such limits about examination of the legal validity of the questions raised about use and implementation of the constitutional rights and provisions by the president.
That court verdict adds that no state official remains above the law or beyond the purview of law in a constitutional system incorporating democratic norms and values, and in rule of law. It reminds that keeping all presidential decisions beyond the purview of legal examination would ultimately lead to arbitrariness and autocracy.  
This precedent clearly shows that the court can look at the dereliction of the constitutional duty by the president in not authenticating the Citizenship Bill.
It is necessary to take this issue to the court and conclude it there to show constitutional limits to the president who displayed arbitrariness by not authenticating the bill submitted to her after being passed by the parliament, and also to remind her successors about those limits."
92,view,https://en.setopati.com/view/159648,"The Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) has been sending police and staffers with excavators in tow in the Hattisar area, where Tukucha has been put through an underground tunnel, for the past few days. They have been digging the ground in private houses of individuals and companies, demolishing walls, and threatening and instructing the owners to remove the structures. Owners of the houses and the land have been saying they have not encroached the land, rather procured it by completing legal procedures, built houses in accordance to the designs passed by the KMC and acquired documents of completing construction. With documents and evidence in hand, they have been pleading with the KMC to have a look at those documents. But the police and KMC staffers deployed on the field with excavators have not listened to their pleadings. They have been evading the owners saying, “Don’t tell us, ask engineers, and those above us.” And threatening that the houses will be demolished if found above the tunnel through which Tukucha is flowing.
A team of police and staffers reached the residence of 82-year-old Sharada Manandhar at Hattisar with excavators on Monday, shut the compound gate that was open, and then brought the gate down with the excavator. She had rented a small truss-structure inside the compound to a coffee house for the past four years. That was an additional source of income on top of her government pension. The KMC ordered her to demolish the structure stating that it is above Tukucha and warned that they will run the excavator if it is not demolished. The tenant has vacated the coffee house after KMC’s threats.
The police and KMC staffers are not to blame for all this, and its main leadership—Mayor Balen Shah—is the one responsible. He doesn’t want to check the facts of Hattisar, nor is he ready to listen to the locals. Yogesh Mishra, a local, met Shah at his office armed with documents and evidence, and tried to brief him about the facts but Shah was uninterested in his efforts, Mishra claims.
The KMC has started to display the brutality of excavators instead of looking at the facts and evidence presented by the locals, and presenting its own evidence to show that the locals have encroached the land.
What is this attitude showed by the KMC leadership, its police and staffers? It is necessary to call and define this mentality for what it is. This is blatant thuggery. The state’s thuggery over the law-abiding citizens is an unpardonable crime in democracy. And this crime needs to stop immediately.
The facts that we have unearthed, our conversation with locals of Hattisar, and the documents and evidence they have clearly show that they have not encroached the land. This is ancestral property of some; others had legally procured the land only some time back and built houses there. The land there has been sold and procured at government offices for years. Those who have built houses and other structures have done so after passing the design through the KMC and taking permission from other bodies concerned.
The land in Hattisar was never under government ownership. The land was owned by local farmers when the then Rana prime minister Bir Shumsher decided to put the Tukucha flowing out from the southern wall of the Narayanhiti Palace inside a tunnel 130 years ago. Historical documents have proved that the Ranas had acquired the land at Rs 200 per ropani. They constructed the underground tunnel for Tukucha and built a spacious ground by filling the tunnel but they never brought that land under the state’s ownership. That land was eventually distributed among Bir Shumsher’s children. Some of the plots there are still owned by Bir Shumsher’s descendants. Others have been transferred to the current owners after legal transactions.
The most important thing is, the land was surveyed in 1975. The map prepared then does not mention Tukucha. Not many may have remembered the Tukucha that was sent underground more than 80 years earlier. The state may also not have deemed it necessary to keep Tukucha in the map.
To say that the owners should have known about the Tukucha that was never mentioned in government map, and accuse them of encroaching the land over Tukucha and building houses is sheer insanity. The KMC has been doing precisely that now. To try to remove the locals from there through threats and excavator terror without completing any legal process and provision of compensation is an unthinkable act by the state. The Constitution has granted inviolable rights to property for the citizens. The excavators sent by Balen Shah cannot violate that, nor can the state take an ax to the private property of citizens without paying appropriate compensation.
The land and houses are not just physical properties for the people. They are connected with the person’s and her family’s love, sweat and many memories, and self-respect. The place is beloved for every individual with special importance and prestige. Where does the KMC get the rights to deploy excavators on such places without their permission when they have not committed any offense? Which morality granted that? Those hurting the self-respect of citizens by deploying excavators are liable for punishment in rule of law. Our law also deems attack on others’ properties a punishable offense.
There seems to be a frightening tendency now. A few individuals seem to be happy when the state has attacked others' properties. It is the nature of the crowd to take sadistic pleasure at the sufferings of others. That is understandable. But another dangerous tendency can also be seen in the Nepali society now—not speaking and writing against wrong deeds of Balen Shah due to his popularity. The victims of Hattisar have met Kathmandu lawmakers and leaders of parties and briefed their grievances. But the leaders have expressed helplessness saying, “We cannot speak against Balen Shah at such times.”
Expressing their helplessness, the victims say, “Politicians don’t listen to us, the media doesn’t write about us. What justice would the court provide during such a time?”
Some state bodies appear hesitant to fulfill their responsibilities. For example, it has come to light that the Tukucha tunnel was built 130 years ago by Bir Shumsher. Many say it was an amazing example of engineering for that period. The fact that the great earthquakes of 1934 and 2015 could not inflict any damage to the underground tunnel also clearly shows how strong the structure was built. Therefore, it is our heritage of historical and archeological importance that shows the engineering technology of the Rana period. According to law, no structure older than 100 years can be altered or demolished. It can only be altered under the supervision of the Department of Archaeology. The law has given that authority to the Department of Archeology. But the department seems reluctant to fulfill its responsibilities. It has remained silent even when the KMC’s excavators have been digging up such an old heritage every day. It has not even bothered to go and inspect the sites of excavation.
If society starts bowing down to populism like this, then democracy will start losing its essence. Therefore, it is necessary to speak and write about this injustice meted out by the KMC to the citizens so that those who are facing injustice do not lose their hope for justice. A democratic society is also a society that puts faith in justice in each other. Those who face the wrath of the state are left alone only in an autocratic society, where everyone fears the state.
Thankfully, there is also a good side to a populist wave—populism is usually short-lived. And people in a democratic society will challenge it sooner or later.
What now?
First of all, the thuggery needs to be stopped. The KMC needs to bring the excavator terror to an end and stop threatening the citizens.
And the KMC should discuss the issue with a cool mind in its executive meeting, and take decision in light of the facts that have come to the fore. It should consider whether the Tukucha tunnel has to be demolished or not? The settlement of Hattisar has to be displaced or not? The cost for doing so, the return on the expenses incurred, and whether that can be justified considering other glaring priorities of the KMC?
There will be debate in the media and the civil society on what to do about Tukucha, and whether to revive it or not. People will put their own positions on different aspects of the issue. That is inseparable and essential in a democratic society. That will bring many aspects of the disputed issue to the fore, and help the decision-makers take decision. But the sovereign rights to take a call rest on them in capacity of the elected people’s representatives. The Constitution has provisions specifying what the local government, the provincial government and the federal government can do. Everyone should fulfill one’s responsibility accordingly.
If the settlement has to be evacuated, the KMC must hold friendly dialogue with the locals about compensation. They should not be treated like enemies. Both the sides should agree and move forward accordingly. The Government of Nepal should take decision in accordance to the Land Acquisition Act if there is no such agreement, and pay compensation accordingly. And move the works forward.
No government has the authority to ignore the laws, processes and regulations, and unleash excavators on an individual’s property taking a mob, threaten the citizens and oppress them. That is not accepted in a civilized and democratic society."
93,view,https://en.setopati.com/view/159494,"Reporting of incidents of sexual assaults in Nepal has increased significantly in the last 10 years. More survivors are opening up as a result of social media's growth and the global #MeToo movement. Such violations have a wider impact than is generally thought. Cases of sexual abuse also have an underlying effect on mental health, in addition to the legal and socioeconomic repercussions. To comprehend how such events worsen survivors' mental health, sufficient research and studies have not been conducted.
A 24-year-old girl from Baglung in western Nepal was frequently raped by her father-in-law for a few years. Her husband was abroad for employment during that period. When this incident came out, her father-in-law accused her of infidelity and questioned her ""character"". Though authorities are investigating this matter, her mental health has deteriorated to the point that she has lost most of her senses.
Delay in filing cases for these crimes has deteriorated many survivors' mental health, according to journalist Nisha Oli. The majority of survivors take their time opening up. Their mental health is further hampered by this delay.
The road to rehabilitation is not easy, she continues. Most of the time, survivors are unaware of the necessity. Additionally, there are no agencies or groups that serve as mediators to ease the changeover. Although we are not professionals, I have observed various psychiatric issues among survivors. We can only help them along. The predicament is alarming.
While every instance of sexual abuse is unique, the effects it has on women and girls are often the same.
A 25-year-old traumatized survivor is now residing at a hostel in Kathmandu. The abuser has fled, and she is a long way from receiving justice. Her life has been turned upside down. Her life has changed since her mother passed away. Her father soon moved on after getting remarried. She is living alone now that her grandmother has passed away. For her, this was not the end.
She was assaulted at the home of a relative. Nobody believed her. Rather, she was blamed by many. At that point, everything for her was altered. She has been experiencing mental, physical, social, and psychological difficulties for the past nine years. She started to get suicidal tendencies. She spoke about the events in a very frank manner, unlike the majority of survivors.
Her attempts to get assistance were unsuccessful. However, neither the police nor the public gave her any credit. She contacted many groups, but none of them were able to assist. Organizations like the National Women’s Commission and Maiti Nepal responded in a lukewarm and disappointing manner. They also made fun of her for having mental health issues. They heightened the suffering. Numerous survivors have similar life experiences. Commission employees treat survivors like animals. They torture sufferers instead of offering consolation and compassion. There are numerous instances of survivors who have made it to Anuradha Koirala, the founder of Maiti Nepal, and then returned home sobbing. One of the survivors declared, ""All that glitters is not gold.”
Many of the responsible groups have utterly failed in this regard. These groups frequently throw temper tantrums, including berating, requesting that survivors contact the police or bring attorneys, and refusing to offer assistance. The persistent lack of empathy displayed by these institutions hurts the survivors. According to many analysts, social organizations and government entities are found wanting on this issue. Simply put, there is a lack of knowledge, urgency, and priority.
Journalist Nisha Oli claims that survivors have access to safe shelters. These safe houses offer lodging, help with processing abortions, and limited therapy. However, there are little long-term benefits from short-term counseling. According to Nisha, counseling should not only concentrate on giving support but also assist in the development of life skills. These skills bring financial independence and respect.
A Nepali girl claimed a few months ago on her Instagram and Tiktok pages that she had experienced several rapes and other forms of torture. She went on to say that the trauma caused by these sexual assaults had ruined her life and left her with despair, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
She revealed the abuser's identity and the circumstances she had to deal with after numerous instances of sexual assault in a video that was posted on TikTok and Instagram. There was widespread outrage over this across the nation. Massive rallies and demonstrations demanding justice for her were held in its wake. Her candor inspired many women and girls to talk about their traumatic experiences. The parliament heard debates over the statute of limitations for such crimes.The struggle against sexual assault has gained the much-needed spark.
The case, according to many experts, is just the beginning. The number of sexual assault cases that have been reported has sharply increased in recent years; 2144 and 2230 rape cases were reported in the fiscal years 2018–2019 and 2019–2020, respectively. There were 981 instances in the fiscal year 2014–2015, marking a 10-year high for the number. According to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey, 7% of women and girls (15–49) nationwide have reported experiencing sexual assault at some point in their lives. Even if the rates are rising, it is believed that they are actually even higher. Many women have been forced to keep such crimes to themselves due to the sensitive nature of crime.
Due to survivors' lack of knowledge about their legal rights and the lack of assistance they receive from friends and family, most of such incidents of sexual assault go unreported or remain secret. Instead of demanding retribution from the offender, many times survivors are questioned about their character instead. As a result, the judicial procedure rarely takes place and most of the time, offenders get away scot free.
The mental health support group Umanga Nepal carried out a poll on a small sample of women. Eighteen adolescent girls were surveyed, and the results showed that 15 of them experienced various forms of sexual abuse. Rape, attempted rape, sexual harassment, and sexual misbehavior were all covered. The majority of them experienced maltreatment as children, and they are still traumatized by it. In most cases, family members, friends, coworkers, boyfriends, and strangers were the culprits. Nine of the 18 females experienced abuse in their own homes when aged 10-14 years from family members and neighbors.
The majority of them struggle with anxiety, sleep problems, trauma, and challenges of trust. Their relationships and profession have both been harmed by this. Their confidence and aspirations have been destroyed by the trauma of such an event. Many of the victims have not yet sought legal representation or confronted their abusers. Social hierarchies and taboos are to blame to this. Fears of judgment, marginalization, and victimization are just a few among them. The majority of poll respondents experience guilt, shame, and panic. They are all guilty of self-blame. Survivors of sexual abuse are frequently at risk for mental health problems because of the trauma brought on by such occurrences and the self-deprecating emotions they elicit.
Sexual-abuse survivors are more prone to experiencing traumatic disorders and trust issues, according to psychotherapist Sita Lama from Mann Ka Kura, who has experience of working with trafficked girls and women. The majority of them are compelled to live with the trauma because they are reluctant to discuss freely about their mental health due to their family history, fear of criticism, and fear of being judged.
She concurs that it takes time for those who have experienced molestation during their formative years or at any other time to open up and find courage. Even if they do open up, they are uncomfortable conversing. In a few instances, people arrive looking for assistance for their ""friends."" But the majority of the time, it's their own tale.
“Even if they visit us, they are not at ease. Counselors must speak to clients in a way that encourages them to open up and begin believing in us. Some of them crumble and despise their own bodies,” she continues.
The slogan, according to Lama, is ""It's not our fault."" Acknowledging pain is the first step on the road to recovery. Dance therapy, behavior therapy, and art therapy can all aid with trauma reduction. However, recovery takes time. It won't happen overnight. Every instruction must be followed. It takes some time to find the wound and heal it.
When we respect and cherish our bodies, we can communicate with them mentally and emotionally. We are not to blame for anything that has happened to us in the past. In light of this, Lama considers loving and caring for the body to be one of the most crucial tasks.
Trauma is merely the beginning of the agony trail. Substance misuse is one of the main effects of such trauma. Most survivors take this route to get away from their experience. One of the survey's survivors related a similar experience. Drunken urges to temporarily flee are very likely. Many survivors still take drugs despite being aware of their negative effects. Unprescribed medications are more hazardous than helpful, as has been universally accepted and empirically demonstrated.
Sexual assault cases are not limited by gender or color. It has received a lot of discussion and condemnation. Studies and research of various kinds are being conducted. According to a study by Boston-based Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health professor Karestan Koenen, sexual assault and harassment ""often take a significant long-term toll on a victim's mental and physical health, increasing the risk for not only depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but also high blood pressure and sleep loss.""
""Not everyone who has been assaulted or harassed will endure persistent and lifelong repercussions. Being surrounded by a lot of supportive social networks can be beneficial for some people,"" she claimed. But a lot of folks aren't, Koenen continued. “Many women avoid discussing their experiences with others, often for years, out of concern that they won't be believed or that they would be referred to as ""nuts"" or ""sluts."" They, therefore, keep a secret from others, which wears them down over time and prevents them from receiving the assistance they require. Additionally, these encounters are extremely taxing on a bodily and psychological level.""
Sexual assault instances come in a variety of forms, according to Ram Pukar Shah, a clinical psychologist at Kanti Bal Hospital and CEO of the Subha Mangal Group. Some individuals discover the information after the fact.
""Our conversations are private. We start by getting a better grasp of the clients' behavior, interests, and character attributes. We don't rush because it's a delicate subject and it takes victims a long time to open up. We start by diagnosing the problems, whether they are anxiety, PTSD, or depression.
“Sometimes it's necessary to refer a patient to a psychiatrist and prescribe medicine as well, allowing therapy and medication to work in concert. We try several approaches based on the situation and the severity of the condition. There is therapy for trauma. We have to convince them that they are secure.
“Some survivors recover on their own with counseling, while others require behavioral therapy. Multiple abuse victims require extra time to recover. However, developing trust with your therapist or counselor is a crucial step.
“However, psychological counseling and therapy are still in their infancy in a nation like Nepal. The industry has come under fire for lacking professionalism and accessibility. Whoever is sincere and nonjudgmental is a true professional,” Shah continues.

94,view,https://en.setopati.com/view/159210,"Dipendra Kunwar has been promoted to Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) of the Armed Police Force (APF) in a way that he is ranked top from his batch.
He has not topped his batch due to his capabilities. He is not only incapable compared to others from his batch but was not even eligible to be recommended for promotion now. But he has been recommended as the highest ranked among his batch mates after pulling strings due to his relation with the political leadership at Baluwatar.
Kunwar is the husband of Bhanu Deuba’s sister. Bhanu Deuba is the nephew and personal secretary of Prime Minister (PM) Sher Bahadur Deuba. Kunwar, who has been recommended for promotion to SSP, in this way is the son-in-law of PM Deuba.
He has been pushed forward in a fraudulent manner in a way that he becomes APF chief in the future because he is a relative of the Deuba family.
The promotion committee under the Home Ministry chaired by the Home Secretary decided to recommend 14 Superintendents of Police (SP) to SSP on Friday. Kunwar has been ranked second overall behind Praveen Kandel, who joined the APF from the Nepal Police and is set to retire soon, and top among his batch mates.
The APF regulation, which required APF personnel to serve for at least four years in a position to become eligible for promotion in the APF, was amended for Kunwar’s promotion. Kunwar would complete four years as Superintendent of Police (SP) only in April 2023. So, the government amended the regulation on July 6 and changed the eligibility to three years.
Kunwar had joined the APF as inspector on March 21, 2003. He was ranked toward the bottom of the 74 inspectors of his batch. But he was ranked 10th from among his batch mates when he was promoted to SP from Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), and has now been made top-ranked among his batch mates.
Bishnu Prasad Bhatta, who was the top-ranked inspector among the 74 from Kunwar’s batch, has now been ranked behind Kunwar while being promoted to SSP.
The main objective for promoting him now as the top-ranked among his batch mates is to make him Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of Police first and then Inspector General of Police (IGP).
There are currently three vacancies for DIG in the APF. There is no experience eligibility for DIG as in junior positions and Kunwar will directly become a candidate for DIG as Kandel, who is top-ranked among the newly promoted SSPs, would retire before becoming DIG due to age limit. Kunwar, who is ranked behind Kandel, would be an obvious claimant to IGP.
One must pass staff college to become DIG of the APF. Kunwar has twice failed entrance examinations for staff college. But the APF leadership took a special decision to send him to the staff college of Nepal Army (NA) at Shivapuri for the course even though only the best few APF officers are sent to the Nepal Army staff college. It is, in this way, clearly apparent that he completed staff college due to political backing.
SP Kunwar’s promotion is directly connected to PM Deuba. The PM or his secretariat is at the center of how he has been illegitimately recommended for promotion, that too in a way that he is ranked top among his batch mates.
It is now PM Deuba’s responsibility to either prove that the facts that have been uncovered about Kunwar now are false or revoke his unlawful recommendation. Deuba is guardian of all those serving the nation through NA, Nepal Police, APF and civil service in his capacity as the executive head of the country. The government led by him cannot mete out injustice to anyone.
Deuba’s responsibility as a PM elected by the people is toward the country and not his family. Democracy is a system of government of the people but all the citizens cannot go to the Singha Durbar and govern as that is not practically possible. The citizens, therefore, should govern through their representatives. The government or the leadership of government, in this manner, is the representative of citizens governing in their stead.
It is the responsibility of those in the leadership to use that for the larger good of the citizens. It is arbitrary to shirk one’s responsibility and take any decision for the benefit of oneself or those close to oneself. Arbitrariness of the leadership is unacceptable and unpardonable in democracy.
There is also another side to this.
It is a legitimate expectation of every police officer to be top-ranked if she has performed well, has displayed integrity in behavior, excelled in work, and is more qualified than other contenders.
“The issue of promotion to IGP is not just an issue of the government’s pleasure but is also an issue of the rights and legitimate expectation of the candidates concerned,” reads a Supreme Court verdict curtailing the arbitrariness of the government in IGP appointment.
PM Deuba cannot trample on the legitimate expectations of any qualified police officer to promote his relative even now. Display of such arbitrariness by those in the government can harm the police organization in the long run.  
If there is no environment where a new officer who has recently joined the police force can expect to become the IGP in the future because she believes she is the best police officer based on her conduct and capabilities, then why would anyone strive to become a good police officer? She will then try to curry favor with politicians and arrange money to offer to higher-ups. What will happen to the security of the country and the citizens then? Discrimination against public servants by every political party and leadership when in power will kill their dreams. That will, in turn, give rise to despair and increase malpractices in police and administration.
It does not suit somebody like PM Deuba, who has even endured life in prison during such a long political career, to promote his relative causing injustice to others. More than that, this is blatantly immoral.
We urge PM Deuba to immediately intervene and revoke the unlawful recommendation for promotion of his relative, protect the rights of other police officers, give them justice and save himself from yet another stain on his name."
95,view,https://en.setopati.com/view/159047,"The issue of grave controversy that Finance Minister Janardan Sharma has been mired is no longer limited to the Finance Ministry. The main responsibility for accountability definitely is Minister Sharma’s. But the buck stops with Prime Minister (PM) Sher Bahadur Deuba as chairman of the Cabinet and Chairman of Sharma’s party Pushpa Kamal Dahal now that Sharma has run away from accountability.
It is now PM Deuba’s responsibility to either prove that Finance Minister Sharma has not committed any offense or to immediately fire him and conduct an investigation. It is CPN (Maoist Center) Chairman Dahal’s responsibility to take initiative for that or at least support it as Sharma is minister from his party.
We don’t know whether the grave allegations against Sharma that unauthorized persons entered the Finance Ministry premises in the midnight and corrected the tax rates in the budget to serve vested interests are true or not.
But after the closed-circuit television (CCTV) footage episode we firmly believe that the issue should not be resolved without judicial or parliamentary investigation. Sharma can return to the ministry if he is proved innocent but he should be liable for legal and political punishment if his involvement in this grave crime is established.
The issue for investigation is simple and clear. Had any unauthorized person entered the Finance Ministry in the midnight a day before the budget was presented in the federal parliament or not?
Minister Sharma has publicly claimed that no unauthorized persons entered the Finance Ministry at the time of finalizing the budget. We can give him benefit of doubt, if it can be given at all, only until the investigation on CCTV footage is completed. The investigation will find him innocent or guilty.  
The irresponsible response that the Finance Ministry has given stating that the CCTV footage can be retained only for 13 days in the right to information (RTI) request filed by a citizen seeking footage of the ministry at the alleged time of crime has made this issue graver.
There are two sides of the CCTV footage episode. The first is the right of citizens for access to and surveillance of the works done by the state. The second is the responsibility of the Finance Ministry to keep the CCTV footage safe for at least three months.  
Nepal has formulated law related to RTI. The spirit of that law is clear—the citizens have the right for surveillance of any work done by the state, any state organ or any official in that organ in a democratic country. They can seek information related to that in writing.
The right of such surveillance of the politicians elected by the people and who are remunerated by the taxes paid by them is fundamental in a democratic system. It is the duty of every politician to be sensitive toward the right granted to the citizens by the law and comply with it. They cannot shirk from their responsibility.
The RTI has been granted considering that politicians or any authorized person can take decision in a dark room against public interest for self-interest of them or others to ensure that they can make such decisions public and resist against those decisions.
The citizens have been fulfilling their responsibilities toward democracy by electing politicians through their votes even in the most adverse conditions on the one hand. They have also been bearing the financial burden of keeping the state functioning by paying taxes despite the financial difficulties they face on the other.  
It is, therefore, necessary to imbibe that the rights of citizens for surveillance of the state and politicians is inviolable.  
How important the issue of a citizen seeking CCTV footage of the Finance Ministry automatically becomes clear once one accepts this basic tenet. It is legal and moral responsibility of the Finance Ministry leadership to provide the footage sought completing legal procedures.  The ministry has shirked from this responsibility by giving a written response that the ministry’s CCTV footage can be retained only for 13 days.  
The Home Ministry’s guidelines about installation and operation of CCTV requires footage of CCTV cameras be kept safe for at least three months and adds that the district administration office concerned can investigate about the CCTV footage. The footage of May 28, therefore, should be kept safe at least until August 28.
The gravity of allegations against Minister Sharma has increased further after the ministry’s response that it does not have the footage of the final night before the budget was presented in the House. He should not be exonerated of this episode without investigation which should start by immediately removing him as minister.
Technological experts can retrieve the footage even if it has been lost. The wrong intentions would be automatically proved if the footage has been deleted in an irretrievable manner.
PM Deuba and Maoist Center Chairman Dahal do not have the luxury of ignoring this episode. Their support for Sharma, if not implication, will be clearly established if they do so."
96,view,https://en.setopati.com/view/159000,"During the monsoon season, almost every day, we wake up to some hazardous events such as landslides and floods and their devastating impact on people and society. Over the last decade Nepal experienced a number of major floods, landslides, windstorms, lightnings, public health-related and other monsoon hazards that caused loss of lives and livelihoods. This explains the diversity of hazards that Nepal faces and underscores the importance of more predictable and accountable disaster management.
2022 monsoon outlook and preparedness
The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority (NDRRMA) estimates around two million people can be potentially affected by the monsoon hazards in 2022. Based on this caseload all three levels of government—federal, provincial, and local—together with humanitarian partners including the private sector have been engaged in preparedness and readiness activities to effectively respond to the potential monsoon disasters.
However, there are questions about effective implementation of such plans and policies. For example, when there is a disaster, provisions on such plans are overlooked. All the disaster management committees at local, district, provincial and federal levels convene and take some generic decisions. Often there is redundancy in the decisions and no follow-up. Coordination with other relief providers such as volunteer groups, private sector and civil society is ad-hoc. In the name of one-door policy, relief activities are held up. Often relief workers find it difficult to navigate the complexities and reach to the population in need of support.
“Funds and materials get allocated. There is never a serious shortfall, but the governance mechanism which is needed most during the time of crisis becomes more confusing. Whenever there is a disaster situation everybody in the bureaucracy and the political system, from ward member to the prime minister, gets engaged,” says Krishna Lamichhane, a Red Cross worker in Nawalparasi of Lumbini province. “They try to politically capitalize on the humanitarian situation and make a trip to the affected site. But real relief work takes a hit.” Lamichhane believes empowering front-line Red Cross network would improve delivery.
Front-line governance
An accountable and predictable approach is required to timely protect lives and livelihoods from hazards and ensure effective disaster response. The Constitution of Nepal has entrusted the local bodies with an exclusive jurisdiction and responsibilities in disaster management. The local officials including elected ward officials, police, health workers and Red Cross are the first responders and manage the relief efforts in the critical early hours of response.
Given their detailed knowledge of the community, the local bodies are best able to identify hazards, assess vulnerabilities and design appropriate policies to reduce and manage risks. Local officials are well positioned to spearhead disaster preparedness planning. Moreover, many practical local measures can be implemented at the local level to ensure disasters are managed locally as much as possible and nationalized only when it is necessary.
Although local bodies bear primary functional responsibility for disaster management, local capacity particularly in disaster response is weak. The local bodies lack own search and rescue workers and technical expertise. The district authorities, which are federal government entities, maintain the capability in search and rescue, and support the local bodies. Post-disaster analyses essentially reveal that local disaster management capacities are weak and underfunded.
In addition to the technical capabilities, local decision-making process has to be effective and efficient. “The governance mechanism has to be facilitating and coordinating in responding to disasters or other problems in the society,” says Deputy Mayor of Rajapur Municipality in Bardiya Mankala Kumari Chaudhary. She emphasizes that necessary guidelines, protocols and standards have to be developed and updated by the government. To have predictability in governance, there must be accountability of the elected officials and the institutions and partnership with wide range of actors in the society.
Transforming traditional governance to anticipatory approaches
Given the unpredictability in hazards, the country needs to move away from the traditional form of reactive approach to more anticipatory approaches. The anticipatory approaches are the ability to harness the collective intelligence and wisdom of collaborating with organizations and citizens. According to Leon Fuerth (2009), anticipatory governance is “a system of institutions, rules and norms that provide a way to use foresight for the purpose of reducing risk and to increase capacity to respond to events at early rather than later states of their development.”
Better disaster preparedness and anticipatory governance could be achieved by emphasizing readiness for all types of hazards and involving multiple dimensions including mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery.
Nepal has started practicing anticipatory governance approach in disaster management one way or the other. For instance, the government, security forces and other partners annually organize simulation and drill exercises before the onset of monsoon season. These exercises are important in diagnosing shortfall in disaster response plan and mechanisms and help in fostering strong working relationships among the responders.
The Department of Hydrology and Meteorology has been providing three-day and the long-range forecasts. Based on these weather forecasts, authorities disseminate early warning messages to the communities. The local governments and relief organizations are able to implement some preventive and mitigative measures before there is a flood.
Also, there is an ongoing discourse on strict implementation of land use policy to reduce the impacts of hazards. The land use regulations that prohibit construction on risky land such as flood plains contribute to averting the disaster. “Traditionally, the community and its leaders have set norms and rules on the land use and zoning of land. The land was classified based on its nature and topography. But these days with boom in real estate every piece of land, even dangerously sloping land, is being bulldozed,” says Khagendra Pant, local high school teacher in Bhajani, Kailali.
The NDRRMA is leading scenario-based preparedness which involves analyzing underlying risk and vulnerabilities to different hazards and developing caseloads. The authority asks different ministries, departments and partners to prepare a plan based on those scenarios and caseloads. It also involves measuring a community’s capability to respond effectively—such as planning for the evacuation sites for people living with disability. The NDRRMA has embraced the principles of risk management in its disaster preparedness and response approach. Risk-based emergency planning involves assessment of the risk a community is likely to face, and estimation of probable impacts associated with these risks over a specific period. The process of identifying, analyzing and prioritizing risk is increasingly regarded as the optimal means to allocate scarce emergency management resources.
Call to action
The underlying risk posed by the climate change and unpredictability in the hazard patterns warrant anticipatory governance to take preventative and mitigating approaches in saving lives and livelihood. It’s high time we made disaster response and recovery work more predictable, accountable, and responsive. With these unprecedented challenges, the policy development requires speed. Some policies must be developed and updated within a short period of time. The scope of the policy work and problem of the communities need to be adequately diagnosed. Additionally, resources from each level of government should be brought to the table and inter-governmental collaboration should be forged. This is how a system that is able to respond to the unexpected crises arising from climate change can be built.
To make disaster response anticipatory, a multi-hazard early warning system has to be put in place. A system that is able to cope with any foreseen and unforeseen crisis requires updating and activating the communication networks across provinces, districts, local bodies and practitioners."

Foreign Minister Narayan Khadka’s comments about the SPP in the House, the US Embassy’s briefing to journalists, the statement issued by the Nepal Army (NA) and speeches by politicians in accordance with their interests have created confusions instead of clarifying about SPP.
The US Embassy invited journalists and stated that no draft of SPP agreement has been submitted to the Government of Nepal. It also claimed that Nepal had applied to participate in SPP in 2015 and 2017, and the application was approved in 2019.
The then Nepal Army (NA) Chief Rajendra Chhetri had applied for partnership on both the occasions and the NA had copied both the applications to the Defense Ministry and the Foreign Ministry of Nepal, according to the US Embassy.
The NA issued a statement Wednesday evening claiming that no agreement or understanding has been signed about the SPP. ""The Nepal Army has not signed any agreement or understanding about the SPP with the US Army or government, and there is no process toward signing such agreement,"" the NA statement says. ""The Nepal Army is always clear about the objective fact about not doing military partnership in the future with anyone in a way that can adversely affect the non-aligned foreign policy adopted by Nepal and Nepal's special geopolitical location and strategic sensitivities.""
The NA statement has mentioned that no agreement or understanding has been signed about the SPP but it has not spoken about the claims of the US Embassy that it had first applied for participation in 2015 and then again in 2017.
No agreement needs to be signed to participate in the SPP going by what the US Embassy says. Interested countries apply for participation and America accepts the application.
The Government of Nepal should now inform the House about all the facts related to SPP issuing a white paper. The issue will continue to create suspicions otherwise. It will become an issue for political one-upmanship and allegations and counter-allegations.
The NA must have copies of the applications submitted by the then NA Chief Chhetri in 2015 and 2017. The US Embassy’s claims that both the applications were also copied to the Defense Ministry and the Foreign Ministry of Nepal hint that the two ministries also have copies of the applications. The letter that Chhetri had sent in 2015 when KP Sharma Oli was prime minister (PM) has been made public Thursday.
But the letter said to have been sent in 2017 has yet to be made public and what exactly was written in that letter has yet to be known. America has said that it allowed Nepal to join the SPP in 2019 on the basis of these two applications.
The Government of Nepal should seek answers from America if the intention of those two letters was not to become part of the SPP and ask for removal of Nepal’s name from its website.
The government and the NA cannot be irresponsible and just say that they have not signed any agreement when America has listed Nepal as a member country of the SPP.
What may actually have happened is the NA asked for help from the US Army in disaster management after the Gorkha Earthquake in 2015. It may have applied for the SPP after the US Army likely responded that such assistance can be provided after receiving application for the SPP. The NA may again have applied in 2017 for similar assistance.
We don’t believe that the NA or the government led by any politician will knowingly decide to enter a long-term military partnership with America. Nobody seems to be in a state to definitively say about all the aspects related to the SPP today. Politicians, be those inside the government or in the opposition, seem more confused. They, however, are resorting to allegations and counter-allegations against each other even in this confusion. They are spending the time they should invest on understanding the issue and unearth the facts in making allegations.
CPN-UML—which has been the loudest in raising questions about the SPP both inside the House and outside to try to show that it is the only nationalist party, and create doubts about patriotism of others—is in an awkward position after it has been revealed that the first application for participation in the SPP was sent when the party led the government.
CPN (Maoist Center) Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal seems to be in haste to allege that Oli made the deal as he led the government when America accepted Nepal’s application in 2019.
This nature of our politicians to resort to inflammatory allegations and counter-allegations on sensitive national issues instead of displaying appropriate gravity and sensitivity is not new. The allegations that politicians knowingly or unknowingly have levelled against each other since 1951 about nationalism and foreign policy have made Nepal weak in the eyes of foreigners the most. Leaders and parties are unfortunately repeating the same irresponsibility and rhetoric even on the issue of SPP.
We believe the politicians who try to depict only themselves as nationalists and always attack on patriotism and integrity of others, and publicly slander others calling them brokers are fake nationalists.
The need of the hour is to find out truth and facts about the SPP, make them public and conclude the issue forging national unity. The SPP is not merely a program for the US Army to assist other countries in issues including disaster management as claimed by the US Embassy and Foreign Minister Khadka in the House. Those things are also part of the SPP but the SPP is more than that.
An article about the main objectives of the SPP by a former chief of the American National Guard that cooperates with armies of different countries clarifies how broad the SPP’s scope is and what its main objectives are.
This definitely does not mean that the NA should not establish any relations with the US Army. The NA has relations with the armies of India, China, US and other countries for years. The NA participates in joint exercises with the Indian and Chinese armies every year. It also holds joint drills with the US Army.
The US Army has been providing training to the NA on disaster management, search and rescue, counter-terrorism and other areas. NA officials go to American war colleges and other organizations for studies and training on a regular basis. This practice had been continuing even before Nepal applied for the SPP.
What necessitated Nepal’s application for the SPP in recent years? How can we be assured that this application incorporates only these areas of cooperation between the NA and the US Army? Who will give the assurance?
Nepal cannot, and must not, enter the wide spectrum of partnership between the two armies under the SPP. On the one hand, we have our geopolitical sensitivity, and we have our constitutional commitment and responsibility toward non-aligned foreign policy on the other. If we follow the simple formula of aligning with all world powers on matters of economy and development while remaining non-aligned on strategic matters, it will not only help us achieve economic gains but also protect us from strategic tensions and risks.
Are the common people expecting too much from the political parties if they want all political parties to consign their past invectives against each other to history and stand together. If not, let us first make public all the facts related to the SPP through a white paper in the sovereign parliament. After that, let all the major political parties reach an agreement on how to resolve the issue of SPP.
Let the series of abusing and doubting each other on the issue of nationalism and foreign policy be stopped. Let us make Nepal a mature country that does not harm anyone, strongly stand for her interests, participates with everyone economically but remain strategically non-aligned in the eyes of our neighbors and friendly countries.
Are the politicians ready for that?"
98,view,https://en.setopati.com/view/158294,"The committee formed by the government to invstigate the allegations made against Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) Governor Maha Prasad Adhikari reminds of kangaroo courts that autocrats across the world form to persecute their opponents and rivals.
Finance Minister Janardan Sharma has got Adhikari suspended by influencing Prime Minister (PM) Sher Bahadur Deuba due to his ego and prejudice, and got a committee formed through the Cabinet to investigate Adhikari.
Sharma has not been able to publicly defend suspension of governor of an autonomous body like the NRB. Governors are not generally suspended unless they show serious moral depravity or knowingly harm the country. They must never be suspended on the basis of policy differences. 
The NRB can adopt a policy that differs from that of the government based on the needs of the economy. Political parties can disrupt the country's economy in accordance to their short-term interests or political needs. The NRB has been given autonomy precisely to ensure that it can pay attention to stability of the economy through monetary policy to stop that.  
Governor Adhikari had implemented the NRB policies in coordination with the government policies even in practice. The NRB and the government coordinate their policies at normal times and the finance secretary is kept in the NRB board for that purpose.
Adhikari has not acted to harm the economy defying the government or flouting government's instructions. He instead intervened and prevented hike in interest rate for a long time to fulfill the finance minister's wish to increase loan investment by banks keeping a low interest rate, and     raise economic activities and the economic growth rate. That is seen to have increased flow of cheap money into the economy, increased import and put pressure on foreign currency reserves now.
Some policies adopted with good intention can prove to be wrong in the long run and put pressure on the economy. No economy would suffer crisis if all the policies were proved right and accurate prediction of a crisis were possible. There is no country in the world that has never suffered an economic crisis. All the state organs, therefore, should have come together to find a solution to the problem currently facing our economy without blaming anyone.
Finance Minister Sharma instead has alleged Adhikari of not cooperating with the government, harming the economy, leaking important economic information among others to avenge on an absolutely different issue.
It is not hidden from anyone that Sharma has attacked Adhikari after revelations that he took initiative to release the money transferred in the name of Prithvi Bahadur Shah from America that the NRB has frozen after America requested the central bank to investigate and return the amount back to America suspecting that it may have arrived through money laundering or fraud. To take an initiative to release the amount that has been red-flagged by America was a serious mistake on part of the finance minister.
That he got the governor suspended suspecting that Adhikari leaked the information and a committee formed including persons close to him to investigate that shows that he is intent on practicing vigilante justice.
The kind of persons included in the 'kangaroo committee' formed on initiative of Sharma gives away what his intentions are. The committee that Sharma has got constituted through the Cabinet including a former justice who is his relative and two party cadres has ended the possibility of fair investigation of allegations made against the governor and chances for justice.
Constitution of such 'kangaroo committee' has made mockery of justice. Responsibility for that now lies not just with Sharma but Chairman of the Cabinet that formed the 'kangaroo committee' and his party Nepali Congerss (NC). Neither PM Deuba nor NC can now run away from that.
Practising 'kangaroo court' and vigilante justice is not new for the Maoists that had practiced so during the armed insurgency. But how could NC agree for that? It should declare whether any citizen has the right for fair investigation of allegations made against her in a liberal and democratic society it has promised to the people. Whether that is a fundamental right for any citizen in today's Nepal or not?  If yes, why is that right of Governor Adhikari denied? How could a Cabinet meeting attended by PM Deuba form such a 'kangaroo committee' on whims of Minister Sharma? On what basis the Deuba Cabinet endorsed such a decision that attacks the autonomy granted to the NRB and its governor by the law?
These questions raised against PM Deuba and NC led by him are not simple. This Cabinet decision to form the 'kangaroo committee' attacks the very trust that the people have on NC for  the kind of values and norms it swears allegiance to.
The only way to correct the mistake now is to revoke the 'kangaroo committee' and withdraw the suspension of Governor Adhikari. 
NC should mull whether the public trust on it for its values and norms is important or transient interests of ruling coalition and defnse of the finance minister's whims are?"
99,view,https://en.setopati.com/view/158189,"Surgery is considered as one of the very rewarding disciplines providing good amount of personal and professional job satisfaction. Unfortunately, it is also considered as one of the most stressful professions. Both during the period of surgical training as well as clinical practice, people are prone to developing burnout due to excessive stress. Predisposing factors could be multiple. Multiple studies published overseas have demonstrated that the burnout rate among the surgical trainees and practicing surgeons is very high in comparison to other specialties.
Why surgeons are prone to stress?
In surgical specialties, the job demands extreme amount of hard work, both mentally and physically. Besides this, the working hours are extra-long and just not limited to fixed schedules, and the on-call duties are extremely tiring and long. Most of the times the surgeons are dealing with life-and-death situations and one small error either in judgment or skill can prove fatal. At some busy centers the surgeons are overloaded with patients too. Moreover, the training in surgical specialties is extremely prolonged and even after completing their general and specialty trainings they further need supervised working environment to gain good amount of exposure and develop enough confidence. Each individual surgeon can work independently only after that. These prolonged period of training leads to disbalance in their professional and personal life. Similarly, the compulsion to excel both in academics and surgical practice as well as trying to balance with economical aspects are important factors leading to development of burnout among surgeons. Failure to achieve balance in academic, clinical practice and personal life is again the most important factor for the development of stress among surgeons. Sometimes the pressure on the surgeons by the administration to increase performance also adds up the stress among the surgeons who are already prone to stress because of various predisposing factors. Increasing possibility of dealing with litigations in surgical practice is also one of the strongest factors for surgeons to experience stress and develop burnouts.
What is the prevalence of stress among surgeons?
Apart from some anecdotal reports and expert viewpoints, there has been no published study on this subject matter in Nepal till date. This is one of the very important areas to be researched in Nepal as surgical training and clinical practice in surgical specialties are increasingly becoming very challenging and competitive, and also invite risk of litigations. The number of surgeons in the country has also significantly increased. One US study published in “Surgery” journal in 2001, University of Michigan-Ann Arbor, did a survey on 582 surgeons. Overall, 32% surgeons showed high levels of emotional exhaustion, 13% depersonalization and 4% showed low sense of personal accomplishment. Young surgeons were found to be more vulnerable to suffering stress. Similarly, another Australian study published in ANZ journal of Surgery in 2007 evaluated 126 Surgeons. They found that the surgeons were suffering high level of burnout than the general population. Around 48% of the surgeons surveyed reported high burnout levels. Besides these published reports, there are plenty of other overseas publications supporting the fact that the surgeons are very prone to developing burnout and suffering from stress. It has also been found that the experienced surgeons are more likely to have higher management ability as compared to those younger ones and with fewer years of experience.
What is the effect of stress among surgeons?
Burnout and stress can spill over to personal and professional life. Burnouts can lead to emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and low personal accomplishment. Besides this, stress can be significant contributor to poor health of a surgeon. Anxiety and depression can both be a reason for serious health issues among very stressed and burnt out surgeons. Suffering from broken relationships to drug and alcohol dependence can be a serious issue and at extreme situations they are also prone to suicidal tendencies in lack of timely intervention. Stress and burnout lead to imbalance between personal and professional life which further adds to the suffering of already stressed surgeons and this vicious cycle can continue. Job performance further deteriorates in those surgeons already under stress. This can in fact affect the outcome of the patients being treated. Thus, stress and burnouts have serious consequences which are not just limited to the surgeon suffering from it but also can affect the patient being treated and overall health services of a center.
How can we prevent that?
Despite the high prevalence of stress and burnout among surgeons, there are still ways to reduce it although it can’t be completely avoided. There is no best way to prevent it because it needs to be individualized based on every individual’s working condition, environment, job responsibilities and personalities besides many other factors to be considered. There are plenty of ways described in various published literatures to reduce and prevent stress among surgeons and surgical trainees which could in fact be applied to any other specialty too. The past experience of handling the stressful situation can be adopted even during surgical training periods and in clinical practice too. Identifying priorities both in personal and professional life is a must. One should understand and know one's limits as to what extent to be devoted to surgery. It may not be very applicable during training but definitely an important issue to be considered while practicing as a professional surgeon. Not everyone can do everything and one should understand one's limits and potential. Getting inspired from others is definitely rewarding but comparing oneself to others can unnecessarily increase the stress. Trying to balance between clinical, academic and personal life which also includes the financial aspects is a must. Running after one single aspect is definitely going to be non-rewarding and there is possibility of developing stressful situation due to self-understood reasons. Working in a team, sharing responsibilities and asking for help whenever required are of utmost importance in preventing stress and burnout among surgeons. A very supporting family can definitely help dealing with stressful situations. However, not everyone could be lucky enough to have a very understanding family or a colleague. Reading articles, publications and books on stress management can also help significantly.  For those having a concerning level of stress and burnouts participation in formal stress management training programs and also getting timely medical interventions can help. From the administrative perspective, imposing scientifically correct working hours and workloads both on trainees and practicing surgeons can help avoid unnecessary stress and decrease burnouts among these vulnerable population.
In conclusion, surgery is a very rewarding yet stressful discipline due to various reasons and surgeons both as trainees and practicing surgeons are prone to developing burnout and suffering stress. This can have various consequences not just limited to individual but also affecting the whole system. Thus, efforts should be made at the individual level to the level of administrators and stakeholders to prevent and reduce the prevalence of stress and burnout among surgical trainees and practicing surgeons which then will help in creating a safe working environment for service providers as well as increasing the patient safety.

Public policy in general is conceptual roadmap for government to address specific public concerns and/or deliver specific constitutional mandates and it provides framework for ensuring legal, institutional, procedural, and resources (both human and financial) required to deliver the commitments of the particular public policy. Effectiveness of Nepal’s public polices has to be examined within this definitional framework.
For the past two years, I am heavily engaged in reviewing public polices, comparing different existing public polices and reviewing several new draft polices prepared by different ministries and government agencies. This process helped to understand how they are formulated, why they are formulated in that particular way, how effective they are implemented and why they fail. In this article I am reflecting on why public polices often fail in Nepal.
Reasons of public policies’ failure 
I found the following major reasons of ineffectiveness or even failure of public polices in Nepal:

Weakness in the policy formulation process: Lack of proper need assessment and weak prioritization, no sincere risk and opportunities assessment, not even proper definition of policy, no proper consultation with key stakeholders to collect their concerns and voices resulting in lack of ownership, very top-down process leading to few formal activities to meet the legal/procedural requirement, time pressure for quick delivery of policy, etc. Right policy formulation process often leads to higher possibility for effective implementation and vice versa. Hence, one of the major reasons of failure of public policy is lack of adopting right process.


Inconsistencies in content of policy formulation: Once there is lack of proper need identification, analysis and prioritization, appropriate risk assessment, lack of conceptual clarity in absence of definition, there is always possibility of inconsistencies and flaws/vagueness in the content. Because of lack of conceptual clarity, the whole document as well as individual policy statement is called policy. Many times the logical sequencing between a) policy statement, b) strategies and c) implementing guidelines are weak or missing, very vague statements with similar meaning are presented in policy statements, strategies and implementing guidelines.


Institutional mechanism: In most of the polices, there is no clear responsibilities of responsible institutions outlined and agreed, thereby creating confusion and lack of ownership in implementation. Most of the polices require engagement of several inter-ministerial institutions. Policies brought by one ministry with the responsibilities of implementation on another ministry is one of the main reasons for dysfunction.


Legal provisions: Several policy provisions demand legal back up for successful implementation. But most of the polices are prepared without proper assessment of legal situation (does any existing law inhibit implementation, is new law required to implement the policy etc.). Hence, once policy is formulated, many existing laws prohibit (e.g., forest law or park and people law) implementation or new laws are required. This situation must be assessed while making policy and clear legal provisions required to implement specific policy must be outlined in the policy. Further, unlike laws, there is no provision of punishment to concerned officials if he or she fails to implement particular policy resulting in impunity for lack of implementation.


Coordination: Lack of inter-ministerial and inter-agency coordination is another big barrier to implementing policy effectively, as scope of most of the policies (e.g., agriculture policy, urban development policy, water, sanitation and hygiene policy, etc.) goes beyond the remit of single ministry (eg, agriculture, irrigation, industries, trade and supply, finance, foreign affairs, home affairs ministries are related with agriculture policy). Hence, if proper consultation with concerned ministers at the beginning of policy formulation is not done and clear commitment not ensured, policy will not work.


Resources provisions: Many policies at the time of formulation do not assess the tentative financial and human resources requirements. Without proper projection of resources required for implementing the policy, possibility of its failure is high.
Time required for public policy formulation: Often Nepal’s public policies are formulated in a very short time (few weeks to hardly a few months) leaving aside important public consultation process because of pressure from minsters leading ultimately to lack of public ownership and failure. Depending on the gravity of topic, time span for a policy formulation process requires nine months and up to 10 years (for policies’ that are directly related with a large number of people, such as agriculture/health and sanitation, etc.).


Monitoring and evaluation: Most of the policies mention about monitoring and evaluation but there are no indicators (what to monitor/evaluate), no time frame (when to do), and assigning of responsibility. So, it remains simply a jargon statement.


Supplementary elaborations and documents: Complex polices require supplementary documents (strategies, guidelines, procedures etc.) that are not indicated in the policies but affect policy implementation.

Way ahead
Existing practice of policy formulation must be changed if we want to see public policy implemented. In this context, Policy Research Institute (PRI) has developed two guidelines related to public polices: one related to formulation of public polices and another related to reviewing public policies, to assist government ministries. Very brief synopsis of public policy formulation cycle is presented below:
Public Policy Formulation to follow the ‘Public Policy Formation Cycle’ that starts with

identification and analysis of policy issues,
prioritization of policy issues,
preliminary draft as per the standard format (developed by Policy Research Institute),
call for the public to give feedback and public dialogue over the preliminary draft,
revision of the preliminary draft based on the public feedback,
review of the revised draft by team of experts and adaptation of draft,
circulation at the public level for their comments and feedback on the draft (sending to all key stakeholders and requesting for their feedback and organization of a series of feedback meetings with stakeholders),
revision of the draft policy for finalization,
submission of the draft to cabinet committee for approval,
policy implementation,
policy evaluation (after 5 years of implementation) and decision of continuity, revision or need for new policy.

Completion of this process generally requires about nine months and in case of policies dealing with the concerns of large population such as health policy, agriculture policy, drinking water and sanitation policies and education policies years of continuous consultation and public debate is required. Now Nepal needs to change the present practice of policy formulation in terms of process, content, expected outcomes.

101,view,https://en.setopati.com/view/157918,"The country is currently polarized over the US$ 500 million grant the American government is providing through the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC). The MCC Compact signed between Nepal and America four years ago have yet to come into implementation in lack of ratification by the House.
The American government has already said that the amount will be given to another country if the MCC Compact is not ratified by the House by February end. The act of picking controversy over a grant agreement with a friendly nation four years after signing the agreement shows how pathetic and irresponsible our diplomacy is. Such an important issue that needs to be discussed in the House has not even been taken to the House.
The dispute, therefore, has reached the streets and even the dining table of the people. The politicians stayed mere spectators instead of becoming serious about such an important issues related to the country's future.  This further compounded matters. The MCC Compact should be tabled in the House without any delay and lawmakers should take a decision using their wisdom.
The then prime minister (PM) KP Sharma Oli had registered the MCC for discussion in the House when he led the CPN government. But the then speaker Krishna Bahadur Mahara did not allow discussion in the House on instruction of Pushpa Kamal Dahal who was chairman of ruling CPN along with Oli.
Agni Sapkota, who shares Maoist background with Mahara, also did not hold discussion amidst power struggle inside CPN after he became speaker. He did not just deny the government the right to take any bill or proposal of its choice to the House but also obstructed exercise of the sovereign right of the lawmakers elected by the people to hold discussion on those issues. This is unpardonable on the part of Sapkota in capacity of speaker. Speaker Sapkota should now take the MCC Compact for discussion without any excuse and delay. Whether to end the House obstruction for discussion or not is up to CPN-UML. He cannot shirk his responsibility pointing at UML.
Many political leaders have been irresponsible on the issue of MCC. CPN (Maoist Center) Chair Dahal has been the most irresponsible among the top leaders. He generally has a dual position on any issue. He has this habit of saying one thing one day and exactly the opposite the next day on any issue irrespective of gravity of the issue. He unfortunately swung like a pendulum even on the issue of MCC and bilateral relation with America.
He made a sensitive issue like MCC a tool for his power struggle inside the party in the beginning. He had said the MCC Compact will be ratified by the House in Kantipur Conclave a few years back. But he first used Mahara and then Sapkota, and stopped MCC's entry in the House as his relation with Oli soured.
Nepali Congress (NC) President Sher Bahadur Deuba had asked Dahal about the MCC Compact before forging the alliance to unseat Oli from pemiership. Deuba actually wanted to form the coalition government only after getting the MCC Compact ratified. Dahal had promised his party's support to pass the MCC Compact after forming the coalition government. But Dahal started to make conflicting remarks about MCC once the new government was formed. He claimed that he is not in favor of passing it inside his party even as he swore his support for the agreement with American officials. He told Deuba that he needs more time to convince comrades inside his party.
Dahal penned a joint letter to the MCC on September 29, 2021 along with PM Deuba after American officials said they will take back the amount if it is not endorsed by the House, and sought four-five months to create a favorable environment for MCC inside his party and in the country. He also promised to get the MCC Compact ratified in his official meetings with American officials in the intervening period. He did not raise the issue of amending the agreement in the joint letter sent to the MCC or during the multiple meetings with American officials. But he continued to tell leaders inside his party that the MCC Compact cannot be passed without amendment. So much so that he got the party's stance endorsed by the recent general convention. 
How can a top leader of a major party and a former PM act so irresponsibily? The country has suffered a huge loss due to his dual character. But he himself and his party has suffered an even greater loss due to that. Dahal continued to sell the dream of rebellion and state capture to the rank and file even after he gave up the armed rebellion and joined peaceful politics. He mentally sailed the two boats of peace and rebellion.
He and his party would have been in a far better position in Nepali politics now had he focused on transforming his party for peaceful politics and seeking resolution to the political, social and economic issues facing the country through the House right from the beginning. He has not even imagined the harm the dual nature he is showing now on the issue of MCC has incurred for him. He will face the consequences if he does not mend his ways.
The main opposition UML has also resorted to politicking on the issue of MCC in recent times. UML has put the party's interests above that of the country's even  though it may not be as shameless as Dahal's. As the issue of MCC gets trickier, there is risk of conflict of powerful countries intensifying inside Nepal and the country getting in a geopolitical tangle. That is not an issue of concern for just one party.
If all the parties come together, we cannot just evade the potential geopolitical mess but also have the opportunity of moving forward with a foreign policy based on a balanced relations with all the powerful countries. The country currently needs cognizance and cooperation from all the parties. But UML is busy counting its political gains and losses.
Setopati has always been clear on the issue of ratifying the MCC Compact. America definitely may have its strategic interest in the MCC just as China may have in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI|) and India in any other development project. But Nepal has not done any strategic deal in the MCC Compact it has signed. We will be bound only by the MCC Compact in the coming days. The issues mentioned in the MCC Compact are purely related only to development projects—construction of transmission lines essential for Nepal, and repair and maintenance of the roads.
There are many reasons for the issues in the agreement being dragged into controversy. Many do not know anything about this agreement. They have not even read the agreement but are opposing it on the basis of hearsay. Some are opposing in lack of understanding about how international treaties and agreements are drafted and their meaning. Some are not familiar about the language used in deals about development projects and are opposing it. Still others are opposing by misinterpreting the meaning of English language used in the agreement. And some are opposing it due to their prejudice.
The MCC Office has already sent written response to all the questions raised about the MCC. The MCC Compact itself has a provision allowing both Nepal and America to unilaterally revoke the deal giving a 30-day notice if they have any grievances regarding implementation of the Compact. We will always reserve the rights to walk away from the agreement giving a 30-day notice if Nepal does not agree with anything or America puts pressure to that regard after the MCC Compact comes into implementation. We must, therefore, get the MCC Compact ratified through the House and take it into implementation without any apprehension.  
Setopati is also clear about the issue of geopoliitcs. Nepal will have to maintain cordial and close relation with all the neighboring and powerful countries, and use that to our benefits.
We should not oppose any country for the sake of another, and not allow any to interfere in the relation with another. India wanted Nepal to not sign the BRI and had even quietly lobbied for that. We had said we should sign the BRI with China even then. We are also clear that we should build better relation with the northern neighbor. We should not allow India or America to interfere in our relation with China just like we should not allow China to covertly or overtly interfere in our relation with India or America.  
Only that will provide an opportunity for us to maintain close relation with all the powerful countries and reap benefits from that. Nepal will become a playground for powerful countries if Nepal supports or opposes any country for the sake of another. That will spell trouble for us in the long run. 
The lawmakers, therefore, should think seriously about the issue and take a decision based on their wisdom. The people have elected lawmakers prescisely to discuss and decide about such important and tricky issues. They should fulfill that responsibility handed over by the electorate."
102,view,https://en.setopati.com/view/157791,"Nepali politics has suddenly become heated in the middle of the winter on the issue of when to hold parliamentary and local elections. Different positions of the parties have been made public while the Constitution and election laws are also being interpreted differently.
Parties are currently making different interpretations of Article 225 of the Constitution and clause 3 of the Local Election Act.
Article 225 states that the term of rural assembly and municipal assembly will be five years, and election for the next rural assembly and municipal assembly should be held within six months of end of that term.
Clause 3 of the Local Election Act, on the other hand, states that members will be elected two months before the term of rural assembly and municipal assembly expires.
CPN (Maoist Center) Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal has argued that local election can be held in November-December pointing that the Constitution prevails if provision of other laws contradict the Constituion.
Some legal experts point that the Constitution and the election act talk about rural assembly and municipal assembly and not rural municipality and municipality.
Election of 753 rural and municipal assemblies can be, and have been, held on separate days depending on the choice and convenience of elected local representatives. The experts point that there would have been no dispute now if the act had mentioned that election should be held two months before the term of member of rural municipality and municipal expires.  
No matter how the parties interpret these provisions now, we all know that the parties were careful about two things at the time of promulgating the Constitution.
One is the term of local bodies will be five years and the local bodies will not be left without leadership in lack of election due to the bitter experience of local bodies remaining without elected people's representatives for around two decades. The leaders were as careful about local bodies not remaning without leadership as they were about the House not being dissolved before completing its five-year term.
Another is ruling parties should not unilaterally change election date, and basic laws like election laws, laws about splitting political parties and appointment at constitutional bodies because they are directly related to the institution and system of democracy. If there is no discussion and consensus among the parties represented in the House about such issues, that derails the system and institution itself.
We had, therefore, strongly protested when KP Sharma Oli unilaterally amended the laws about splitting political parties and appointment at constitutional bodies when he was prime minister (PM) to serve his narrow interest.
The ruling coalition seems to be trying to amend election laws and change election date due to similar self-interests. The ruling coalition has its own onterests in first holding the federal election in April-May and the local election in November-December.
The ruling coalition cannot ally in all 753 local bodies as cadres of Nepali Congress (NC) will not allow that. CPN (Unified Socialist) and even Maoist Center will struggle to win local bodies if the parties in the coalition ally.
The ruling alliance will be under huge psychological pressure if the two communist parties fare poorly in the local election. NC does not want the two parties to seem weak before the general election. If the two parties seem weaker, that will benefit CPN-UML and hurt NC's prospects in the general election.
The ruling alliance may also feel that vacancy in the local bodies will benefit the coalition as UML had won at more places than other parties in the last local election.
Sher Bahadur Deuba has been accused of keeping the local bodies without elected leadership for two decades in the past. PM Deuba should not lead the act of keeping local bodies without elected leadership even this time.
There are many things that need to be reformed in the election process. Holding election of all three levels of government together will not just save the state's coffers in election expenditure but also mean that decisions about development projects, transfer and promotion of staffers and other issues need not be stopped repeatedly due to the election code of conduct that comes into effect before the election.
There are many such issues that the parties represented in the parliament have to sit together and agree for electoral reform to make our democracy more  polished. There will definitely be a solution if the parties sit together and agree to hold the three elections together either in April-May or November-December.
But the ruling coalition should not unilaterally amend election laws or push back the election date if the parties to fail to agree on these issues. There should be local election in April-May and provincial and federal elections in November-December if there is no consensus.  
The government should not again invite political  mayhem by deciding otherwise."
103,view,https://en.setopati.com/view/157157,"Industry Minister Gajendra Hamal has resigned 40 hours after appointment. Hamal has said he has resigned listening to his conscience after widespread criticism of the appointment. Baluwatar has tried to spin the resignation by Hamal of his own volition to save its face. The press note issued by Baluwatar mentions that Hamal has resigned on request of Prime Minister (PM) Sher Bahadur Deuba even as audio recording of Hamal requesting to broadcast/publish the issue through the media pointing that Deuba may reject his resignation has been made public.
One fact has been irrefutably established despite all the efforts of damage control by Baluwatar. The democracy in Nepal has been attacked in an unimaginable manner last week.
Politicians and people in the judiciary can some time commit mistakes in course of work and do work that should not be done. But the deed of PM Deuba and Chief Justice (CJ) Cholendra Shumsher Rana with consent of the top leaders of ruling coalition is an unthinkable crime in democracy. CJ seeking share of spoils in the government and the ruling parties accepting that is unimaginable in democracy.
The main source of this misdeed is CJ Rana, and his unconstitutional aspirations. Rana had the temerity to seek a share in power violating the sanctity of judiciary believing he can do anything he wishes.
The ruling coalition should have strongly resisted this impudence by CJ Rana. But the coalition easily accepted his demand reflecting at once the gratitude of the coalition toward some of the past verdicts by CJ and fear that he may put the government in another crisis.
Rana has been enjoying the fallout of the havoc he has wreaked from the sacred chair of CJ and making mockery of democracy. It is not hard to see that Rana has been influencing the court’s verdicts in a way that benefits one party or another, and reaping political benefits for that.
Two major verdicts by the Supreme Court (SC) in cases related to political parties are now under suspicion. The SC verdict to revoke unification of CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Center) restoring the two parties to the state before unification in a case related to the unified party using name of another registered party was against the Constitution, laws and jurisdiction of the judiciary. That verdict was unimaginable.  
The refusal by the SC to issue an interim order in the case against the ordinance making splitting of parties easier issued hastily by the Deuba government after suddenly ending the House session, and subsequent delay in issuing final verdict in the case have also raised suspicions. Every government has undermined the parliament by bringing ordinance and tampered with laws for its vested interests. There will be no meaning of democratic norms of the people’s representatives formulating laws and the rule of law if that is not controlled.
The SC recently had revoked the ordinance brought by the KP Oli government to amend the act related to citizenship immediately after dissolving the House. The court had done a commendable job of curbing the autocratic tendency of the executive to rule through ordinances by avoiding the parliament. The final verdict in that case would have set a good precedent and curbed abuse of powers bolstering democracy and rule of law.
But the SC has again treaded the wrong path in the case related to the ordinance about splitting of parties. The SC has blatantly ignored the precedent it established in the ordinance related to citizenship. The double standard of the Apex Court in cases related to two similar ordinances has not just hit the credibility of the judiciary but raised suspicions that CJ Rana influences court verdicts to serve his immoral interests in connivance with political parties. CJ Rana has himself proved the suspicions to be true by accepting his share in Cabinet expansion.
Opposing such immoral acts of CJ is not opposing the judiciary or attacking the dignity of the court. The judiciary is not an individual justice or CJ, for that matter, who does not remain within the limits and disregards the sanctity of the judiciary.
Condemning such justices rather saves the judiciary and all those honest justices who continuously work with constitutional integrity and cannot even think about treading the path Rana has taken. Slamming Rana will save the justices who twice revived the House dissolved unconstitutionally by Oli going against Rana’s wishes. Criticizing Rana will safeguard the public trust over those very justices who have not participated in the political dealmaking of Rana.
We should not forget here that CJ Rana agreed to reinstate the House for the first time only after three justices in the five-strong constitutional bench stood for House reinstatement. Two justices refused to stay in the constitutional bench formed by CJ Rana in the case against the second dissolution by Oli. The rest of the justices then forced Rana to constitute the bench on the basis of seniority. The constitutional bench formed on the basis of seniority then reinstated the House.  
The current transgression by Rana has provided an opportunity to UML leaders to claim that the verdict for House reinstatement was also given on the basis of political machination. Rana in this way has not just dragged other SC justices working with honesty and integrity into suspicion but also gravely reduced the credibility of the judiciary.
CJ Rana would have deserved impeachment if politicians at the top were not complicit in such grave crimes. Merely demanding share in government would be sufficient to impeach a CJ in a well-functioning democracy. But our politicians are so lowly and decadent that they are condemned to fulfilling the quota demanded by CJ in appointments in the government and constitutional bodies. Oli gave Rana share in appointments in constitutional bodies when he was PM. Deuba gave Rana a share even in the Cabinet this time.
Our politicians will not muster moral courage to impeach Rana due to this background. The responsibility to resist the immoral deeds of Rana is now on the judiciary itself. The SC justices, the Nepal Bar Association, and the SC Bar Association must seriously carry out consultations. Such incidents erode the legitimacy of democracy and undermine rule of law, and the courageous stand of people with integrity and honesty at such times will instill life in democracy and save democracy.
Nepali Congress (NC) that considers itself to be the mother of parliamentary democracy in Nepal and its leaders and cadres also have a huge responsibility. Maoist Center Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who does not respect or believe in parliamentary democracy a bit, defending Hamal’ appointment is not surprising because he believes all the means toward climbing to power and staying are fair. But NC leaders and cadres should seriously contemplate whether corruption of the executive by an immoral and whimsical CJ is acceptable in parliamentary democracy or not? Whether the party president who has committed such a grave attack and crime against democracy is acceptable or not? Whether the party president can continue to lead the party and government in the coming days or not? Why should the Nepali people bear with Deuba who undermines democracy, Constitution and the party ideals every time he reaches power even if the party leaders and cadres consider him fit to be party president? Why should NC under Deuba again be sent to the government?
The coming days will show how people in the judiciary retaliate against CJ’s arbitrariness or those in NC will resist Deuba. But one thing is absolutely clear. Deuba and Rana, and not Hamal, are the ones who should be punished in this episode. The attack on democracy by PM Deuba and CJ Rana, who have repeatedly failed to maintain clean image even in the past, this time has plummeted their image to the nadir of ignominy. History will not absolve them of this ignominy."

106,blog,https://en.setopati.com/blog/160781,"It appears that the current generation of loving couples getting married in Nepal in an urban context are enchanted and enthralled by the idea of a soulmate. Hence, the idea of someone being your soulmate keeps trending on different social networking sites as an ideal version of being in love together. Although the current generation of loving couples has an idealized image of a soulmate, in reality, for many people, the idea of finding and living with a social mate remains limited to mere appearances—just a tagline posted along with a visual representation of togetherness shared on different social networking sites.
Our everyday idea about the soulmate falls short of its ideals because we rely on imitations of plastic images of love trending in different mediums of pop culture, compare and contrast our possible loving partners with superficial expressions of other loving couples, and also follow the suggestions and guidelines of other people to identify and determine our soulmate. Similarly, we have misguided expectations about a soulmate as someone who brings a sense of security and feelings of comfort, along with the promise of everlasting love, into our lives.
Besides, our criteria for falling in love with another person are such that we give more preference and priority to what the person has, like a bank balance, a green card, a dependent visa, social status, and a handsome or beautiful face, than to who he or she is as a person with inner human qualities such as honesty, trustworthiness, understanding, commitment, and caring.
Many people miss their soulmates because they are so out of touch with their inner lives as individuals that they remain unaware of the person who is carrying the beats of her heart inside his own. Soulmates get married because they are for each other, not for any other reason.
More importantly, without anything as such to connect with, enrich, and nourish a loving relationship together from within, being in love without a soulmate becomes utterly boring, shallow, lost in appearances, and meaningless. Being in love without a soulmate is a tedious struggle of finding one temporary delight after another in the outer world to justify and demonstrate the shallow and soulless love people have for each other.
The idea of each of us having a soulmate was first put forth by Greek philosopher Plato, who in his seminal work Symposium stated that each of us has another half of our own soul in another physical body; hence, as human beings, we have this inner, irresistible yearning for that interconnection with another being that would make us feel undivided and complete, and as long as soulmates remain separated, there will always be an inner sense of lack, as if things are missing out, out of touch, shallow, and incomplete.
Similarly, in Hindu religious tradition, we have the divine union between Goddess Parvati and Lord Shiva as Shiva and Shakti expressed in a singular being, Ardhanarishwar; this mythological narrative is a symbolic representation of reunion between soulmates. Indeed, the struggles and sacrifices of Devi Parvati to belong with Lord Shiva indicate that when it comes to a spiritual journey to find a soulmate, it is not about what other people say or what options or preferences you have; to find a soulmate, you must exercise your freedom, follow your inner voice and its determination, and stand strong with your courage. First, you have to connect and stand firm on your true self to find your true lover.
Hence, to get in touch with your soulmate, first of all, you need to listen to the soft whisper reverberating from your heart that gently tells you she may not be the charming person of your dreams, but it feels as if even as strangers, we have already met for thousands of times. There may have been other lovers of youth, beauty, possession, admiration, and passion, but only she can reach deep inside your heart and understand you just the way you are.
Finding your soulmate would be like stumbling onto someone you are surprised to realize has been shaped and carved like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle that fit together only with you. With your soulmate, you get that feeling of being at ease within yourself, and there is no need for any other stimulus or incentive apart from each other’s presence to get a sense of interconnection out of this relationship.
Moreover, soulmates are two individuals who have realized that promising romantic love forever is a lie. Falling in love is easy, but the art of remaining committed to each other in love takes many years of practice to perfect. Even when their love is the glue that binds them together, soulmates understand that for their relationship to last, they need to support each other's motivations, interests, and inspirations and find commonalities between them.
Being in love as soulmates means that we are both willing to make struggles and sacrifices for each other because we both realize that our love has the potential to improve, transform, redefine, and make the best out of our lives altogether. Besides, soulmates don’t play the game of pretending to remain at the center of each other’s attention, and they don't want the other person to become the shadow of their expectations, anticipations, and projections.
To conclude, soulmates are two individuals with a sense of shared self that allows them to blend in, support, and sustain each other's beings together. Where there are differences, soulmates supplement and become each other’s inspiration and strength, and where there are similarities, they explore, enhance, and enjoy their mutual interests and passions together. When soulmates sit together and engage in laughter, dialogue, making love, silence, or discussions, they realize that their loving relationship gives their lives a sense of purpose together, which makes them feel complete and inseparable from each other.

107,blog,https://en.setopati.com/blog/160767,"Those words from my lovely wife ended our argument in the kitchen last night.
The night before that, a minor difference in opinion had flickered into a tiny spark and by the time Hegel got involved the next day, it had turned into an inferno.
Before we move on, let’s get to know a little about Hegel so it can help us understand where these two loving souls, my wife and I, usually depart and seldom meet again.
Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel was a German Philosopher and was considered as the most important figures in German philosophy and one of the founding figures of modern Western philosophy. Leaving all the things he’s said aside, the one thing that has struck a chord with me is his theory on “shape of consciousness”. 
Hegel says simply put, we cannot trust the certitude of our sense organs, also called sense-certainty, because that certitude is embroiled in limitations. Add to that, the human consciousness, and language upon which all sense-making is forced. That leaves no room for subjective agency. Our means of understanding our reality are encouraged, sustained, inspired, and tolerated by those sets of very weak and humanistic attributes. We are flawed in our take of our reality because the moment we set our eyes on something, it takes a form of what it means for us. 
Not what it is in its real essence, but what it means to a human mind.
Imagine a botanist, a wood cutter and a CEO of a furniture company taking a walk in a forest. What they see when they look around are trees and nothing but trees. 
In essence what a tree is, in-itself, they will never know. They cannot catch themselves seeing those trees from anywhere else beyond what their human mind lets them see.
The botanist will see the trees in terms of cambiums and apical meristem. 
The woodcutter will see those trees in terms of his livelihood and his children’s tuition.
The CEO will see them in terms of how many desks his company could produce from the wood of those trees.
The tree’s essence, what it is, and why it is what it is, can never find a place of its individuality because the human mind, limited within its Hegelian purview, will eat up that possibility before anything else.
The tree can never be a tree in itself. Instead, it must be a tree for those three people.
Thomas Nagel, one of my other to-go thinkers wrote a paper back in 1974 titled ‘What is it like to be a bat?’ There is no amount of knowledge or information about a bat that can tell us what it feels like to be a bat within the confines of its bat consciousness. 
Its hunger, its love, its breezing along the meandering swoops and its revulsions against other fellow bats--those we shall never know. The best we could do is anthropomorphize it, like we always do in animation movies where animals tend to live up to human aspirations. 
A human mind is incapable of experiencing a bat’s experience and therefore will never know how a bat might feel. There simply is not a way for anyone of us to know. Let’s be totally asserted on that truth.
In the similar manner, a botanist, a woodcutter, and my lovely wife, how’s their experience any more different from the run-down of that bat’s experience we could relate to?
Fundamentally, their personal experience that’s accessible only to them, be it during the stroll in the forest or the grunt in the kitchen, are theirs to have. I can sit here and try to relativize a woodcutter’s coveting or my wife’s annoyances, but that won’t move the dial if their shape of consciousness is absent from my reach. I can never know how she feels if I can’t own her in totality.
And this is where Hegel comes along to enlighten the predicament of the misrepresentations that becomes a foundational springboard in understanding the shape of the other person’s consciousness.
Our minds, our feelings and everything we claim as ours are cusped within the confines of our personal sense-making. Our experiences become relatable only if we can find a medium to universalize it in terms of human graces or grunts.
I don’t know if Hegel can truly do my wife’s dishes or not.
I am positive he will not because he died long before both of us were born.
Nonetheless, Hegel does remind us that in absence of common reference, our words will fail us miserably. 
And when that happens our silence, perhaps, will hold more meaning."
108,blog,https://en.setopati.com/blog/160701,"A dear friend that I have known for decades took his life last week leaving behind a wife, two children and many of us who have not been able to claim back our sanity. There are ten thousand unrelenting questions that are hitting hard on us, and they are not easily going away. It’s been an unsettling week for all of us.
When a tragedy like this happens, it doesn’t take place amidst the clamor of reason and resonance.
Instead, a decision like this is made in the retreat of a cool, calm, and collected mind. At least, that’s what Karl Menninger meditates in ‘Man against Himself’, a brilliant psychiatrist who tries to comprehend why an individual wishes to put himself in a harm’s way from which he cannot, except by suicide, escape from his life.
In other words, if for his own unconscious purpose, a man brings about an apparent justification in external reality for self-destruction, then the unconscious purposes are of more significance in understanding the suicide than the apparently simple, inevitable, external circumstance that are observable to the public. For folks like you and me, the laziest and the most reckless way to make sense of someone’s decision is to try to understand his subjective decision from an objective point of view.
What Menninger is saying humbly is this.
What happens out there are particles simply hitting each other and producing a state of affairs that, when viewed from a frog’s point of view or a bird eye-view, are nothing but occasions passing along space and time. However, when we introduce a human mind to that same state of affairs, everything changes. 
Humans carry an unhealthy number of covenants, rules, positivity, and ought-to-be-ness that sometimes are anti-life. It works more against them than for them. 
In essence, what kills a man under such circumstances is not what’s out there in the world but what’s within him. His provisional compass becomes the contingent arbiter, the judge, the jury, and the noose that can take away his life. At least, that’s what happened with my friend, it looks like.
I can only imagine or perhaps not, what must have gone through his mind in those last forlorn moments of despair and disquietude. I will never find out how many sins he thought he had committed when he compared his external world to Bhagavat Geeta that espouses on being a good human being. I will never find out how much short he found himself in the eyes of Hindu Gods and other deities that had, in his last moments, become toxic for him.
Jordan Peterson is a clinical psychiatrist who perhaps is the most articulate man alive on our planet- at least that’s what the New York Times quotes him to be. 
Peterson makes an appeal to all, not to advise another human being on what should or should not be done, simply because you may screw up that person’s life. It doesn’t matter where such guidance comes from. 
Be it from the voice from heaven or from the Apollo of Delphi or from our own Krishna’s chariots from Kurukshetra. Where they come from is irrelevant but what they render to a human mind is absolutely calamitous.
These oracular voices tend to be more harmful and are totally responsible for human suffering. They create a paradigm in men upon which he is constrained to build up his sense of right and wrong. And life, as you all know, is a roller coaster ride, simply because there’s always a chance for us to spill out of that paradigm. 
Our agency, perhaps our only tool to understand the reality may not always square perfectly with Bhagavad Gita’s diatribes against the sins that men are capable of committing. And that is exactly why no one should be damned because none can control the reality of the world. There seems no room for agency in a world of neural impulses, chemical reactions, and bone and muscle movements. Even if we add sensations, perceptions, and feelings we don’t get action, or doing—there is only what happens.
Under such conditions, my friend who perhaps didn’t find his external reality 'squarely checked’ with his internal covenants saw no point in prolonging his life because he must have gotten lost on his way with no structure to guide him through. The virtues that he adhered so deeply had no place in the world he found himself in. The gods were gone.
He must have found himself in that forlorn Nietzschean world where god lived no more.
There were two ways to fix his problem from what I can tell.
First one was to fix the reality which essentially meant to reorganize the particles that was noumenally visible to him so it would evenly square with his virtues. 
The second was to kill the gods so the world would become livable where he could breathe again.
Unfortunately, both options were not available to him. And the one that he did choose, only that made all the difference to him."
109,blog,https://en.setopati.com/blog/160561,"With the massive popularity and abundance of spiritual leaders, gurus, religious groups, religious media channels, and self-help publications, the concept of spirituality has become an integral part of our collective psyche. As a result, many people believe that spiritual perspectives, techniques, and exercises can be applied to solve various mental health issues and educational and behavioral problems in modern society and influence people to make healthy lifestyle choices and meaningful life decisions. However, most often, I find this term overused, misused, confused, and even utterly commercialized.
For example, gurus, meditation teachers, mystics, yogic masters, and preachers package their spiritual techniques and craft their presence in such a way that their spiritual teaching resonates as informative, entertaining, alluring, and incentivized for a specific age group, gender, generation, profession, and for people with a specific way of life, attitude, and purchasing power. And these days, spirituality is no longer something that can be obtained without generous contributions; most of the spiritual reliefs available on the market have a price tag stitched around them.
Our familiar assumptions also limit our understanding of spirituality to becoming members of a spiritual sect, listening to spiritual teachers, following their instructions, and reading spiritual books regularly. But to become spiritual, one does not have to join an esoteric cult, put on religious markers, receive the spiritual energy transmission of a guru and his grace, or uncritically digest his outrageous teaching.
Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, observed that, based on our infantile experiences, it is part of human psychology to yearn for a father figure who can guide us through this chaotic, unpredictable, and confusing world. And there are different gurus, mystics, evangelists, and spiritual masters in the spiritual market ready to take up this role as father figures because, as humans, we want to live a meaningful life, find answers to the questions about our being and suffering, and overcome the fear of death. Besides, all of us also have that feeling of being unsatisfied by material comforts, things, and achievements.
As a spiritual person, I am not opposed to anyone following any spiritual teacher; however, as a follower, you must be critical enough to question their self-contradictory and baseless statements, and also, under the guise of spiritual growth, you shouldn’t be exploited, made vulnerable, or demanded to make irrational commitments and actions. We also need to realize that nobody in this world has a truth that doesn’t need to be proved. I have met hundreds of spiritual teachers from different religious traditions, but I never forgot to keep my critical mind open. After all, the word ""spiritual"" comes from a Latin word meaning ""to breathe freely."" As a result, becoming a free spirit—those who dare to challenge traditional beliefs, let go, and celebrate their liberation—is also a part of human spirituality.
As human existence is divided into mind and matter, we need abstract and soulful substances like poetry, ideas, music, art, literature, philosophy, self-inquiry, and reflections to help us find meaning and significance in our outer actions, associations, objectives, and outcomes from our inner perspectives. In other words, to live a meaningful life, we need to find something—music, art, poetry, meditation, philosophy, or writing—that allows us to explore and engage with the outside world while maintaining our inner sense of balance, detachment, calmness, maturity, and acceptance. Hence, spirituality is a search for an equilibrium point that balances our inner and outer lives.
Spirituality awakens to a living reality that is self-sufficient in itself, and nothing can be more spiritual than living in the world, where you find events, occasions, situations, relationships, explorations, and experiences that can take you out of yourself and connect you with everyone and everything around you. We can also recognize our relative insignificance in the universe when we temporarily dissolve our egos. Similarly, spirituality urges us to embrace, adjust to, and enjoy all the recklessness and paradoxes of human life. There are contractions and confusions everywhere, but these paradoxes also make life deep, dynamic, vibrant, improbable, creative, and exciting.
Surely, life is unfair and unpredictable, and as human beings, we have to deal with lots of people, events, occurrences, and outcomes that we don't like. As everything ends, every moment of life we live, touch, love, reflect on, listen to, connect with, and experience is special, specific, unrepeatable, and unparalleled. Hence, the journey of life becomes more spiritually meaningful than its presumed destinations. This is the only life we have; therefore, everything we do, discover, relate to, and create becomes significant and valuable because we will never have another opportunity to relive and restore those fleeting moments of life. After all, nothing can be more spiritual than to breathe in a world already overflowing with life, rhythm, a sense of wonder, beauty, and mystery.
With intensity, depth of engagement, thoughtfulness, and passion, everything from meditation, yoga, and dance to driving, climbing mountains, having conversations, and having a cup of tea becomes a meaning-making process that is also spiritually enriching. Human spirituality is not something separate from our everyday lives. For example, by reading Chekhov, walking around in the woods, writing poetry, teaching, gazing at the stars, playing with my daughter, and learning the guitar, I am able to engage in a meaning-making process and also feel the connectedness of my being with other beings and nature. And there are numerous other ways to celebrate our spirituality in the midst of our daily activities and practices. Hence, spirituality is not the exclusive property of people with certain levels of spiritual awakening, and we do not need their blessings to become spiritual.
More importantly, there is no need to elevate specific spiritual practices and religious rituals above any other ordinary human activities. With a little forethought, emotion engagement, love, passion, depth in involvement, and awareness in every ounce of our fleeting human existence, we can spiritualize our individual lives.

110,blog,https://en.setopati.com/blog/160442,"In the age of consumerism, we as individuals are forming our mindsets and behaviors based on what we have learned from different advertisements, social media contents, blog posts, expert opinions, TikTok, celebrity endorsements on Instagram, TV reality shows, the latest viral trends and contents, product positioning, celebrity lifestyles, movies, and so on.
As a result, we are influenced by the suggestions, persuasions, and symbolic meaning we have derived from these sources and develop our taste, preferences, decisions, comparisons, and lifestyle choices accordingly.
Similarly, we also learn so much about loving relationships from the narratives of love symbolized in movies and songs. Likewise, we like to read guidebooks on the art of loving to enhance our love, replicate the love lives of different social media influencers, and make love decisions based on consumer values of use and disposal. When it comes to choosing gifts for your girlfriend, you also seek expert advice and adhere to their guidelines in order to provide her with the ultimate experience of your love.
Just to give an example of this learning because of the influence of pop songs these days, for modern lovers, breakup has simply become a natural or obvious stage of the love cycle,  comparable to any other product life cycle where, after peak experiences of love, there will be decline and discontinuity.
Being in love also becomes useless when excitement begins to weaken and the boredom of repetition starts to creep in, and at that moment, you can ""shake it off,"" as Taylor Swift reminded us; indeed, if you can't make him stay, you can at least shake him off. Breakups aren't tragic, brokenhearted, or sad. Don't waste your emotions grieving over him; save your emotions for someone else you'll find again. Now you are better off being apart than together, as “The Breakup Song” lyrics from ""Ae Dil Hai Mushkil"" remind us, and breakups have become just another reason to reignite your passion, take charge of your life again, and party with friends rather than hang on and grieve over a stale relationship.
Likewise, we feel that exchanging various products developed as gifts and engaging in modern-day love rituals would prolong, strengthen, and enrich our loving relationships. Modern-day love rituals like Rose, Chocolate, and Teddy Days, candlelight dinners, Valentine's Day gift packages, and diamond rings and bracelets make so much sense in consumer culture because the products and services that are available in the market can be used to signify and express a person's quantum of love.
Love has surely become costly. With so many products and services in the consumer market that symbolize and signify different features, dimensions, depths, and expressions of love, lovers need to have sufficient purchasing power to exchange, enjoy, and experience love in all its colors, exuberance, and facets.
From restaurants, vacations, shopping, birthday celebrations, night outs, romantic dates, and weekly gifts to movie theaters, different portions of love hang everywhere, and you need to purchase them to enrich your loving relationships. Indeed, you can consume these products and services with your partner in order to enhance your experience of being in love and make it more satisfying and exciting.
Falling in love in the age of consumerism becomes so irrelevant, less exciting, dull, and meaningless if you can't buy your portion of love.
As a result, much of human love and relationship in this consumer age is nurtured by an individual's consuming capacity and purchasing power rather than genuine passion, sacrifice, a sense of togetherness, trust, support, and tolerance for each other. We have started to view people as commodities that can be exchanged, consumed, and disposed of.
Moreover, falling in love has become some kind of window shopping where we look for different categories of image, expectation, satisfaction, and anticipation in someone to fall in love with, just like we go through a catalog to find a suitable product with essential features, functions, qualities, possibilities, and consumer benefits. As with other products, if it serves our purpose, our relationship will last for years; otherwise, it will be dumped and replaced if it fails to meet our expectations.
Besides, based on our consumer mindset, we think that we can easily dump a person and find a replacement rather than engage in the difficult tasks of acceptance, accommodations, and conflict resolution. After all, a loving relationship is interchangeable from the standpoint of a consumer; thus, like any rational consumer, we are free to dispose of the other person when we are confident enough to realize that we can now possess an upgraded model than what we currently have.
In the age of consumerism, our ways of loving and being in relationships also resemble how we would interact with and react to any other consumer product available on the market. Loving someone is just a part of consumer behavior.
Just as consumers have learned to seek temporary satisfaction—something attractive that immediately makes us happy for a moment—we all have become collectors of transient moments in love. Lovers may post their pictures or reveal their intimate confessions of love to the public in a manner of showing off, but lovers always feel insecure about being disposed of, dropped, or interchanged. And like our affection for any other consumer product, after a while, love also fades away.
Loving relationships have indeed become liquid."
111,blog,https://en.setopati.com/blog/160441,"Patan is a historical city situated in Lalitpur District of Nepal, inhabited by the people of Newar community. A remarkable characteristic of this city is its portrayal of religious harmony between Hindus and Buddhists in every aspect of the community. Being born and raised here, I got more and more interested in the city when I started doing my graduate studies in Urban Planning, and the insights have been truly fulfilling.
Sustainable cities are the pressing need of modern times. City planners use tactics such as zoning, open space allocation, walkability, urban growth boundaries, satellite cities and many more to achieve this, but the way in which the then planners of Patan achieved this is truly worth learning.
Let me take you through Patan in the 17th century. To start with, “Astamatrika”, the eight mother goddesses, and “Dashamahavidya”, the 10 goddesses, were established to set the boundary for urban expansion. The faith in these places of worship was such that people did not go beyond the perimeter set by the goddesses. This protected the lower fertile agricultural land, while the higher ground was used for settlement. So the perimeter boundary directed the development to be compact, and thus walkable. However, though there was compactness, there were ample urban open spaces and lung spaces (green spaces). Urban open spaces named “Lachi”, “Nani”, “Bahal” & “Bahi” were preserved and each was tied with its respective religious belief system (Hinduism or Buddhism), such that no one encroached upon it (unlike our open spaces!). For lung spaces named “khyo”, different festivals and socio-cultural events were planned such that the space would be in constant care. Also, open spaces of ecological importance were tied with various rituals too. The planners then had the vision and the creative methods to protect these open spaces.

Moving further into the city, the form of residential quarters shows the importance given to communal living. The houses are clustered around an inner courtyard, giving room for private spaces inside houses, while ensuring access to a larger public space for everyone. This model with slight deviations is becoming popular with Western developers too.

Newa Chen, a 17th-century building, renovated in 2006 with help from UNESCO

In the case of zoning, it was “zoning by jaat” or “zoning by profession”. Though the concept of “jaat” led to social discrimination, in those days it was primarily used to create “homogeneous communities by occupation” to create agglomeration and economies of scale. With all this in place, when the population still exceeded a certain limit, a satellite town was established with linkages to the main town, to curb the effects of overpopulation.
So this begs the question, how was this extraordinary feat made possible? Certainly, the planners were quite creative and the tool they used was ritual mediation. The meanings given by the people to these rituals had bound the people. They put tremendous faith in rituals and religion. But now, as with every historic city, Patan is going through the process of degeneration. At times the rituals can be seen to be performed only for the sake of rituals, without paying enough attention to the deeper purpose of sustainability, which they hoped to achieve. This situation has brought forth a new set of challenges, which calls for maximum creative efforts by planners to establish newer meanings. An example could be, the lung spaces mentioned earlier being protected through socio-cultural events might be adjusted by giving access to schools for their events in culture and sports, in case the previous ties grow weaker.
History serves as a record of experiences and learning, but not as a rule book. It is up to us to learn from the experiences of the past, and come up with creative solutions to tackle the challenges of the present and future.
May the planners of the future write as highly of us as we write about the planners of the past."
112,blog,https://en.setopati.com/blog/160199,"In a very odd manner, every possible world tends to exist in ways that are not entirely physical. A world that could be described in words but is devoid of any space-time convergence. Our dreams, for example, don't have any physical run-down. They just appear real to the dreamer and yet leave in a wisp when they are over. The dreamer then is left with the memory of the world that never gets to come alive, the world of zero substance, and the world whose absence is the very reason that gives meaning to the world that gets to live forward.
The nonappearance of every possible version of our other realities makes it possible for this reality to emanate into the physical world that matters to us the most. This is where we find ourselves. This is the one that has its claim on us. Think about the person you didn’t marry, the child that wasn’t born to you, the winter that failed to bring the snow and the friendship that couldn’t find its morning in the dew of little things and didn’t get refreshed.
In that sense, all that didn’t happen in a life is the very life blood of what did happen in a very bizarre and asymmetrical manner. The relationship between those two worlds is just the fringe line that makes those two worlds mutually coeval. Not just the one that claims me but also the one that I am absent from. 
This is the world that I ponder about all the time. This is also where I find myself present in my absence. 
Those two roads that diverged in the woods and the one Robert Frost didn’t take, 
What happened to that road? 
Did it wither away? 
Or did it somehow become a critical part of the one that was taken? Frost’s grievance about the road not taken makes one wonder what the real loss to him was. 
The road that he didn’t take is as necessary as the one he did take. 
For if it were not for the one untaken, the taken would lose its significance. 
However, unlike Robert Frost, there are moments in life where two roads don’t always diverge into the yellow wood. In fact, I only see one road ahead of me. And this one doesn’t lead to the yellow wood. Instead, it leads to this huge strip of a green hill. In the midst of that hill, there’s a big oak tree. Under it, I see a man waiting for something, or perhaps someone. I don’t know.
So, I hesitate for a moment, but then I move toward him to get closer.
The story of his life is the story of anyone’s life. He has had his share of life’s ups and downs in this world that claims him in all its hue and tinge. The man’s loss of his love, his aspirations, his honor, his will, and all that makes him the hero of his device, all that is taken away. 
This is the man who doesn’t look straight at me. I cannot clearly see him.
His voice grooved and barely audible, as if he is telling the story of his life to himself. My presence doesn't seem to bother him. He is speaking very softly, and he is speaking of the life he missed to be a part of. This life, the one under the oak, isn’t his for him. He is a stranger here.
The life, he thinks, belongs to him is in the negative space. It is the space that can only be imagined or dreamed of. This is where he finds his completions. 
His love, his honor, his aspirations, and everything that makes him a whole, it happens in this imagined space.
This is his home, the one built on his absences.
Nonetheless, he seems not to understand that both these worlds, the one under the oak tree and the one away from it are his to claim.
One subdued in the background while the other bulged out into physical space. 
Both these two realms are necessary for this forlorn man to become a whole.
Take away one and the other ceases to live. 
I look at him again, and this time, he looks right back at me.
The man slowly moves as if to talk to me. He leans forward.
Now, I see his face in my deepest awe. I know this man! 
This is the man from that hill. The man from under the oak tree.
I recognize him now. This man is me. 
I am the man under that oak tree."
113,blog,https://en.setopati.com/blog/160166,"I can understand when philosopher Slavoj Zizek sees happiness as unethical. For many of us happiness seekers, his assertion may sound rather surprising. However, I think Zizek is right with his claim, if our appetite for maximizing our happiness now impacts ecological collapse, puts the existence of future generations on this planet at a greater risk and also compromises the ability of the future generations to meet their needs without strife and needless sufferings. Besides, in an age of hyperconsumerism, we have placed our habits of happiness on a shallow myth that we can’t be happy without having. And, we have mindlessly decided to overlook the bitter truth that many of our happiness choices are detrimental to the ecology and sustainability. Similarly, our search for happiness can be unethical if we stifle and undermine the happiness of others for our selfish fulfillments. We see this in our family life, where most parents add needless sorrows in the lives of their children for not keeping up with their choices, expectations and preferences.
My own search for happiness reminds me that the road I am traveling on is full of potholes. And, by traveling on this bumpy road, I have realized that happiness always appears in our life in unusual shapes, sounds and sizes. Hence, there are little puddles of humor, fun, playfulness and joys everywhere. Moreover, in my search for happiness, I have unearthed some essential ingredients for a happy life.
To live a happy life, firstly, we need to respect and admire others for their unique ways of being in the world. Some like to make noise, others crave silence, and some like to be in front and others like to shout from the back. Hence, rather than comparing people, we need to admire people for who they are, what they have been through and how they like to engage with other people. With this respect we can both increase and improve our human relationships, the way we relate to each other, which is essential for a happy life.
The next ingredient for a happy life is that we need to have enough courage so that we can avoid becoming a chasing shadow of other people’s expectations, projections and desires. Without courage, our life would be nothing more than a tedious circle of compulsions and compromises. And, it also takes enormous courage to be satisfied with who we are and what we have right now.
Finally, so much of our happiness depends on our ability to let go of our sense of control. In a world of imperfections, how our life unfolds and how people decide to act and react with us are beyond our absolute control. Hence, rather than holding onto the ropes of our expectations tightly, we need to let go and enjoy what remains of it, the experience of life, with all its random surprises - and that’s what happiness is.
Sources of Happiness
The most important source of happiness in our life is not what we have with us or what we want to have sooner or later, rather, streams of happiness begin to sprout in our life abundantly when we begin to realize that our human life is indeed little and we can’t go on postponing our happiness by attaching it to some event, situation or to an achievement that we may never encounter in our short life. None of us have a written script of our life with us and as we strive toward our dreams and possibilities, often the drama of life turns out the way we never suspected.
And, to find happiness in those messy and confusing moments of our life we need to recognize that patterns of human life are unwritten, uncalled for and unpredictable. Even with our utmost preparedness none of us can systematically dictate the course of our life with our own will. Therefore, in order to live a happy life we need to replace the concept of happiness as a destination with the concept of happiness as a process. After all, so much of the happiness we experience in our life depends on how we react to what is happening in and around us.
Most of us are unhappy because we think of happiness in terms of when or how we are going to be happy. Whereas we can create happiness even in difficult situations of our life by remaining resolute in our inner conviction that with whatever we have we can always recreate our life once again. Besides, when we have nothing else to do, even counting what we already have also makes us happy. Despite having many things, many of us are miserable with a single thought of why we don’t have with us what the rest of the world already has.
Having is not enough; happiness happens when we do something that makes us feel worthwhile, energetic, focused, connected, purposeful and engaged. For example, we can learn new stuff, develop new habits, cultivate new friends, make life easy for ourselves, let go of expectations that pull us down and sometimes take a step back to see things anew. Moreover, life is not fair and all of us don’t need equal things to be equally happy. Our struggles also give us a sense of happiness when we realize that we are maturing as a human being climbing new heights.
Finally, I feel that the most precious source of happiness is always cheap, ordinary, plentiful, spontaneous and free. Just the other day, I was witnessing clouds in the sky, which seemed like building tiny steps into eternity, and these clouds floating in the sky made me feel relaxed and fulfilled for a while. I know there is nothing special about clouds playing in the sky. However, all we get in life are the moments to become happy and it depends on how we add these moments  to our experiences and make our life a satisfying journey.
Happiness: A Journey
Whenever I ponder over my quest for a flourishing life, I take the words of poet T.S. Elliot rather seriously as he has written somewhere in one of his poems that, we shall not cease from exploration/and the end of all our exploring/we will arrive where we started and know the place for the first time. In essence, our search for happiness begins with oneself and culminates within oneself. However, in a world of constant distractions, denials, self-deceptions and delusions, for most of us it is rather discomforting to be at ease, comfort or at peace with oneself.
After witnessing and experiencing various ups and downs in our life and facing up to all the troubles and sorrows that life throws at us from time to time, our search for happiness turns full circle when we realize that the ultimate joy in our life begins to overflow profoundly when we become true to ourselves standing before the mirror of our life, embracing its true reflections and finding freedom within our self. But, the paradox here is that only those who know how to spread out their self find happiness within them. Hence, in our search for happiness we also realize that happiness is not something we experience in isolation and that we derive most of our happiness by connecting with people around us.
Moreover, the journey of life takes its own turn and we also need to adopt, adjust and add a sense of growth and maturity with our age as various phases of our life have their own peculiar sources of joy for us to rediscover. Here, for many people their search for happiness becomes delusional, self-destructive and indulgent, when they fail to comprehend this reality of human life. Hence, to experience happiness at different junctures, we need to rephrase and reshape our dreams, hopes, wishes, relationships and expectations, adopting the emerging realities of our life. Besides, as long as we are pursuing happiness, our search becomes like running about from one circle to another trying to find something that exists like a mirage appearing in the dry wilderness; it appears at once and escapes in another moment. And, while journeying on rough and tough roads of our life in search of happiness, often we need to take a pause and shift our mind from the loops of desiring and expecting to life itself where everything is alive and happening.
Lastly, rather than finding, happiness is just about letting go and losing oneself in the moment with whatever ordinary we have, a piece of music, art, dance, reflection, love, friendship, conversation, meditation , sex, fun or poetry. After all, happiness is always with us, it simply needs a bit of inner tuning and with our sense of ease, acceptance and comfort within oneself, we can catch its vibrations all around us echoing.

114,blog,https://en.setopati.com/blog/159758,"Rabindra Mishra’s new alliance with the Rashtriya Prajatantra Party, virtually a political arm of the former king, has hogged much of the limelight in recent days. The comfort with which he has gelled with his new companions indicates that Mishra is much more at ease under the former king’s patronage than he ever was during his brief, if half-hearted, stint as a republican with the Bibeksheel Sajha Party. The palpable ease with which he has hugged the institution of monarchy shows that he has finally sloughed off his outer skin and has decided to openly and unequivocally put the money where his mouth is. In deciding to abandon his previous niceties–both in his ideology as well as his speech–Mishra has replaced his finger wagging schoolmarmish style, with a metaphorical sledge-hammer and has decided to wield it against the nascent democracy questioning its very foundations.
It is no wonder that Mishra has tapped into a powerful mix of grievances and resentment of the old guard, those who typically were the beneficiaries of–and did well under–the former king’s and his predecessor’s patronage. If the “likes” and “retweets” on Twitter are any indication, even those who claim to be a “Global Citizen from Gulmi” seem to be tacitly endorsing a patently parochial view based on medieval superstitions.
That a child born in a certain family inherently holds a superior position to the rest of us and accordingly has an in-born right to rule as an “enlightened guardian”–something that Mishra is advocating for–is a notion that would invoke laughter and ridicule if it was not so dangerous and foolish.
Now, to his credit, I think Mishra is indirectly and unwittingly serving democracy by holding the banner of opposition against, among other things, the cronyism and kleptocracy of our current leaders. The current crop of leaders are indeed undermining Nepal’s fledgling democracy by their own incompetence and widespread grift. Our democratic institutions, unfortunately, have not matured enough to curb the excesses of our leaders and a sensible conservatism, I believe, does have an important role to play in the current political climate.
However, by advocating for the resurrection of a dated institution that has been the provenance of bigotry, arbitrary hierarchy, and authoritarian policies in the past, Mishra is doing nothing more than expressing his frustration against the radical leveling of human dignity that has followed the Maoist Revolution in Nepal.
For all its chaos and cravenness, there is no denying that the Maoist revolution initiated an era of modernity that valued the minorities and indigenous people as human beings with their own individuality and human dignity, something that was denied to them for centuries under the structural discriminations created and sustained under various monarchical regimes.
Mishra’s belief that a “soft dictator” should always hover over the heads of Nepali people–ready to unleash the punitive power of the state at its will–not only belies ignorance of human psychology and its cravings for unlimited power, but, more importantly, is indicative of a limited historical understanding of how democracy functions and delivers.
Democracy, though a rule of the majority, ensures fundamental freedoms and protects the rights of the minorities. It is an inherently messy system which by default favors wheeling and dealing among various political actors instead of dealing in quick fixes along clean and defined lines. Unfortunately the bad tags along with the good in a democracy, and it is one of the vital duties of a politician to see that the good comes out on top. However, men are not angels and therefore democracy requires institutional maturity and independence to hold the political actors accountable whenever they cross the legal and normative boundaries. And those boundaries are set not only by courts and government agencies but also by the society at large. An intelligent politician more attuned to the aspirations of modern times would try to align our Byzantine institutions–the actual root of our current problem–with the promises enshrined in our current Constitution, however lacking those may be. It is no doubt easier said than done; however, a great leader knows that not everything can be achieved in one’s lifetime. A good leader knows that our present should not define our future because politics at heart is about what ought to be rather than what is.
Instead Mishra has decided to provoke the latent elements in our society that are atavistic, backward, and superstitious. By surrendering his conscience at the altar of His Highness, Mishra, I believe, is doing a disservice to the ideology of conservatism itself. In his interviews he regularly waxes nostalgic about what we have lost as a culture and community, but rarely does he acknowledge what we have gained as a nation. The laundry list of his complaints are long and consist mainly of the natural consequences that result when a society long held on a chokehold of arbitrary power breaks free. The Nepali people have freed themselves from an arbitrary power that could snatch our freedom at will. We have laid the groundwork for a positive, scientific, and a forward looking country where the minorities and the indigenous have an equal ownership in the nation. It would be a significant backward step to take that away from the people and hand it over to a hereditary power that could potentially pull the plug on our democracy on its whim. Are we really up for that?"
115,blog,https://en.setopati.com/blog/159641,"What does the future of humanity look like? Machine learning and artificial intelligence are pushing all kinds of business, innovation, research and other areas to a whole new level, especially in developed countries. The time has come for Nepal to embrace the power of machine learning and artificial intelligence to tackle the difficult problems that the country has faced for centuries. Natural disasters, precision agriculture, managing road traffic, environmental sustainability are the perfect candidates for the next technological revolutions.
As a middle school student in America, I have had the privilege of learning programming and machine learning along with theoretical foundations from experts in the field. I invite the girls of Nepal to join me in learning the foundations of data science and machine learning so that we not only help the country to grow with a future army of machine learning experts, but also smooth out the wrinkles of the gender gap in Nepal. It is obvious that one of the most significant steps toward breaking the gender barrier is through empowering girls. Let's make it happen!
Your future is powered by code; if you want to build for the future, you'll need to learn how to code. Here, I propose an innovative idea about the most sophisticated tool that is transforming the world right now. I invite the girls of Nepal to join me in learning how to code for predictive analytics and machine learning. My purpose for this call is twofold: first, to contribute to reducing the gender gap, and second, to have fun teaching coding and machine learning.
Coding, or computer programming, is a vital tool in science, engineering, business and many other fields that will help you tremendously in achieving your goals. Coding is the language of machine learning and predictive analytics. The developed countries of the world are undergoing a major transformation in their economies thanks to the very powerful algorithms of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). But how does it work?
Machine learning is a futuristic idea that has been in the making for quite some time now. It is a set of algorithms that predicts patterns and data on a large scale. Machines are learning how to process vast amounts of data in order to improve our lives in ways we can't even fathom. Machine learning is a set of computer algorithms that learn how to make predictions based on the information provided. With human intelligence, it is difficult to make predictions with datasets that are too large, complex, or vast. In contrast, machines will be able to take the data and make the predictions that humans cannot.
Take an example of AlphaGo with which began the global sensation of AI. Designed in 2015, AlphaGo, an AI with unimaginable power, won against the best of the best in the game of Go. The best part is, the designer of AlphaGo has no clue how to play the game.
Whereas AlphaGo is an example of a full-blown powerful AI, what I am proposing here is the route to becoming a specialist in various types of predictive analytics and machine learning. Conventionally, AI has been treated as a broad spectrum of techniques that solve a computational task. This can theoretically include many techniques, many of them being not-so-great historically. Machine learning is a suite of powerful statistical models and algorithms that have developed dramatically in these last few decades. These days, when the media talks about AI, they usually refer to a specific version of the ML models called deep learning or its variants.
Machine learning is a remarkable set of technologies that can be used for a wide variety of applications. One of the algorithms I’ve written is 97% accurate in detecting breast cancer. For this, I used a database of over 11,000 medical records published online. The model I wrote learns to distinguish a case of breast cancer from a healthy breast by comparing many characteristics of breasts afflicted with cancer versus the ones without. Machine learning is the foundation of the future of healthcare. Experts believe that half of the medical discoveries and innovations will come from machine learning in a decade, as opposed to the current heavy reliance on hard-core scientific research as of now.
Machine learning algorithms are used for many kinds of applications such as in healthcare, email filtering, speech recognition, computer vision, search engine queries, and many more. The question is, can we create an army of ML experts in Nepal and make a dent in the gender gap with the proper training and mindset?
Machine learning, specifically AI driven by the architecture of deep learning model, is transforming the industries of the developed world. Whereas all these achievements sound far-fetched, especially in a developing country like Nepal, they were all achieved with the application of powerful algorithms. For that, all you need is a passion to learn how to code and to learn the theory. I am myself learning machine learning, and have already been able to use some of the machine learning models I have programmed in various predictions. It gives me pleasure when I can teach what I have learnt and help reduce the gender gap at the same time. If you are curious about coding, data engineering and machine learning, join me online in gaining this new knowledge.
In this programming and machine learning course, I will walk you through the basics of programming. This foundational material about scripting is the first step in programming of any type of analytics. And this is going to enrich you with a whole new suite of scripts to perform many essential tasks in analytics. The skills in foundational programming will also come handy when you want to solve many kinds of real-world problems. For example, I like to program and solve problems that come up in college-level probability courses. I am able to do this via programming even when I don’t understand the math.
I have created a few articles showing several of these problems, their code, and solutions. For example, roll several dice at the same time and if you observe the same number in more than one dice repeatedly, those outcomes can be simulated with the code I published here. In another article here, I show how the chances of two students in a group of 25 having the birthday on the same day are actually pretty high. I have also published my code here to find the probabilities of various kinds of card games. In addition, I simulated the famed Monty Hall Problem to solve the puzzling question as to which choice would help you win the game. The simulation of the situation [available at my GitHub] revealed that the answer was not what I had thought.
Whereas you can do many types of problem-solving with the basics of programming like I showed above, the main goal of this first course is to get ready for machine learning. Once the basics of programming are completed, I will walk you through several models of machine learning. If you are interested, sign up today for this free course. All you need is a computer, and the desire to learn!

116,blog,https://en.setopati.com/blog/159327,"I come from the Chepang community, one of the most backward communities in Nepal and categorized as a highly marginalized community by the National Federation for Development of Indigenous Nationalities (NFDIN). As I belong to and grew up in this community, it motivated me to write a reflective piece on the contributions of education and the bottlenecks for the Chepang community in the current educational pedagogy in Nepal.
The Chepang community falls behind in different socioeconomic indicators such as literacy and access to health and basic infrastructure, as well as in different socioeconomic categorizations. Despite support from several NGOs, INGOs and constant support from the government, the Chepang community continues to remain in a dire situation. There were several non-formal education programs conducted by NGOs which have enabled target groups to become aware so that they can help themselves. Despite the continuous flow of aid, however, the desired socio-economic transformation has not been seen in the Chepang community. This gives ample supporting statement on why there has been less development in the Chepang community. Literacy rate is still low, most of them still live below the poverty line, and they are far behind in the human development index and similar indicators. There are indigenous communities who made a leap in income-generating activities, adult literacy programs, and other development activities. Chepang people, however, still lag behind on all fronts.
Every year thousands of students complete SEE, higher secondary education or bachelor’s degree out of whom few are from the Chepang community. Despite structural and historical disadvantages, a few Chepangs excel in their academic career. Even after Chepangs are able to complete their education in spite of several hardships, they need to compete with others for Public Service Commission, non-governmental, skills-based and other jobs. Those who are able to receive good schooling are at least exposed to multiple facilities including access to computer learning, libraries and sports, and so might have enriched their general knowledge and have a competitive advantage when applying for jobs. But the ones like students from the Chepang community who mostly complete school from a place where there are limited facilities, exposure and training, find it difficult to compete with the batch of students with whom they pass SEE or high school together. Lack of basic computer skills, training and exposure puts them at a disadvantage in the application process. However, there are a few exceptions where a student who completed schooling from a remote part of the country competed and excelled in many aspects. This gives ample space to reflect on what is holding the Chepang community back – whether it is the current pedagogy or the incompetency within students from the Chepang community.

Education as a means to reproduce inequality for Chepang community
It is clearly seen in Nepal that those who can afford expensive tuition fees, mostly those from economically well-off backgrounds, tend to send their children to private schools, colleges and universities because they think that expensive schools provide quality education.
When selecting schools and colleges for their children, parents with fat wallets in Nepal take into account the infrastructure of the institution, well-decorated classrooms, transportation, computer labs, swimming pools, basketball courts, football grounds and other facilities. These parents believe that quality education is provided by such schools with proper infrastructure and other facilities. Although it might be a subjective measurement for quality education as indicators, this will make a substantial impact on what students will learn in what environment. Though these may not be good indicators for measurement, what students will learn and how they will learn will certainly make an impact on the overall learning process. And yes, it is certain that students from better economic backgrounds can afford private tutors and attend private schools. Several studies have also found out the positive relations between students’ economic backgrounds and their test scores. These components contribute to differential academic performance in schools which is directly related to the income of a student’s family.
The Chepangs, most of whom come from a poor and downtrodden socioeconomic background, cannot generally attend expensive schools unless they are provided scholarships, subsidies and other benefits. So, students from affluent families go to well-off schools while those from poor economic background attend economic schools. These are the initial indicators for students leading to learning disparities that reinforce social inequality. These substantiate that schools provide competitive learning environments to advantaged children compared to disadvantaged children where schools reproduce or exacerbate some inequalities.
To illustrate with a real-life example, I asked my sister Simran Praja (name changed) who is waiting for her grade 12 results. She is not familiar with what a CV or resume is. She also does not have computer knowledge and skills which are a prerequisite in today’s job market. Basic email communication, searching for jobs, applying for jobs and getting shortlisted is a tall order. There are only a handful of Chepang representatives in government services. Hence, preparing for Public Service Commission jobs is also a difficult task although it’s not impossible.
Hence, these real-life examples clearly show the challenges faced by Chepang students even after they manage to complete basic schooling, high school and even university education. The quality of education that Chepang students are getting is leading them nowhere. A research on Chepangs in 2011 found out that Chepangs had more access to education than before, but the quality of education that Chepang students were receiving was below average. Though a growing number of students were enrolled in schools, children were now just going through the rituals of schooling rather than learning and preparing for their secure future.

Educational journey stymies Chepang’s development
Reflecting on my personal experience of growing up in a Chepang community where there is material deprivation, lack of fulfillment of basic needs and other necessities further deprives the Chepang students of a learning environment. Several studies claim that material deprivation also leads to low educational achievement in schools as students coming from low economic strata tend to lack education materials, environment and parental guidance throughout. To illustrate with an example, poverty plays a crucial role in Chepang children dropping out of school. Some may not be able to afford an education while some drop out in the middle due to household responsibilities. To support the claim one study states that cultural factors play a significant role in Chepang girls dropping out of school as Chepang people expect girls to help their families with household chores, leaving many girls at home during the harvest season and festivals when their families need their help. The author claims that many girls do not attend classes on a regular basis because of household duties such as cutting grass for animals, cooking food, cleaning and taking care of younger siblings.
Even during the recent COVID crisis in Nepal, several students from poor economic backgrounds could not afford to purchase phones and internet data packs which hampered their class attendance. As a result, they could not attend online classes in schools, ultimately leading to many school dropouts in the last two years. Most of the school-going children from the Chepang community had to discontinue their education during the pandemic for lack of internet access, technology and devices, resulting in a large number of dropouts.
These reflections and arguments are also backed up by contributions in sociology by scholars such as Luis Althusur, Downey and Condron who claim that education acts as a means for reproduction of ruling class ideology where dominant class ideology is taught. The scholarly claims that schools act as engines of inequality dominate contemporary sociology of education even though schools play little role in generating achievement gaps. These educational institutions act as a social sorting machine, creating categories that serve as the foundation of later life inequalities. These categories contribute to production of inequalities within schools and beyond.
Way forward for Chepangs: Technical education as a ray of hope
Development agencies still tend to impose their own agenda rather than fulfilling the requirements of Chepangs. Some of the common instances are awareness activities such as financial frugality, use of contraceptives, use of pit latrine, growing cash crops, forming mothers groups, training on tailoring, youth clubs, and ability to sign one’s name. Where is the indigenous knowledge and the prior knowledge that the Chepang community possesses? Why did income-based learning not become a priority for this vulnerable and poor community? Technical and vocational education is gradually gaining popularity in the Chepang community. Technical certified jobs like staff nurse, overseer, electrician, plumber, health assistant are now becoming a way forward for the Chepang community. There are growing numbers of staff nurses who are already in local level health posts on government contracts. These small steps also play a key role in helping the Chepang community support their families, siblings in accessing education and other opportunities.
As most of the Chepang people are below the poverty line, the government needs to give priority to creating more employment opportunities so that everyone can get work. Given that a majority of youths from the community are less educated and have dropped out halfway through school, the country needs to train and mobilize them in the development process. Productivity-focused training skills, recognizing prior learning of Chepangs should be imparted with inclusive targeting to the Chepang community which can provide access to work. This entire process not only helps the country’s economy to grow but also enables the Chepang youths to earn their livelihoods.

117,blog,https://en.setopati.com/blog/158833,"As I sit by my ailing father, I have an impression of him representing an era of slowly vanishing Limbu culture and tradition of Mundhum-based rites and rituals.
I still vividly remember how vehemently he performed the ritual of Tongsing Takma as a Yeba (Limbu shaman assigned for carrying out various rituals) some decades ago. In the night of the ritual performance, he would wear long white robe tightened at the waist, a headdress decorated with the feathers of different birds and garlands made from the beads of rudraksha. For the whole night, he would recite Mundhum and dance around the bamboo pole known as Yagesing fixed for the ritual in the middle of the courtyard. As a boy, I could hardly grasp the eloquence of his Mundhum recitation and message of those rich oral scriptures. For me, the event was simply an occasion of celebration and fun where I enjoyed ludicrously following and copying his dancing steps and panicked and thrilled being chased by him in the middle of the ritual performance along with others.
Back then, Limbu community operated differently. They observed their own distinct life rituals including Tongsing Takma. The night of Tongsing Takma was not only an event for ritual performance but it was also a social gathering for the entire villagers. Some of them would come to join hands for the different responsibilities including feeding Tongba (millet beer served in a wooden barrel shaped vessel) and other local liquor to the visitors while others would come to know their fortune from the words of the Yeba, my father. Others joined the Yeba and his Yagapsiba (assistant of the Yeba) in the ritual dance carrying and beating brass plates. For majority of villagers, it was a pure form of an entertainment free of invitation. Everyone was welcomed in the night of the Tongsing Takma ritual.
The decade of 1990 ushered prodigious changes in Nepali politics as well as in sociocultural realms. The Janaandolan of 1990 saw an end of absolute monarchy replaced by constitutional monarchy and multiparty system ending three decades of party-less Panchayat system imposed by King Mahendra in 1960. The same decade also worked as a harbinger for the country embracing neoliberal ideals as the panacea for socio-economical transformation. Nobody thought of far-reaching implications of the incipient systems to the local language, culture, knowledge system and social structures of the indigenous people.
Same applied to the Limbu people, chiefly inhabiting the eastern part of Nepal.  In addition to joining British and Indian armies as Lahure, many Limbu youths followed the footsteps of other Nepali migrant workers making destinations mainly to Malaysia and the Gulf Cooperative Council countries including Qatar, Saudi Arabia, UAE and Kuwait among others. As foreign employment became a major source of income for many a Nepali households in the last three decades, it further provided an impetus for people to migrate from the hills and mountains to the plain regions of Tarai and from rural villages to city and towns, thus bringing unprecedented changes in rubrics of society and culture.
Such migration trends not only resulted in the shortage of working age people in the villages but also brought changes in demographic and economic structures of towns and countryside leaving the family members of migrant workers increasingly dependent on the remittance they send from abroad. Accordingly, people fell under the charm of consumerism ultimately debilitating the bonds of social relationship and cultural convictions of the indigenous people. As everybody seemed lost in the reservoirs of containment by hailing the contribution of Nepali migrant workers to the economic development of Nepal, nobody seemed cognizant of the disconcerting side of the coin, the breakdown in the family structures and cultural mosaics. The void was not only created in the local labor markets, but also in the urgency of indigenous cultural behaviors and ritual practices.
In the past, my father used to remain busy throughout the year serving the village households as Yeba, performing different rituals of Limbu community like Sappok Chomen (ritual for womb worshipping prior to birth), Mangenna (ritual for good health, peace and progress), Mekkhim (ritual for marriage ceremony) etc. Due to his engagement in such activities of the community, I sometimes used to hear him complaining about not having time for his own household chores as a farmer. But he readily served the community on such occasions. I still remember how my father used to take pride in his narratives of being kidnapped by a supernatural wild shaman in his childhood who taught him the sacred knowledge of Mundhum and turned himself a self learnt Yeba, as one of the chosen persons by the God to save Limbu community from the various misfortunes and sickness. Gradually, my father and fellow Limbu shamans commonly called as Phedangma, Samba, Yeba and Yuma not only found their roles being drastically limited within the community, but they also failed to pass their knowledge to the next generation.
Hermeneutics of Tongsing Mundhum
According to Mundhum scholar Bairagi Kaila, Tongsing Mundhum is an extreme expression of social, ethical and religious beliefs of Limbu people. He writes in Tongsing Takma Mundhum: Aakhyan Ra Anusthan (Tongsing Takma Mundhum: Narratives and Rituals) that Tongsing Mundhum is a quintessential collection of oral literature and ethnic narratives that have been transferred orally from the time immemorial to the Limbu people. This Mundhum is recited and narrated along with music of brass plates and drums by Limbu shamans known as Samba, Yeba, and Yema during the performances of Tongsing Takma ritual. It is believed that Tongsing Mundhum was originated long before the art of writing was introduced.
According to scholar Chaintanya Subba, various myths, legends, narratives and oracles have been incorporated in Tongsing Mundhum which guide the social, ethical and religious concepts and shape the attitude and behavior of the Limbus. It consists of the various myths related to the origin of universe, human beings, plants and animals, and birth of the concepts of incest, jealousy, curse etc. in human society and the remedies for different problems in the society.
Limbus believe that there have been substantial influences of the Tongsing Mundhum in the customs, ideologies, moral values and life rituals of the Limbu community. It has a distinct pragmatic and instructional value with regards to the construction and continuation of various social practices and belief system in the Limbu community. It has played a crucial role in imparting the message of social solidarity and cooperation. However, there remains an effectual task for us to explore the social dimensions of Tongsing Takma ritual impacting the social life and practices of Limbus in the past.
Modernization has resulted into an irreversible loss of Limbu cultural heritages and ritual practices. A handful of enthusiasts of Limbu community are in disagreement themselves on which terminology best describes Limbu religion and cultural landscapes. Each group claims its own validity over the other but ironically overlooks the urgency of passing the knowledge to the coming generation. They don’t realize that culture and rituals live in society, not in institutions and books. If such cultural values can not be transferred to the coming generation, they would be the matter of history, to be searched in anthologies and museums. We certainly do not want that. So, rather than castigating others, we need to explore the nostrums to address the present challenges.
As the majority of young generation are detached from such ritual practices, an irreparable cultural void is being created every day. Incipient danger is that present generation could be the last generation of Limbu community practicing and living with the distinct cultural practices and Mundhum-based life rituals. As remaining Phedangma, Samba, Yeba and Yuma have failed to transfer their knowledge to the young generation, it would be very hard to find their disciples practicing these rituals through the oral recitation of Mundhum after one or two decades. Don’t get me wrong. I don’t want this to happen either. But I have not seen any other possibility too until we carry the torch of responsibility to stand as bulwarks to protect and preserve our distinctive cultural traits before they are pushed into oblivion by the varieties of intrusions.
Today, Tongsing Takma and other rituals have become rare events in Limbu community due to two main reasons: first, very few Limbu Phedangma, Samba, Yeba, and Yema are left in the community who can perform them in a proper way and second, young generation have no inclination to follow these rituals as they are gradually losing interest in the past ideals. This is not simply the fault of young generation living under the overwhelming fluctuations of information and technology. We must take responsibility for not infusing them cultural consciousness and not persuading them to adopt these value systems in everyday life.
Nowadays, a very few households are conducting Tongsing Takma and other rituals as a part of their daily lives mostly in remote villages. Some enthusiastic individuals and institutions are conducting this ritual in Kathmandu and other towns too. But such events largely become a simulacrum of the real Tongsing Takma, more as a frail attempt to recreate it and less as a distinct life rituals of the Limbu community. Such formalized occasions cannot persuade the heuristic value of these rituals to the coming generations.
The only positive sign in this area is there have been some works in the transcribing the oral scriptures of Mundhum recited by those Limbu shamans. In recent days, some Limbu scholars and writers have transcribed Mundhum in Limbu and Nepali language and have documented those ritual performances. In this direction, the colossus work of Mundhum expert Bairagi Kaila is always commendable. He has collected and transcribed most of the Mundhum with the help of Limbu Phedangma, Samba, Yeba, and Yema. I personally feel indebted to his huge contribution to the Limbu community by preserving Limbu Mundhum.
Years ago, in the night of the Tongsing Takma ritual, my father used to recite Mundhum and its myths in a rhythmic tone from his infallible memory followed by rhythmic beating of his brass plate and harmonious shamanic dancing steps. In the morning, he would perform the ritual of Silam Sakma (blocking the path of death) for the whole family concerned by reciting the Mundhum as:
A bright place due to the moon above us
A bright place due to the sun above us
In the place of life and age 
Are life and age decreasing?
Are the bells of time and death ringing?
Now, without letting the death bell ring
I toss this incanted coin 
To block the path of the death.
(Excerpts translated from the Tongsing Takma Mundhum: Aakhyan Ra Anusthan by Bairagi Kaila)
With these words, he would toss the coin in the name of each family member until the intended side of the coin overturned in the ground. The turning of the expected side of the coin is believed to have blocked the path of death, as a part of the ritual. I do not claim the efficacy of this ritual in the real time, but the psychological and mental asset of such rituals were certainly an important part of the community in past.
Once ardent practitioner of Mundhum based rituals, my father would spend hours discussing about Mundhum and its various myths deciphering their meaning and implications to us. He adored Mundhum as a treasure for Limbu community that teaches us to live in harmony with nature. He used to say all natural entities be it rivers, hills, caves, forests, or anything that we get from nature, have to be worshiped and preserved because they support human life in one way or the other. He was not being philosophical at that time, neither had he had any idea of the subject but he was simply passing his impression of Mundhum for our generation. Today, I feel that humankind have already deferred the deadline to respect the nature, by exploiting its resources to the fullest extent and wreaking an unprecedented havoc in its beauty. And obviously, we are getting paid by the effects of global warming and other disastrous natural phenomena for our irresponsible action towards nature threatening the existence of life in the blue planet.
Even though we listened to his stories enthusiastically, my father could figure out that his listeners were losing interests in them. Then his remarks would be same as always - time has changed…in our time………and so on. At this moment, I can sense the meaning of his words but the time has changed for me too. But what I fear most is I even may not have the same words to convey to my children by referring to the nostalgia of our time. The indispensable cultural values that ​​we have inherited from our ancestors have been eroding with the passage of time. We are living in an age of cultural deviation and oblivion. Now, when I sit by my ailing father living in his early eighties, I sometimes envisage him as Truganini (1812 –1876) the last full blood Aboriginal Tasmanian, whose culture and identity were completely swept away by the wave of 19th century colonialism."
118,blog,https://en.setopati.com/blog/158758,"The Summer of 2005 was my first birthday and no guests visited. There was a cake and a toy.
The toy was a helicopter with a broken wing that didn’t turn-on or chuff. I always wondered why it was like that.
Also, to bear in mind, my parents emigrated from Nepal when I was seven months old. I was too small, too chubby, and too witless to contribute to their struggle except for the grins and the giggles that made it easier for them to move on with their days.
Not until sophomore year in high school did I learn how much my parents had struggled during the early years in the US. I also found the helicopter didn’t run, only because my parents couldn’t afford a toy during that time. So, they rummaged that broken chopper from someone else’s trash.
Nonetheless, my intent in this narrative is not to inspire any sympathy. For me, this story is not as somber as it sounds. In fact, I got an opportunity to understand my parents’ struggle with a newfound humility. Their story and their sacrifice helped me get through a struggle, even if minor, was all my own.
Somewhere around the same time I was in high school, and nothing was going well. More importantly, I could not seem to get faster running cross-country. I had always loved running since early on, but at that point, the sport felt more like an obligation than a passion. I strove for motivation but failed to find one. At the heart of this disquietude, I knew the slip-up was only because without a clear plan, I just was not driven.
As fate would have it, one morning in September of 2019, while I was struggling to run at the practice, Jaclyn, one of my faster running mates, asked me to run with her. I refused at first because I knew I couldn't keep up with her and yet, for some reason, I decided to plug away. That day, I called out on whatever was holding me back and I ran with her. I ran for myself and for my parents, and I ran to be the best version of my possibility.
This gave me confidence and made me realize that I could accomplish what I thought was unimaginable. I realized my doubts and insecurities stemmed from my failure to push myself outside my comfort zone and that merely wanting something is not enough. I also had to act on it!
After that day, I proactively began creating a routine that I consistently followed. Just in a few weeks, I started seeing improvements.
Aside from the track, I also got in touch with a few friends from Nepal and created a think tank named ‘The Connectors.’ The goal of this group was to support Nepal’s diplomacy with the other countries, especially its neighbors like India, China, and Bangladesh.
I became one of the senior captains in the Colleyville Heritage High School Cross-Country team. We qualified for the state three years consecutively and our team finished fourth among 5A Schools in Texas during the 2021 season. Meanwhile, I also frequently volunteer by visiting the middle school runners to motivate and encourage them.
I often think about that moment in my sophomore year where something snapped into the place, and I began to turn my life around. Some part of me believes that moment is defined by my friend’s lending hand while the other part is the inspiration from my parents' adversities.
Nietzsche once said, 'A person with a Why can bear any How or What.'
That forlorn summer morning, that dwindling moment of despair and gratitude, when those hapless hands picked that toy, that’s where I found my ‘Why’.
The lowest moment my dad and my mom endured to give me a wisp of joy is now my highest moment to give them theirs back.

119,blog,https://en.setopati.com/blog/158091,"For a very long time we have been hearing the government’s intention to regulate the over the top (OTT) and other services providing internet content in Nepal. Well, the wait is over as the government has recently come up with the amendment in the National Broadcasting Regulation 1995 (2052).
The 11th amendment of the regulation has included OTT, video on demand (VOD), and internet television under 'Other Means of Communications'. With the said inclusion, the regulation now requires OTT and internet television to register to provide its service in Nepal. The term OTT has been defined as the service of displaying the programs as per the demand of the consumer through the internet without using the means of direct to home (DTH) cable or satellite and such term shall also include the media streaming services through other platforms by the means of internet. Further, internet television (Internet TV) has included the regular act of transmission of the self-produced audio-visual programs through the internet.
This definition will require popular streaming service providers like YouTube, Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc. to obtain approval from the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology. The regulation has further provisioned for the mandatory requirement of the cache server within Nepal if the OTT service provider intends to make any member or customer in Nepal or acquire any kind of fees from Nepal. It has also required the storage of user information within the server of Nepal. Further, the OTT service providers should keep a record of the programs transmitted by them, for at least 60 days and the same shall also be made accessible to the ministry and other governmental authorities in the process of investigations.
The content to be displayed through OTT must also be subject to categorization as per age. The “U” rating must be granted for such content which is appropriate to all the age groups whereas “A” rating is provided to the content for the age group above 18 years. “R” rating, similarly, provided to the content appropriate to the age group of 10-18 years.
The regulation also provisions that the ministry can take control of such equipment or make necessary arrangements to disallow the operation of such equipment which has been used for transmission or communication of the program in an unauthorized manner without obtaining necessary license or approval as required by the regulation.
As the regulation has mandatorily required approval of the ministry in order to distribute the content through the internet in Nepal, it is worth observing to see whether the foreign companies providing such services to the users based in Nepal comply. Due to the limited market of users in Nepal, it is less likely the service providers would be willing to register in Nepal as it may also trigger other compliance requirement as per the laws of Nepal. Further, it would be important to see what the government’s next step would be as the regulation is silent on the time period to comply with such requirements and what would it do to foreign OTT service providers if they fail to comply with the licensing requirement of the regulation."
120,blog,https://en.setopati.com/blog/158028,"I was first introduced to Panauti by John Sanday, the British conservation architect, who was in charge in the 1970s of the restoration of Hanuman Dhoka palace at the center of Kathmandu by UNESCO and has resided in the Nepali capital from that time on.
It was in 1976. I was already familiar with Nepal and the Kathmandu Valley. I had been the cultural attaché at the French Embassy in 1970-71, and afterward spent nearly one year in the remote Newar village of Pyangaun in Lalitpur district, a village inhabited by Jyapu paddy-cultivators. These farmers were also at that time makers of bamboo boxes for measuring grains (rice, wheat), pyang in Nepal Bhasha. They used to exchange these boxes against food grains at several localities of the Kathmandu Valley in winter. Subsequently, I prepared and passed a PhD dissertation in the field of social anthropology (Paris University) on that village and joined the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS), the main public organization for research in France, in 1975. I had learned local languages with students and teachers and was quite fluent at that time in Newari.
I remember very well my first time in Panauti with John Sanday. We were looking for a house to rent. The authorities of the locality guided us toward a Karmacharya family inhabiting in the lower part of the town, toward the sacred confluence of the Rosi and Punyamati rivers. The gharpatini, mistress of the house, and her daughter welcomed us. They offered us some food with very strong ayela (rice alcohol) and rented me a house nearby, with a very nice view of Indreshwar Mahadev temple and the Jangam math, the religious establishment where the priests of the Shaivite three-storied temple were inhabiting. The ground floor was used by a health post and a small vegetable garden was attached. It was an ideal place to work. It was decided that three young French architects would join me to undertake a full basic research work on Panauti. During our common period of fieldwork, we would focus on space and architecture. One of these architects, Vincent Barré, was already my friend. He came some years before to Pyangaun to help me draw a map of the village.
I moved to Panauti in the rainy season. I came on foot from Godavari with my cook and porter Sarkiman, crossing the range and descending on the other side of the mountain. We didn’t know the way exactly and got lost in the clouds. It was raining. We had to spend a night on the way in a Tamang house. We arrived at our destination the next morning. My three friends, who came by bus from Kathmandu the day before, were already there. We started the work immediately. Some inhabitants from Panauti joined us to draw a detailed map of the locality, which at that time didn’t exist. We set up three teams with local people for this topographical survey. It took us about 10 days to complete the preliminary job with double decameter ropes. All corners of the city were mapped. It must be said that from the very beginning Panauti inhabitants proved to be very friendly and cooperative with us. This assistance continued in all phases of the research. Perhaps they guessed that their locality would derive some benefits out of this research.
This happened to be true: some years later, in the 1990s, the cultural branch of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs started renovating the main temples of the city, that were in a sorry condition, under the supervision of the Nepali Department of Archaeology. Several other projects focused on more secular matters, especially schools, platforms alongside the streets and an underground pipe system were also launched and implemented. In addition, some grants were allocated to the local youths in the field of technology. Robert Le Foll, a former member of the French Parliament, has been very active in this regard. Panauti became a symbol of French and Nepali cooperation.
Three persons from Panauti collaborated with us in a very important and fruitful manner: Ananta Madhikarmi, Chandeshwari Buddhacharya (Shakya), Shiva Jangam, who at the time was the priest of Indreshwar Mahadev temple, and Bisunath Tamrakar. I remember that I surveyed with Ananta Madhikarmi all the houses of the small city, collecting data on the population, as well as on economic data of every family, for instance the surface area (in ropani) of their paddy-fields whether privately owned or just labored as tenants. The French architects stayed for about three months in Panauti and went back to Paris where they were running a private architect enterprise. For my own part, I concentrated the following years almost entirely on Panauti city, its social and religious organization. My rented house was very convenient. I could invite some guests and friends from Kathmandu for lunch or for the weekend. It was also an appropriate place to work with my different local informants and offer them some tea. During the daytime, I used to spend time in the various tea stalls discussing with people on different subjects. And every night, I took a tour of the city along the river and within the market area. I made fantastic day trips with Ananta in the surrounding villages and religious places.
Altogether, I spent nearly one year on the spot, from 1977 till 1980. At the end, I offered a bhoj (a feast) to all the persons, Newars and Jangams mostly, who worked with me in the community. I had to sacrifice a goat to the nearby Ganesh on that occasion. Afterward, I presented my ethnographical materials in the Paris University in 1982 and obtained a second more elaborate PhD, after the first one obtained thanks to my study of Pyangaun. We call this superior type of Doctorate “Doctorat d’Etat” in French (this type of Doctorate disappeared from the university courses a little later). With the French architects, our common book written in French language was finally published in 1981 in Paris: Panauti, uneville au Népal (Panauti, a Town in Nepal). It is focused on history, social organization, use of space, domestic and religious architecture. A facsimile edition has been published recently in Kathmandu by Vajra Publications. Unfortunately, this book has not yet been translated in English or Nepali.
In 1976, Panauti, a multi-caste locality, counted around 2,900 inhabitants, among which the vast majority were Newars (97%). It was a small historic city with an important market hub and a great number of pasals (shops) where the surrounding villagers could buy nearly all the items they needed. The market extension at the entrance of the locality, near the Maneshwari (Varahi) temple, already existed in its primary form. It developed dramatically in the following years, destabilizing the life of the small city and redirecting the market activities from the center to the periphery.
In my views, the small town of Panauti can be analyzed through two main different paradigms: the mandalic (or cosmological) model and the socioeconomic change paradigm. I had already recently published a book with a number of photographs on the second aspect: Panauti: Past and present (1976-2020). Let me focus here on the mandalic structure.
At first, the triangular shape of the city is clear. Panauti lies at the confluence of two rivers: the Punyamati to the north, and the Rosikhola to the south. The top of the triangle is pointed to the east. It is believed that a third river—subterranean, invisible river—supposedly flowing from the north under the Brahmayani three-storied temple, meets there. This third hidden river conveys a high sacral aura to the spot. The ritual place, called triveni (confluence of three rivers), is located at this junction and contains many religious monuments. This important religious confluence is visited by religious people every morning and evening. The inhabitants of the surrounding villages come there for cremation.
This triveni confluence gives to Panauti the status of a famous pilgrimage site, known all over central Nepal and even in Northern India. Every 12 years, the Makar Mela (fair) is celebrated on that very place, in the solar month of Magh (January-February). On that occasion, thousands of pilgrims wash away their sins by bathing at the confluence of the three rivers. I described this festival in a long article published 10 years ago in a volume called Sin and Sinners (Brill, 2012). According to the inhabitants, the city has a form of a fish. The main temple of Indreshwar Mahadev, originally built in the 13th century by a Newar princess named Birma Devi and run by Jangam (Lingayat) priests, is related to this religious confluence. The outer impressive struts, which decorate the religious monument with eminent figures of Hindu mythology, are a testimony of the antiquity of the temple. In 1977, we asked the children of Panauti to draw a map of their city, as they imagined. All represented their locality in a triangular form, the triveni oriented upward, to the north, giving to the city the form of a mountain (except one who placed the apex of the triangle downward).
Yet, this structure is not enough to understand the city. In the 1970s, the urban zone of Panauti was still clearly separated from the outside by an outer circle of eight goddesses’ temples, dedicated to the Ashta (eight) Matrika of the Hindu-Buddhist Tantric tradition. A specific direction in space corresponds to each of these goddesses. They protect the city against diseases and evil spirits and are regularly worshipped on specific days of the lunar calendar. The temple of Brahmayani, is the most important of these religious monuments. It faces the confluence of the rivers, on the opposite bank of the city.
This outer religious ring is centered on a large esplanade located at the epicenter of the old city, which is called layku, royal palace, by the local people. Located nearby, a small altar is dedicated to the ancient divinity and guardian deity of the Newar Malla kings, the Taleju goddess. Offerings are made there every year, during Dashain festival (mostly in October). This zone is presently under archaeological investigation by the Nepali Department of Archaeology. As a matter of fact, during a temporary period of the medieval age, Panauti had been the seat of a small independent or semi-independent kingdom/principality. In addition, as all Newar settlements, Panauti is divided between an upper part (thane) and a lower part, (kwane) according to the direction for the nearby river. This division passes through the “royal” center of the city.
This geometrical spatial structure, a center surrounded by eight temples supposedly located in the eight directions of the universe, gives to Panauti the form of a mandala religious diagram, a micro-representation of the universe. The Karmacharyas who are presently the Tantric priests of these goddesses’ sanctuaries, still have a clear vision of this cosmic configuration. It was applied to Panauti during the Malla medieval time to convey to the locality a royal status and to give her a prestigious microcosmic image of the universe. In this regard, Panauti can be considered as a reduced form of the neighboring larger Hindu city of Bhaktapur, where the German researchers (Kölver and Gutschow) have uncovered a similar layout, associated with identical religious representations. As I showed in my research works, the mandalic structure of the city still dominates the religious life of Panauti and comes in full light during the main religious festival celebrated there, particularly during Dashain celebrations and the main jatra (festival, procession) of the city, in the month of May, just before the rainy season: the Jyaa Punhi festival.

121,blog,https://en.setopati.com/blog/157721,"The Nepal Academy has recently published photojournalist Bharat Bandhu Thapa's picture book 'Nepal in Pictures'.
The 320-page book includes over 500 photographs depicting tourism, arts, culture and society from Mechi in the east to Mahakli in the west and the height of Mt Everest to the lowlands of Kechanakaval. 
""My objective was to ensure that those who want to know Nepal get to see the main views and know the main specialties of the country in a single book. I was, therefore, working on it for a long time,"" Thapa tells Setopati. ""Nepal is such a big country that it is not possible to include the whole country in 320 pages. But I have tried to include different possibilities of the country as far as I know in this book.""
He added that the book will be polished further in the future. 
The pictures in the books depict places from Olangchung Gola in the east to Kalapani in the Far West, Khaptad, Badimalika, Upper Dolpo, Lumbini, Janaki Temple, Shukaphant to the culture of the Kathmandu Valley. ""Most of the pictures in the book have been clicked by me. But I have not travelled across the whole country. I was undecided about whether to include the places I have not visited or not,"" he reveals. ""I finally decided that those places should not be excluded from the book even if I have not visited.""
He has sought photos of those places from his friends and says that has prevented the book from being incomplete.

122,blog,https://en.setopati.com/blog/157720,"I want to preface this blog by clarifying that what I am positing here is not an attack on anybody’s personal integrity but an attempt to reveal a tendency, perhaps all too human, that often underpins our political biases and colors our vision in such a way that we lose sight of the future.
The political bias I am going to describe here is something that I prefer to call as “the bias of the present,” or, in other words, the tendency to view current political climate as though it is going to continue as it is forever in the future. Adam Gopnik, a popular writer for the US-based magazine, “The New Yorker,” calls it “presentism,” which he defines as, “an assumption that what is happening now is going to keep on happening, without anything happening to stop it.” I prefer to use the word “bias” because of the unreasonable prejudice attached to this kind of thinking.
This kind of bias in thinking is now famously attributed to Francis Fukuyama, the renowned political thinker, who, at one time, declared that the world had come to an “end of history” with liberal capitalist democracies being the climactic endpoint. Fukuyama, who is still pilloried for his rather Panglossian view, argued that countries all over the world were becoming more freer, more liberal, more tolerant, and getting closer and closer to a utopia very similar to the liberal democracies in the West. Fukuyama’s grand utterances are seen today as a cautionary—and an instructive—moment for public intellectuals who are inclined to make sweeping claims about the future by simply looking at the current trends.
Sadly, the current Bibeksheel Sajha Party (BSP), which was supposed to represent the optimism of the youths in the country, seems to be doing a Fukuyama in reverse. Rabindra Mishra and his like-minded coterie in the current BSP formed after the recent purges, are engaged in an overly pessimistic portrayal of present Nepal and have accordingly projected a pessimistic future for the country as though the situation can only get worse from here. Under Mishra, the current BSP apparatus seems almost eager to see the current situation spiral out of control so that their egos will be satisfied, and their recently espoused political lines, vindicated. But in so doing, Mishra and the BSP have not only led the movement of the youths astray but have also muddled the public perception by overestimating their own power while underestimating the fundamental feature of a democracy, namely its auto-correctional tendencies.
In the past BSP was popular among the youths because the party embodied the hopes and optimism that can only spring from the resourceful idealism and energy of the young people. No one expected BSP to form a viable alternative to the prevailing political parties, but everyone took pleasure from the fact that the youths were raising the consciousness of the public by demanding accountability from public officials and showing a new possibility for the future. Alongside the civil society, BSP stood at a sweet spot (call it the Goldilocks of Nepali politics), just outside the fray of everyday politics, but also within it in such a way that it could act both as a party, demanding accountability and good governance, but also as an idealisticentity that projected an optimistic and much-needed normative framework for the future of the country’s politics. The party was extremely successful given its limited reach and resources. The demonstrations against Nepal Banda, in particular, became a huge success while the party also gained enormous support in its fight against government corruption and incompetency, especially in the demonstrations against increasing instances of rapes and sexual assaults around the country.
The party was doing exactly what it was supposed to do until Mishra woke up one morning and blindsided his own party members—who had sacrificed their youthful energy, time, and resources—by highjacking the party and free riding on its goodwill. An idealistic party that represented hope for the future was overnight turned into an in-group that delighted in the same muck that it was supposed to transcend.
Now, there is no doubt that Rabindra Mishra is a gentleman who is genuinely worried about the current state of affairs in the country. In fact, as someone who is extremely self-aware of his public persona, Mishra, in my opinion, is willing to maintain a level of honesty and transparency that has not yet been seen from any of our leaders. There is no doubt in his honest endeavors. However, a nice coiffeur and a bright persona can only take you so far when the political line you have chosen depends on painting a dark picture. Mishra has, either wittingly or unwittingly, narrowed the imagination of the youths in the country by taking their movement to a dead end. He has done a great disservice by putting his ego before the ethos of the youths.
Most importantly though, Mishra and the current BSP are omitting a fundamental difference between the current political system—however flawed—that we have versus the system that they are advocating for: the system that we currently have has an inbuilt feature that will slowly but effectively autocorrect its mistakes, while the system that the current BSP is advocating for has an inbuilt bug that will only rear its ugly head again and again.
Like many others, I looked at BSP as a party of youths who were not beholden to any established political power. Despite its limited clout, the party was able to transcend the filth of Nepali politics and demand accountability by galvanizing the youths who brought new energy, vision, and optimism to an otherwise ossified party culture in Nepal. Just as the Nepali people were only beginning to believe and share the idealism of the youths, the bias of the present took over BSP and brought the project to a screeching halt."
123,blog,https://en.setopati.com/blog/157453,"As someone steeped in liberal values it certainly feels odd and slightly uneasy to defend a leader who carried—or perhaps still carries—a huge baggage of totalitarian ideology that is antithetical to my own political beliefs. Despite the deep-seated cognitive dissonance, however, I am making a pitch for a liberal Prachanda not because I condone his actions as a supremo of the armed uprising, but because I think his political survival is necessary for a progressive and forward-looking Nepal that is focused on the principles of individual rights and dignity. Despite his personal and political flaws, which he himself has openly acknowledged on several occasions—a rare instance among Nepali politicians or any politicians for that matter—I believe that Prachanda has been a force who has championed the liberal cause in Nepal. At a time when zealotry is rearing its head and the moderates are hobbled by their own incompetency and lack of leadership, Prachanda’s political survival has become indispensable to prevent the country from sliding backwards from its social and political gains.
Even as the country continues to wobble under the weight of egotistical power jockeying of a few politicians (including Prachanda), there has in fact been some significant progress in matters of individual rights, minority rights and their access to justice in the past few years. For all its destruction, any reasonable person who is not driven by personal agendas, will agree that the Maoist Revolution empowered the section of the population that had heretofore been relegated to live as second-class citizens. It is safe to say that the Maoist uprising threw away the yoke of arbitrary customs and traditions that had kept the minorities in positions of permanent subservience and has compelled the hitherto Kathmandu-centric governments to pay attention to broader Nepal, beyond the metropolis. To be sure, the Maoists opened the floodgates for both the good and the bad, and there is no doubt that Prachanda’s earlier misgivings toward the multiparty democratic system weakened both his political standing as well as people’s trust in the newly established system. Unfortunately, but not surprisingly, the progressive political achievements are now under attack as some political opportunists try to roll back the clock by undermining every liberal value—from secularism to constitutionalism to republicanism.
It is in this context I believe that Nepal needs a liberal Prachanda more than ever. Not the self-serving Prachanda confined to his doctrinal ideology who is always on the lookout for opportunities to burnish his personal image, but a Prachanda who speaks to and champions the needs of the poor, the marginalized and the vulnerable. Nepal needs a Prachanda who consistently keeps the interest of the vulnerable and the marginalized at the front and center of his politics and is guided by a moral imperative to do good for those who have been wronged in the name of caste, creed, geography, or economic status. Nepal needs a liberal Prachanda who doesn’t engage in an unwarranted nationalistic jingoism, who doesn’t make over-the-top ridiculous claims, who doesn’t engage in short-sighted tactical power brokerage, but a Prachanda who is less a politician than a moral character who transcends—or at least tries to transcend—partisan politics. Nepal needs a Prachanda who isn’t afraid to lose elections, but nevertheless finds ways to champion the causes of the less privileged. Nepal needs a Prachanda who is chastised by his past mistakes, who isn’t hungry for power, who is ready to forgo the limelight, and who understands that he doesn’t always have to be at the center of power and politics to do good.
Perhaps I might be asking too much from Prachanda, for how can Prachanda live without being Prachanda, a leader who shot to power by brute force of the gun? How can the man, the rebel, and the commander abandon his core ideology that revolves around power grabbing and gaining control of the state? The road ahead may be difficult, but it is doable. The name Prachanda now needs a complete makeover as does the character behind the name. Prachanda needs to start a revolution once again, but this time the revolution should be internal, within himself, and the guiding principles of that revolution should be morality, equality, and justice. Nepal doesn’t necessarily need a Prachanda in power, but it needs the voice of a liberal Prachanda who can lead a moral revolution toward an open, tolerant, kind, and just Nepal."
124,blog,https://en.setopati.com/blog/156947,"Menstruation is a part of the reproductive cycle; it is as natural as any secretion that your body discharges. It is a monthly reality for billions of women and girls around the globe. A natural biological process, which should dignify women and girls, has become a subject of shame due to taboos and myths that exclude women from many aspects of socio-cultural life. Despite the advancement in societal understanding, identifying menstruation as ‘impure’ is still deeply embedded in religion, cultural belongings, and societal practices.
Nepali society is also prey to the regressive mindset and social practice regarding menstruation. The taboo of vaginal discharge has put women at the back in society all through ages. From religious texts like Swasthanikatha, to story of Rishi Panchami all exemplify how menstruation is a sin and how women are victims of this natural process. The story of Rishi Panchami follows a woman named Sushila who entered the kitchen while menstruating during her past life. This was her biggest sin, and due to which she was reborn as a dog to be treated like one. Her husband in return is also reincarnated as a bull carrying the sin of his wife. The heartrending part is, we as Hindus glorify these myths and perform a yearly ritual on Rishi Panchami just to wash our sin of menstruating away. When we hear these myths we wonder, if goddesses Parvati, Laxmi, Saraswoti, Kali, Durga ever menstruated? If they did, how come they are prayed throughout the year, even during that time of the month?
Nepali societies in the past have exaggerated the myth surrounding menstruation and have twisted their own product of what menstruation shall actually be. Followed by a lot of don’ts: don’t sit there, don’t touch that, don’t enter the kitchen, don’t touch water source, don’t sleep in the bed, don’t wear the same clothes, don’t stay in the home and whole bunch of don’ts follows. Such taboos about menstruation present in many societies impact girls’ and women's emotional state, mentality and lifestyle, and most importantly, health. A lot of these superstitions are behavioral restrictions that, aside from being untrue, contribute to gender-based discrimination. Every adolescent girl has to miss her school and every woman has to sacrifice social functions, festivals, and daily life only because she is born to be the carrier of life. These “don’ts” have taken the lives of many women, in the form of Chhau (shed for menstruating women) or unhealthy menstruating practices. Yet, we claim that women are treated as equal in our society. How unfortunate!
The mentality of impure and untouchable has transcended from rural villages to posh educated families of suburban and urban cities of Nepal. It’s an embarrassment that highly educated families like ours are still practicing this taboo inflicted by our regressive society. Despite being a woman of modern thoughts and ideologies, we are chained by these ‘don’ts’ just because we are too vulnerable to hurt the religious sentiments of our parents and the regressive society which means everything to them. 
Despite the government's efforts on criminalizing any kind of discriminatory behavior during menstruation, and demolishing menstrual huts in Achham, Surkhet, Dailekh, Bajhang, Salyan and other districts, the practice is still present loud and proud in every household of the country. The poignant part is that everyone is getting so used to this practice that it is not seen as discrimination. Society is evolving, people are adapting to all sorts of technologies and innovations, they are challenging their way of life yet their mindset is static and changing that has been a slow burn.""Everyone wants change, but no one wants to change"". The challenge, of addressing the socio-cultural taboos and beliefs in menstruation, is compounded by the lack of knowledge and understanding of puberty, menstruation, and reproductive health. Thus, there is a need to follow a strategic approach to combat these issues.
The solution to all this is simple and can be covered by one word “MINDSET”. Unless we change our mindset and grow out of the religious stigma, this practice is going nowhere. Rather than taking it as a shame, it’s about time we celebrated it as the greatest gift of human life. We all were born because there was someone menstruating; it’s a celebration of life, celebration of womanhood, and celebration of women power. Rather than being whispered in ears and wrapped in newspapers, it shall be a normal day act. Just think about it, men secrete sperms every single day, we do not consider them untouchables. Women do the same thing once a month and there is all the fuss about that.  To change the mindset and outlook at this boon (currently misunderstood as sin), there is still a long way to go and the journey starts with you."
125,International,https://en.setopati.com/International/159229,"President Xi JInping warned against meddling in China’s dealings with Taiwan during a phone call with his U.S. counterpart, Joe Biden, that gave no indication of progress on trade, technology or other irritants, including Beijing’s opposition to a top American lawmaker’s possible visit to the island democracy, which the mainland claims as its own territory.
Xi also warned against splitting the world’s two biggest economies, according to a Chinese government summary of Thursday’s unusually lengthy, three-hour call. Businesspeople and economists warn such a change, brought on by Chinese industrial policy and U.S. curbs on technology exports, might hurt the global economy by slowing innovation and increasing costs.
Meanwhile, Xi and Biden are looking at the possibility of meeting in person, according to a U.S. official who declined to be identified further. Xi has been invited to Indonesia in November for a meeting of the Group of 20 major economies, making it a potential location for a face-to-face meeting.
The Chinese government gave no indication Xi and Biden discussed possible plans by U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to visit Taiwan, which the ruling Communist Party says has no right to conduct foreign relations. But Xi rejected “interference by external forces” that might encourage Taiwan to try to make its decades-old de facto independence permanent.
“Resolutely safeguarding China’s national sovereignty and territorial integrity is the firm will of the more than 1.4 billion Chinese people,” said the statement. “Those who play with fire will perish by it.”
The tough language from Xi, who usually tries to appear to be above political disputes and makes blandly positive public comments, suggested Chinese leaders might believe Washington didn’t understand the seriousness of previous warnings about Taiwan.
Taiwan and China split in 1949 following a civil war that ended with a Communist victory on the mainland. They have no official relations but are linked by billions of dollars of trade and investment. Both sides say they are one country but disagree over which government is entitled to national leadership.
A Ministry of Defense spokesman said ahead of Thursday’s call that Washington “must not arrange for Pelosi to visit Taiwan.” He said the ruling party’s military wing, the People’s Liberation Army, would take “strong measures to thwart any external interference.”
Xi called on the United States to “honor the one-China principle,” the statement said, referring to Beijing’s position that the mainland and Taiwan are one country. The United States, by contrast, has a “one-China policy” that says Washington takes no position on the question but wants to see it resolved peacefully.
“Both sides of the Taiwan Strait belong to one and the same China,” the statement said.
The statement cited Biden as saying the United States doesn’t support independence for Taiwan.
Coverage of the conversation in China’s entirely state-controlled media on Friday was limited to repeating government statements.
Pelosi has yet to confirm whether she will go to Taiwan, but if she does, the Democrat from California would be the highest-ranking elected American official to visit since then-Speaker Newt Gingrich in 1997.
Beijing criticized Gingrich for saying the United States would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese attack but did little else in response to his three-hour visit to the island.
Since then, China’s position on Taiwan has hardened as the mainland economy grew to become second-largest after the United States. The ruling party poured hundreds of billions of dollars into developing fighter jets and other high-tech weapons including “carrier killer” missiles that are thought to be intended to block the U.S. Navy from helping to defend the island.
The conflict over a possible Pelosi visit is more sensitive to Beijing in a year when Xi, who took power in 2012, is expected to try to break with tradition and award himself a third five-year term as party leader.
Xi, who wants to be seen as restoring China’s rightful historic role as a global leader, has promoted a more assertive policy abroad. The PLA has sent growing numbers of fighter planes and bombers to fly near Taiwan in an attempt to intimidate its democratically elected government.
The United States has no official relations with Taiwan but has extensive commercial ties and informal political connections. Washington is obliged by federal law to see that Taiwan has the means to defend itself.
Xi called for cooperation on reducing the risk of economic recession, coordinating macroeconomic policies, fighting COVID-19 and “de-escalation of regional hot spots,” according to the government statement.
He also warned against decoupling, or separating, the U.S. and Chinese economies for strategic reasons.
Businesspeople and industry analysts have warned global industries might be split into separate markets with incompatible products due to China’s pressure on its own companies to develop their own technology standards and U.S. restrictions on Chinese access to technology that Washington see as a security risk. That might slow innovation and increase costs.
“Attempts at decoupling or severing supply chains in defiance of underlying laws would not help boost the U.S. economy,” the statement said. “They would only make the world economy more vulnerable.”"

127,International,https://en.setopati.com/International/160830,"French President Emmanuel Macron’s unpopular plan to raise France’s retirement age from 62 to 64 was enacted into law Saturday, the day after the country’s constitutional body approved the change.
Macron’s signature and publication in the Official Journal of the French Republic allowed the law to enter into force. The authorized changes will start being implemented in September, French government spokesperson Olivier Veran said.
On Friday, the Constitutional Council rejected some parts of the government’s pension legislation but approved the higher minimum retirement age, which was central to Macron’s plan and the focus of opponents’ protests.
The nine-member council’s decision capped months of tumultuous debates in parliament and fervor in the streets. Spontaneous demonstrations took place in Paris and across the country after the ruling.
France’s main labor unions, which organized 12 nationwide protests since January in hopes of defeating the plan, have vowed to continue fighting until it is withdrawn. They called for another mass protest on May 1, which is International Workers’ Day.
The government argued that requiring people to work two years more before qualifying for a pension was needed to keep the pension system afloat as the population ages; opponents proposed raising taxes on the wealthy or employers instead, and said the change threatened a hard-won social safety net.
Opinion polls show Macron’s popularity has plunged to its lowest level in four years. The centrist president, who made raising the retirement age a priority of his second term, plans to make a televised national address on Monday evening, Macron’s office said.
“The president’s remarks are very much awaited” and will both seek to appease tensions in the country and explain decisions that have been made in the past months regarding the pension reform, government spokesperson Veran said.
Macron was first elected in 2017 on a promise to make France’s economy more competitive, including by making people work longer.
Since then, his government has made it easier to hire and fire workers, cut business taxes and made it more difficult for the unemployed to claim benefits."
128,International,https://en.setopati.com/International/160829,"The death toll from Russian missile strikes on eastern Ukraine’s city of Sloviansk rose to 11 Saturday as rescue crews tried to reach people trapped in the rubble of an apartment building, Ukrainian authorities said.
Ukraine’s air force said the country would soon have weapons with which to try to prevent attacks like the one on Friday. The delivery of the Patriot air defense system promised by the U.S. was expected in Ukraine sometime after Easter, Ukrainian air force spokesperson Yuriy Ihnat said.
The primarily Orthodox Christian country is preparing to observe Easter on Sunday. Speaking Saturday on Ukrainian state TV, Ihnat declined to give a precise timeline for the arrival of the defensive missile system but said the public would know “as soon as the first Russian aircraft is shot down.”
A group of 65 Ukrainian soldiers completed their training last month at Fort Sill, a U.S. Army post in Oklahoma, and returned to Europe to learn more about using the defensive missile system to track and shoot down enemy aircraft.
Officials said at the time that the Ukrainians would then go back to their country with a Patriot missile battery, which typically includes six mobile launchers, a mobile radar, a power generator and an engagement control center.
Germany and the Netherlands also have pledged to provide a Patriot system each to Ukraine. In addition, a SAMP/T anti-missile system pledged by France and Italy “should enter Ukraine in the near future,” Ihnat said this week.
The Ukrainian military is looking to beef up its ability to intercept missiles as it prepares for an expected spring counter-offensive to retake Russian-occupied areas of the country. Although more than a year of fighting has depleted weapons supplies on both sides, Russian forces have intensified their 8 1/2-month campaign to seize the city of Bakhmut, the focus of the war’s longest battle so far.
Bakhmut and Sloviansk are located about 45 kilometers (28 miles) apart in eastern Ukraine’s Donetsk province.
Rescue teams in Sloviansk recovered the bodies of two people from under the rubble of a house hit in Friday’s missile strikes, according to the State Emergency Service. They also searched Saturday for five people who remained in the wreckage of the apartment building, as well as the residents of three units who were reported missing, Vadym Liakh, the head of the local government, said.
Separately, a 48-year-old woman and her 28-year-old daughter died Saturday after Russian forces shelled a neighborhood of the city of Kherson, the regional administration said on Telegram. The southern port city was occupied by Russian forces in the early months of the war, but Ukrainian forces regained control of it in November, one of the most notable battlefield defeats for Moscow.
A new law signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday that allows military offices to send draft notices electronically instead of delivering them in person is part of Russia’s preparation for a protracted war in Ukraine, the U.K. Defense Ministry said in a Saturday morning assessment.
According to British intelligence, a “unified registry of individuals eligible for military service” will be digitally linked to other government services, allowing Russian authorities to “punish draft-dodgers by automatically limiting employment rights and restricting foreign travel.”
Since the law does not come into force until later in the year, the U.K. Defense Ministry said the e-notices do not automatically point to a “major new wave of enforced mobilization” but rather form part of a “longer-term approach to provide personnel as Russia anticipates a lengthy conflict in Ukraine.”
Meanwhile, 52,000 young Russian men already have received draft orders as part of the country’s regular spring call-up, and 21,000 of them qualified for military service, Col. Andrey Biryukov, who is in charge of mobilization, said Saturday.
Biryukov addressed concerns that the new electronic conscription law presaged a broader mobilization of reservists, like one Putin ordered in September.
“I’d like to stress that all army deferrals for citizens will still be valid. And e-draft orders will not be mailed in bulk,” Biryukov said."
129,International,https://en.setopati.com/International/160826,"Ukraine’s foreign minister said Thursday his country won’t budge from its demand that Russia withdraw its forces from Crimea, as well as from other parts of Ukraine that Moscow illegally annexed more recently, for the war to end.
Calling the conflict in Ukraine “a bleeding wound in the middle of Europe,” Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said all his country’s territory must be treated equally in dealing with the Kremlin after its full-scale invasion more than 13 months ago.
“We are united by U.N. charter principles and the shared conviction that Crimea is Ukraine and it will return under Ukraine’s control,” Kuleba said, speaking by video link to a gathering in the Romanian capital, Bucharest.
“Every time you hear anyone from any corner of the world saying that Crimea is somehow special and should not be returned to Ukraine, as any other part of our territory, you have to know one thing: Ukraine categorically disagrees with these statements,” he said at the Black Sea Security Conference.
Russia took over Crimea in 2014, and during the current war has expanded its presence there. Occasional acts of sabotage and other attacks against Russian military and other facilities on the peninsula have occurred since, with the Kremlin blaming Ukraine. The Kyiv government hasn’t claimed responsibility for the attacks but welcomes efforts to repel the Russian presence there.
The Kremlin wants Kyiv to acknowledge Russia’s sovereignty over Crimea and also recognize September’s annexation of the Ukrainian provinces of Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk, and Zaporizhzhia.
Ukraine has rejected those demands and won’t hold talks with Russia until Moscow’s troops pull back from all occupied territories.
Though there is no sign of possible peace negotiations, the two countries have sporadically exchanged prisoners of war and have engaged in a wartime deal for the export of Ukrainian grain and Russian grain and fertilizers. The grain deal has helped ease concerns about the global food supply, especially to countries in Africa, the Middle East and parts of Asia where many are already struggling with hunger.
The agreement, which the U.N. and Turkey brokered last July, is delicate, however, and Moscow has repeatedly threatened to end it.
In the latest dispute, Russia’s Foreign Ministry said Thursday that no discussion about extending the Black Sea grain deal beyond May 18 would take place until progress was made towards resolving what it called “five systemic problems” that have resulted from sanctions on Russia over the war.
It said in a statement those issues were: reconnecting the state-owned Russian Agricultural Bank to the SWIFT international banking system; resuming supplies to Russia of agricultural machinery, spare parts and services; lifting restrictions on insurance and reinsurance and the ban on access to ports; restoring the operation of the Tolyatti-Odesa ammonia pipeline; and unblocking foreign assets and accounts of Russian companies related to the production and transportation of food and fertilizers.
Russia agreed last month to extend the grain deal for 60 days — instead of the 120 days set under a previous extension — to send a warning to the West.
On the battlefield, military analysts say, an anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive in coming months could aim at the land corridor between Russia and Crimea, hoping to split Russia’s forces in two.
That would be a daunting military challenge. Satellite images show the Kremlin’s forces are digging extensive trench systems between mainland Ukraine and the Black Sea peninsula.
The fighting in recent months has become a war of attrition, with neither side able to gain momentum over the winter and often resorting to long-range bombardment.
At least four civilians were killed and 11 were wounded in the latest Russian barrages that continued to hit civilian infrastructure, Ukraine’s presidential office said Thursday.
The Ukrainian military said Russian forces over the previous 24 hours launched 32 airstrikes, two missile strikes and 40 attacks from multiple rocket launchers.
In other developments:
— Russia’s Prosecutor General’s Office has opened an investigation into a video appearing to show the beheading of a Ukrainian serviceman that appeared online this week, according to the government department’s press service. It said it intended “to assess the reliability of these materials.” Ukraine on Wednesday also launched an investigation into what it alleged was the latest atrocity blamed on Russia since it invaded in February 2022.
— A Russian mine exploded near a generator room at one of the reactors of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Ukraine’s state nuclear operator Energoatom said. “Russian occupiers continue to turn the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant into a military base, mining the perimeter,” Energoatom wrote on Telegram. The head of the U.N.’s atomic energy agency confirmed the landmine explosion and reported one had also occurred last Saturday. Rafael Grossi of the International Atomic Energy Agency said: “At a time of growing speculation about military offensives and counteroffensives in the region, it is more important than ever to agree that a nuclear power plant should never be attacked, nor used to launch attacks from. I will not rest until this has been achieved.”
Europe’s largest nuclear plant has six reactors, all of which have been shut down over the past year. The U.N.’s atomic energy agency has been trying for months to obtain agreement between Ukraine and Russia on securing the plant, whose reactors and other equipment still require an external electricity supply to operate safety systems."
130,International,https://en.setopati.com/International/160825,"Former US President Donald Trump answered questions for nearly seven hours Thursday during his second deposition in a legal battle with New York’s attorney general over his company’s business practices, reversing an earlier decision to invoke his Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination and remain silent.
The Republican met all day with lawyers for Attorney General Letitia James, who sued Trump last year. Her lawsuit claims Trump and his family misled banks and business associates by giving them false information about his net worth and the value of assets such as hotels and golf courses.
Shortly after Trump entered the Manhattan skyscraper that houses James’ offices, his attorney, Alina Habba, said he was “not only willing but also eager to testify.”
After the deposition was finished, a lawyer for Trump’s businesses, Christopher Kise, said the former president had spent nearly seven hours “describing in detail his extraordinary business success.”
“The transactions at the center of this case were wildly profitable for the banks and for the Trump entities,” Kise said. “When the facts of this success, and not politically engineered soundbites, are out in the open, everyone will scoff at the notion any fraud took place.”
The lawsuit is unrelated to the felony criminal charges filed against Trump by the Manhattan district attorney, which led last week to his historic arraignment, the first for a former president.
James declined to answer a question about the deposition at a news conference on an unrelated matter Wednesday.
Trump previously met with James’ lawyers Aug. 10, but refused to answer all but a few procedural questions, invoking his Fifth Amendment rights more than 400 times. At the time, James had not yet brought her lawsuit and it was unclear whether questions about the way Trump valued his company would become the basis of a criminal case.
“Anyone in my position not taking the Fifth Amendment would be a fool, an absolute fool,” he said in that deposition, which was recorded on video and later released publicly. Trump predicted a “renegade” prosecutor would try to make a criminal case out of his answers, if he gave them.
“One statement or answer that is ever so slightly off, just ever so slightly, by accident, by mistake, such as it was a sunny, beautiful day, when actually it was slightly overcast, would be met by law enforcement at a level seldom seen in this country, because I’ve experienced it,” he said.
Circumstances since then have changed. The criminal charges brought by the Manhattan district attorney focused on how the company accounted internally for payments to a lawyer, Michael Cohen, for his work paying off people not to go public with stories about extramarital sexual encounters Trump said never happened.
James’ lawsuit focused on allegations that Trump lied repeatedly about his own wealth and exaggerated the value of his assets on financial statements.
In a social media post Thursday morning, Trump called the suit “ridiculous, just like all of the other Election Interference cases being brought against me.”
He raised a fist as he left his apartment at Trump Tower in the morning, arriving by motorcade at the attorney general’s office around 9:40. The two sides took a break for lunch. Trump departed in the motorcade just before 6:15 p.m. and did not stop to speak to reporters.
The lawsuit James brought is scheduled to go to trial in October. Video recordings of Trump’s depositions could potentially be played at the trial, if the lawsuit is not settled.
Thursday’s deposition was conducted in private."
131,International,https://en.setopati.com/International/160820,"Leaked U.S. intelligence documents suggesting Washington spied on South Korea have put the country’s president in a delicate situation ahead of a state visit to the U.S., the first such trip by a South Korean leader in 12 years.
The documents contain purportedly private conversations between senior South Korean officials about Ukraine, indicating that Washington may have conducted surveillance on a key Asian ally even as the two nations publicly vowed to reinforce their alliance.
Since taking office last year, conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol has put a bolstered military partnership with the United States at the heart of his foreign policy to address intensifying North Korean nuclear threats and other challenges. The April 26 summit with President Joe Biden is seen as crucial to winning a stronger U.S. security commitment and resolving grievances over the Biden administration’s economic and technology policies.
The leaked documents were posted online as part of a major U.S. intelligence breach. The papers viewed by The Associated Press indicate that South Korea’s National Security Council “grappled” with the U.S. in early March over an American request to provide artillery ammunition to Ukraine.
The documents, which cited a signals intelligence report, said then-NSC Director Kim Sung-han suggested the possibility of selling the 330,000 rounds of 155 mm munitions to Poland, since getting the ammunition to Ukraine quickly was the United States’ ultimate goal.
South Korea, a growing arms exporter, has a policy of not supplying weapons to countries at war. It has not provided arms directly to Ukraine, although it has shipped humanitarian aid and joined U.S.-led economic sanctions against Russia.
Yoon’s government said it discussed the leaked papers with the United States, and they agreed that “a considerable number” of the documents were fabricated. The South Korean government avoided any public complaints about the U.S. and did not specify which documents were faked.
“There’s no indication that the U.S., which is our ally, conducted (eavesdropping) on us with malicious intent,” Kim Tae-hyo, Seoul’s deputy national security director, told reporters Tuesday at Dulles Airport near Washington at the start of a trip aimed at preparing for the summit.
Senior Biden administration have discussed the leaks with allies at high levels and sought to reassure them of the U.S. government’s commitment to safe-guarding intelligence. The administration also sought to downplay the impact the leak would have on Yoon’s upcoming visit.
“Our commitment to the Republic of Korea remains ironclad, and President Biden looks forward to welcoming President Yoon to the White House for the upcoming state visit to discuss their shared commitment for a strong and deeply integrated U.S.-ROK Alliance that maintains peace, stability, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific and beyond,” the White House National Security Council said in a statement, using South Korea’s official name.
The Yoon government’s stance invited criticism from liberal rivals, who called on the government to lodge strong protests with the U.S. They also suspected what they call Yoon’s hasty relocation of his presidential office to a Defense Ministry compound in central Seoul may have left the office vulnerable to wiretapping.
“As a sovereign nation, we must sternly respond to the spying of state secrets, even if it was committed by an ally with whom (South Korea) has bonded over blood,” said Park Hong-geun, floor leader of the main liberal opposition Democratic Party.
In an official statement, Yoon’s office said it maintains tight security, including anti-eavesdropping systems. It called the opposition party’s attempts to link the office relocation to the spying allegation “diplomatic suicidal acts” that shake South Korea’s national interests and its alliance with the U.S.
The situation is unlikely to threaten the country’s alliance with the U.S. that was forged during the 1950-53 Korean War, many experts say.
“No big damage is expected on the Korea-U.S. alliance as it seems both governments share the view that they would focus on the alliance, more concretely on a successful state visit by Yoon,” said Bong Young-shik, an expert at Seoul’s Yonsei Institute for North Korean Studies.
If Yoon returns with some achievements, Koreans will conclude that he put up with the spying allegations “because bigger matters were at stake,” Bong said. But if the visit amounts to ”a pomp-only trip,” people could question whether South Korea “made lots of concessions.”
One possible achievement for Yoon would be if South Korea takes on a role in the management of U.S. nuclear weapons in the face of North Korea’s advancing nuclear arsenal.
Other wins would be securing U.S. benefits for major South Korean businesses involved in the making of electric vehicles and easing U.S. restrictions on technology exports to China, which has been a major manufacturing base for South Korean chipmakers.
If the U.S. intends to help Yoon, “the latest incident on the documents could end up strengthening the Korea-U.S. alliance and helping South Korea win something from the U.S,” said Kim Yeol Soo, an expert at South Korea’s Korea Institute for Military Affairs.
Kim Tae-hyung, a professor at Seoul’s Soongsil University, said the exposure of possible U.S. spying could help Seoul maintain its existing policy of not supplying weapons to Ukraine. But it’s also possible that the Yoon government reconsiders that policy now that the U.S. demands are public, Kim said.
Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, South Korea has agreed to provide billions of dollars’ worth of tanks, howitzers, fighter jets and other weapons to Poland, a NATO member.
An American official said in November that the United States had agreed to buy 100,000 artillery rounds from South Korean manufacturers to provide to Ukraine, although South Korean officials have maintained that the munitions were meant to refill depleted U.S. stocks.
Choi Jin, director of the Seoul-based Institute of Presidential Leadership, said it’s also no secret that allies spy on each other, as well as their adversaries.
The U.S. wiretapping activities “are something that everyone already knows,” although it becomes a more sensitive matter when the practice is made public, Choi said.
“I think South Koreans also try to wiretap (U.S. officials) as well,” Choi said. “People feel animosity toward the word ‘wiretapping.’ But in other words, it’s called intelligence gathering.”"
132,International,https://en.setopati.com/International/160819,"Prince Harry will attend his father’s coronation, Buckingham Palace said Wednesday, ending months of speculation about whether the prince would be welcome after leveling charges of racism and media manipulation at the royal family.
His wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, will remain at the couple’s home in Southern California with their two young children, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet, the palace said. A nearly identical statement from the Sussex’s representatives confirmed the news.
The May 6 date of the coronation at Westminster Abbey coincides with their son’s birthday.
While the announcement should silence the “will he or won’t he” debate in the British media, it won’t end the royal soap opera swirling around Harry and Meghan as King Charles III prepares for his coronation.
When the prince attended the funerals of his grandfather, Prince Philip, and his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, commentators discussed everything from whether Harry would be allowed to wear his military uniform to exactly where he was seated. And there is always the question of whether he will meet face-to-face with his father and older brother, Prince William.
That intrigue will only be heightened after Harry and Meghan stoked their critique of the royal family in a six-part Netflix series about their decision to step back from royal duties three years ago, which was followed by Harry’s decision to reveal family secrets in his bestselling memoir “Spare.”
Harry and Meghan, who is biracial, have alleged she faced racist attitudes from both the palace and the U.K. press. The treatment contributed to their decision to leave the country.
The revelations in “Spare,″ including details of private conversations with his father and brother, Prince William, fanned tensions between Harry and his family that became public when he and his wife moved to North America in 2020.
The book also included allegations that members of the royal family regularly feed the press unflattering information about other members of the House of Windsor in exchange for positive coverage of themselves.
The prince singled out Camilla, the queen consort, accusing her of leaking private conversations to the media as she sought to rehabilitate her image after marrying Charles. Camilla was once reviled for her long-term affair with Charles, which contributed to the breakdown of his marriage to the late Princess Diana, Harry and William’s mother.
The acrimony between Harry and his family once again spilled into public view last month when the Sussexes said that they had been asked to vacate their home in Britain.
Frogmore Cottage, a royal residence on the grounds of Windsor Castle west of London, was the couple’s main residence before they gave up royal duties and moved to Montecito, a wealthy enclave in Southern California."
133,International,https://en.setopati.com/International/160812,"Ukraine wants India to play a bigger role in helping end Russia’s war, its deputy foreign minister said Tuesday during the first visit by a senior Ukrainian official to India since the war began last year.
India “can play a bigger and greater role” and Ukraine would “welcome any effort that is directed at resolving the war,” Emine Dzhaparova said.
She made the comments in a speech at the Indian Council of World Affairs, a think tank in New Delhi, after meeting with her Indian counterpart, Sanjay Verma, and other officials.
Dzhaparova has sought to use her visit to deepen ties with India, which has refrained from condemning Russia’s role in the war and has abstained several times from voting on U.N. resolutions against Moscow. Instead, New Delhi has stressed the need for diplomacy and dialogue on ending the war and has expressed its willingness to contribute to peace efforts.
Dzhaparova said she hopes Indian officials including National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, who visited Moscow in February and held talks with President Vladimir Putin, will also visit Kyiv.
“We would be happy to welcome Indian officials to Kyiv,” she said.
Russian officials are expected to visit India in coming weeks for meetings of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, which the country is chairing this year.
India depends on Russia for nearly 60% of its defense equipment and has ramped up its purchases of low-priced Russian oil since the war in Ukraine began.
On Monday, Dzhaparova warned India against an over reliance on Russia.
“India should be pragmatic in diversifying its energy resources, military contracts and political interactions. Because what we see in my country when you are dependent on Russia, they will always use this blackmail instrument,” she told reporters.
India also holds the rotating presidency of the Group of 20 leading rich and developing nations this year. As host, India has cast itself as a rising superpower while leveraging its position on the global stage to bridge the gap between the West and Russia.
Dzhaparova urged India to use its presidency to spotlight the crisis in Ukraine by inviting Ukrainian officials to the G-20 events and summit, which will be held in September.
She said her visit was “a mark of friendship” and hoped it would kickstart Ukraine’s dialogue with India. “Let us make Ukraine more visible in India, let us help Ukraine to tell its own story, let us also bring India closer” to Ukraine, Dzhaparova said."
134,International,https://en.setopati.com/International/160811,"Airstrikes by Myanmar’s military on Tuesday killed as many as 100 people, including many children, who were attending a ceremony held by opponents of army rule, said a witness, a member of a local pro-democracy group and independent media.
The military is increasingly using airstrikes to counter a widespread armed struggle against its rule, which began in February 2021 when it seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi. More than 3,000 civilians are estimated to have been killed since then by security forces.
A witness told The Associated Press that a fighter jet dropped bombs directly onto a crowd of people who were gathering at 8 a.m. for the opening of a local office of the country’s opposition movement outside Pazigyi village in Sagaing region’s Kanbalu township. The area is about 110 kilometers (70 miles) north of Mandalay, the country’s second-largest city.
About half an hour later, a helicopter appeared and fired at the site, said the witness, who asked not to be identified because he feared punishment by the authorities.
Initial reports put the death toll at around 50, but later tallies reported by independent media raised it to about 100. It was impossible to independently confirm details of the attack because reporting is restricted by the military government.
“I was standing a short distance from the crowd when a friend of mine contacted me on the phone about the approach of a fighter jet,” the witness said. “The jet dropped bombs directly on the crowd, and I jumped into a nearby ditch and hid. A few moments later, when I stood up and looked around, I saw people cut to pieces and dead in the smoke. The office building was destroyed by fire. About 30 people were injured. While the wounded were being transported, a helicopter arrived and shot more people. We are now cremating the bodies quickly.”
About 150 people had gathered for the opening ceremony, and women and 20 to 30 children were among the dead, he said, adding that those killed also included leaders of locally formed anti-government armed groups and other opposition organizations.
The United Nations, United States and others strongly condemned the attack and pledged to work toward holding the military accountable.
’This heinous act by the terrorist military is yet another example of their indiscriminate use of extreme force against innocent civilians, constituting a war crime,” the opposition National Unity Government said in a statement. The NUG calls itself the country’s legitimate government, in opposition to the army. The office being opened Tuesday was part of its administrative network.
The military government’s spokesperson, Maj. Gen. Zaw Min Tun, acknowledged in a statement phoned to state television MRTV that the ceremony had been attacked, but accused anti-government forces in the area of carrying out a violent campaign of terror. He said the People’s Defense Forces — the armed wing of the National Unity Government -- had terrorized residents into supporting them, killing Buddhist monks, teachers and other people, while the military sought peace and stability. He said there was evidence the attack had set off secondary blasts of explosives hidden by the People’s Defense Forces around the site.
In response to accusations of abuses, the military government often accuses pro-democracy forces of terrorism. But analysts for the United Nations and non-governmental organizations have gathered credible evidence of large-scale human rights abuses by the army, including the burning of entire villages and displacement of more than a million people, triggering a humanitarian crisis.
The death toll from Tuesday’s air attack, if confirmed, could be the highest in more than two years of civil conflict that began when the army seized power in 2021. As many as 80 people were killed last October in another government air attack in northern Myanmar on an anniversary celebration of the Kachin ethnic minority’s main political organization, which is also battling the military government.
Myanmar has been in turmoil since the army takeover triggered widespread popular opposition. After peaceful demonstrations were put down with lethal force, many opponents of military rule took up arms, and large parts of the country are now embroiled in conflict.
The army has been conducting major offensives in the countryside, where it has faced some of the toughest resistance in Sagaing, in Myanmar’s historic heartland. The resistance forces have no defense against air attacks.
In videos of the devastated village seen by AP, survivors and onlookers stumble through the area of the attack amid clouds of thick smoke, with only the skeleton frame of one building still standing in the distance. The videos could not immediately be verified but matched other descriptions of the scene.
Some motorbikes remained intact while others were reduced to their frames or buried under tree branches. In one area, two victims lay close together, one of whom had only one arm still attached.
Another victim lay face down in a small grove by the roadside. A few meters (yards) away, a small torso missing at least one limb could be seen.
In January, Myanmar’s top leader told the military it needs to take decisive action against those opposed to army rule. Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing said at a military parade on Armed Forces Day that those who condemned his government showed indifference to violence committed by its opponents.
Resistance forces have been able to prevent the military from taking firm control of large areas of the country, but have a great disadvantage in weapons, particularly in countering air attacks.
Critics of the military government advocate banning or limiting the sale of aviation fuel to Myanmar to cripple the military’s advantage in air power. Many Western nations have imposed arms embargoes on the military government, and the United States and Britain recently enacted new sanctions targeting individuals and companies involved in supplying jet fuel to Myanmar.
The human rights group Amnesty International said in a statement Tuesday that “The relentless air attacks across Myanmar highlight the urgent need to suspend the import of aviation fuel. Amnesty reiterates its calls on all states and businesses to stop shipments that may end up in the hands of the Myanmar Air Force.”
It also urged the U.N. Security Council to “push through effective actions to hold the Myanmar military accountable, including by referring the situation in the country to the International Criminal Court.”
The United Nations said those responsible for the attack must be brought to justice, with U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric stressing that the injured must receive medical treatment, which is “often a challenge in these circumstances.” Myanmar’s government-run hospitals are short on staff and supplies, and opponents of the military avoid them for safety reasons.
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres “condemns all forms of violence and reaffirms the primacy of protection of civilians, in accordance with international humanitarian law and reiterates his call for the military to end the campaign of violence against the Myanmar population throughout the country” as called for by the U.N. Security Council in a resolution adopted last December, Dujarric said.
The U.S. would continue to work with the international community to hold the military government accountable for violations and abuses, the State Department said in a statement.
“These violent attacks further underscore the regime’s disregard for human life and its responsibility for the dire political and humanitarian crisis in Burma,” said Vedant Patel, principal deputy spokesperson at the State Department, using Myanmar’s former name."
135,International,https://en.setopati.com/International/160806,"A Louisville bank employee armed with a rifle opened fire at his workplace Monday morning, killing five people — including a close friend of Kentucky’s governor — while livestreaming the attack on Instagram, authorities said.
Police arrived as shots were still being fired inside Old National Bank and killed the shooter in an exchange of gunfire, Louisville Metro Police Department Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel said. The city’s mayor, Craig Greenberg, called the attack “an evil act of targeted violence.”
The shooting, the 15th mass killing in the country this year, comes just two weeks after a former student killed three children and three adults at a Christian elementary school in Nashville, Tennessee, about 160 miles (260 kilometers) to the south. That state’s governor and his wife also had friends killed in that shooting.
In Louisville, the chief identified the shooter as 25-year-old Connor Sturgeon, who she said was livestreaming during the attack.
“That’s tragic to know that that incident was out there and captured,” she said.
Meta, the company that owns Facebook and Instagram, said in a statement that it had “quickly removed the livestream of this tragic incident this morning.”
Social media companies have imposed tougher rules over the past few years to prohibit violent and extremist content. They have set up systems to remove posts and streams that violate those restrictions, but shocking material like the Louisville shooting continues to slip through the cracks, prompting lawmakers and other critics to lash out at the technology industry for slipshod safeguards and moderation policies.
Nine people, including two police officers, were treated for injuries from the Louisville shooting, University of Louisville Hospital spokeswoman Heather Fountaine said in an email. One of the wounded, identified as 57-year-old Deana Eckert, later died, police said Monday night.
One of the wounded officers, 26-year-old Nickolas Wilt, graduated from the police academy on March 31. He was in critical condition after being shot in the head and having surgery, the police chief said. At least three patients had been discharged.
Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said he lost one of his closest friends in the shooting — Tommy Elliott — in the building not far from the minor league ballpark Louisville Slugger Field and Waterfront Park.
“Tommy Elliott helped me build my law career, helped me become governor, gave me advice on being a good dad,” said Beshear, his voice shaking with emotion. “He’s one of the people I talked to most in the world, and very rarely were we talking about my job. He was an incredible friend.”
Also killed in the shooting were Josh Barrick, Jim Tutt and Juliana Farmer, police said.
“These are irreplaceable, amazing individuals that a terrible act of violence tore from all of us,” the governor said.
It was the second time that Beshear was personally touched by a mass tragedy since becoming governor.
In late 2021, one of the towns devastated by tornadoes that tore through Kentucky was Dawson Springs, the hometown of Beshear’s father, former two-term Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear. Andy Beshear frequently visited Dawson Springs as a boy and has talked emotionally about his father’s hometown.
Beshear spoke as the investigation in Louisville continued and police searched for a motive. Crime scene investigators could be seen marking and photographing numerous bullet holes in the windows near the bank’s front door.
As part of the investigation, police descended on the neighborhood where the suspect lived, about 5 miles (8 kilometers) south of the downtown shooting. The street was blocked as federal and local officers talked to residents. One home was cordoned off with caution tape. Kami Cooper, who lives in the neighborhood, said she didn’t recall ever meeting the suspect but said it’s an unnerving feeling to have lived on the same street as someone who could do such a thing.
“I’m almost speechless. You see it on the news but not at home,” Cooper said. “It’s unbelievable, it could happen here, somebody on my street.”
A man who fled the building during the shooting told WHAS-TV that the shooter opened fire with a long rifle in a conference room in the back of the building’s first floor.
“Whoever was next to me got shot — blood is on me from it,” he told the news station, pointing to his shirt. He said he fled to a break room and shut the door.
Deputy Police Chief Paul Humphrey said the actions of responding police officers undoubtedly saved lives.
“This is a tragic event,” he said. “But it was the heroic response of officers that made sure that no more people were more seriously injured than what happened.”
Just a few hours later and blocks away, an unrelated shooting killed one man and wounded a woman outside a community college, police said.
The 15 mass shootings this year are the most during the first 100 days of a calendar year since 2009, when 16 had occurred by April 10, according to a mass killings database maintained by The Associated Press and USA Today in partnership with Northeastern University.
Going back to 2006, the first year for which data has been compiled, the years with the most mass killings were 2019 and 2022, with 45 and 42 mass killings recorded during the entire calendar year. The pace in 2009 slowed later in the year, with 32 mass killings recorded that year."
136,International,https://en.setopati.com/International/160799,"China’s military sent several dozen warplanes and warships toward Taiwan in a large-scale exercise that simulated sealing off the island in response to its president’s trip to the U.S.
The Chinese military earlier had announced three-day “combat readiness patrols” which it called Joint Sword, as a warning to Taiwan, a self-ruled island which China claims as its own. Beijing says contact between foreign officials and the island’s democratic government encourages Taiwanese who want formal independence, a step China’s ruling Communist Party says would lead to war.
The sides split in 1949 after a civil war, and the ruling party says the island is obliged to rejoin the mainland, by force if necessary. Military analysts suggest that in the event of a war, China may block sea and air traffic around Taiwan, preventing the United States, Japan or other nations from intervening or sending supplies to help the island defend itself.
China’s latest military actions follow President Tsai Ing-wen’s delicate diplomatic mission to shore up Taiwan’s dwindling alliances in Central America and boost its U.S. support, a trip capped with a sensitive meeting with U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in California. A U.S. congressional delegation also met with Tsai over the weekend in Taiwan after she returned.
China responded to the McCarthy meeting by imposing a travel ban and financial sanctions against those associated with Tsai’s U.S. trip and with increased military activity through the weekend.
On Monday morning, the Chinese People’s Liberation Army said its Shandong aircraft carrier for the first time was taking part in the exercises encircling Taiwan. It showed a video of a fighter jet taking off the deck of the ship, according to a post from the PLA’s Eastern Command on Weibo, the social media platform.
State broadcaster CCTV, citing the PLA, said the exercises are “simulating the joint sealing off” of Taiwan as well as “waves of simulated strikes” at important targets on the island.
Between 6 a.m. Sunday and 6 a.m. Monday, a total of 70 planes were detected and half crossed the median of the Taiwan Strait, an unofficial boundary once tacitly accepted by both sides, according to Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense. Among the planes that crossed the median were 8 J-16 fighter jets, 4 J-1 fighters, 8 Su-30 fighters and reconnaissance planes.
Later Monday morning, Taiwan’s defense ministry reported another 59 flights by bombers, as well as multiple fighter jets.
That followed a full day between Friday and Saturday, where eight warships and 71 planes were detected near Taiwan, according to the island’s Defense Ministry. The ministry said in a statement it was approaching the situation from the perspective of “not escalating conflict, and not causing disputes.”
Taiwan said it monitored the Chinese moves through its land-based missile systems, as well as on its own navy vessels.
China’s military harassment of Taiwan has intensified in recent years with planes or ships sent toward the island on a near-daily basis, with the numbers rising in reaction to sensitive activities.
In addition to combat readiness patrols, China’s PLA would hold “live fire training” in Luoyuan Bay in China’s Fujian province opposite Taiwan, the local Maritime Authority announced over the weekend.
Meanwhile, to the south in the South China Sea, the U.S. 7th Fleet said its missile destroyer USS Milius sailed by Mischief Reef in a freedom of navigation operation. China had built an artificial island on the sea feature to stake its claim to the disputed territory.
China said the U.S. “illegally trespassed” into waters near the reef without the permission of the Chinese government, according to a statement from the Chinese military’s southern command.
One of the U.S. representatives who attended the meeting with Tsai last week said Saturday the U.S. must take seriously the threat China posed to Taiwan. Republican Mike Gallagher, chairman of the U.S. House Select Committee on China, told The Associated Press that he plans to lead his committee in working to shore up the island government’s defenses, encouraging Congress to expedite military aid to Taiwan."
137,International,https://en.setopati.com/International/160797,"It was a celebratory atmosphere for officials gathered just hours away from several of India’s major tiger reserves in the southern city of Mysuru, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced Sunday to much applause that the country’s tiger population has steadily grown to over 3,000 since its flagship conservation program began 50 years ago after concerns that numbers of the big cats were dwindling.
“India is a country where protecting nature is part of our culture,” Modi proclaimed. “This is why we have many unique achievements in wildlife conservation.”
Modi also launched the International Big Cats Alliance that he said will focus on the protection and conservation of seven big cat species, namely, the tiger, lion, leopard, snow leopard, puma, jaguar and cheetah.
Protesters, meanwhile, are telling their own stories Sunday of how they have been displaced by wildlife conservation projects over the last half-century, with dozens demonstrating about an hour away from the announcement.
Project Tiger began in 1973 after a census of the big cats found India’s tigers were fast going extinct through habitat loss, unregulated sport hunting, increased poaching and retaliatory killing by people. It’s believed the tiger population was around 1,800 at the time, but experts widely consider that an overestimate due to imprecise counting methods in India until 2006. Laws attempted to address the decline, but the conservation model centered around creating protected reserves where ecosystems can function undisturbed by people.
Several Indigenous groups say the conservation strategies, deeply influenced by American environmentalism, meant uprooting numerous communities that had lived in the forests for millennia.
Members of several Indigenous or Adivasi groups — as Indigenous people are known in the country — set up the Nagarahole Adivasi Forest Rights Establishment Committee to protest evictions from their ancestral lands and seek a voice in how the forests are managed.
“Nagarahole was one of the first forests to be brought under Project Tiger and our parents and grandparents were probably among the first to be forced out of the forests in the name of conservation,” said J. A. Shivu, 27, who belongs to the Jenu Kuruba tribe. “We have lost all rights to visit our lands, temples or even collect honey from the forests. How can we continue living like this?”
Jenu, which means honey in the southern Indian Kannada language, is the tribe’s primary source of livelihood as they collect it from beehives in the forests to sell.
The fewer than 40,000 Jenu Kuruba people are one of the 75 tribal groups that the Indian government classifies as particularly vulnerable. Adivasi communities like the Jenu Kurubas are among the poorest in India.
Some experts say conservation policies that attempted to protect a pristine wilderness were influenced by prejudices against local communities.
The Indian government’s tribal affairs ministry has repeatedly said it is working on Adivasi rights. Only about 1% of the more than 100 million Adivasis in India have been granted any rights over forest lands despite a government forest rights law, passed in 2006, that aimed to “undo the historical injustice” for forest communities.
India’s tiger numbers, meanwhile, are thriving: the country’s 3,167 tigers account for more than 75% of the world’s wild tiger population.
Tigers have disappeared in Bali and Java and China’s tigers are likely extinct in the wild. The Sunda Island tiger, the other sub-species, is only found in Sumatra. India’s project to safeguard them has been praised as a success by many.
“Project Tiger hardly has a parallel in the world since a scheme of this scale and magnitude has not been so successful elsewhere,” said SP Yadav, a senior Indian government official in charge of Project Tiger.
But critics say the social costs of fortress conservation — where forest departments protect wildlife and prevent local communities from entering forest regions — is high.
Sharachchandra Lele, of the Bengaluru-based Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment, said the conservation model is outdated.
“There are already several examples of forests used actively by local communities and tiger numbers have actually increased even while people have benefited in these regions,” he said.
Vidya Athreya, the director of Wildlife Conservation Society in India who has been studying the interactions between large cats and humans for the last two decades, agreed.
“Traditionally we always put wildlife over people,” Athreya said, adding that engaging with communities is the way forward for protecting wildlife in India.
Shivu, from the Jenu Kuruba tribe, also wants to go back to a life where Indigenous communities and tigers lived together.
“We consider them gods and us the custodians of these forests,” he said."
138,International,https://en.setopati.com/International/160790,"Afghan religious scholars Saturday criticized a ban on female education, as a key Taliban minister warned clerics not to rebel against the government on the controversial issue.
Girls cannot go to school beyond sixth grade in Afghanistan, with the education ban extending to universities. Women are barred from public spaces, including parks, and most forms of employment. Last week, Afghan women were barred from working at the U.N., according to the global body, although the Taliban have yet to make a public announcement.
Authorities present the education restrictions as temporary suspensions rather than bans, but universities and schools reopened in March without their female students.
The bans have raised fierce international uproar, increasing the country’s isolation at a time when its economy has collapsed and worsenied a humanitarian crisis.
Two religious scholars who are well-known within Afghanistan said Saturday that authorities should reconsider their decision. Public opposition to Taliban policies is rare, although some Taliban leaders have voiced their disagreement with the decision-making process.
One scholar, Abdul Rahman Abid, said institutions should be permitted to re-admit girls and women through separate classes, hiring female teachers, staggering timetables, and even building new facilities.
Knowledge is obligatory in Islam for men and women, he told The Associated Press, and Islam allows women to study.
“My daughter is absent from school, I am ashamed, I have no answer for my daughter,” he said. “My daughter asks why girls are not allowed to learn in the Islamic system. I have no answer for her.”
He said reform is needed and warned that any delays are at the expense of the global Islamic community and also weakens the government.
Another scholar, who is a member of the Taliban, told the AP there is still time for ministries to solve the problem of girls’ education. Toryali Himat cited ministries comprising the inner circle of the supreme leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada, who is based in Kandahar.
It was on his orders that the government banned girls from classrooms. Himat said there are two types of criticism, one that destroys the system and another that makes corrective criticism.
“Islam has allowed both men and women to learn, but hijab and curriculum should be considered,” said Himat. “Corrective criticism should be given and the Islamic emirate should think about this. Where there is no criticism, there is the possibility of corruption. My personal opinion is that girls should get education up to university level.”
Acting Higher Education Minister Nida Mohammad Nadim said Friday that clerics should not speak against government policy.
He made his remarks after another scholar, Abdul Sami Al Ghaznawi, told students at a religious school that there was no conflict over girls’ education. He said Islamic scripture was clear that girls’ education was acceptable. Al Ghaznawi was not immediately available for comment.
Nadim appeared to target Al Ghaznawi by mentioning “an honorable scholar” at the top of a video statement released on social media.
“You encouraged the people to rebel, so what is the result?” Nadim said. “The result is that rebellion against this (ban) is allowed. If people are encouraged to rebel against the system, will it benefit Muslims?”
The minister was not immediately available for comment. But his spokesman, Hafiz Ziaullah Hashimi, confirmed Nadim’s remarks without giving further details about who they were directed at or the reason behind them."
139,International,https://en.setopati.com/International/160789,"Chinese health officials defended their search for the source of the COVID-19 virus and lashed out Saturday at the World Health Organization after its leader said Beijing should have shared genetic information earlier.
The WHO comments were “offensive and disrespectful,” said the director of the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shen Hongbing. He accused the WHO of “attempting to smear China” and said it should avoid helping others “politicize COVID-19.”
The global health body’s director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said March 17 that newly disclosed genetic material gathered in Wuhan in central China, where the first cases were detected in late 2019, “should have been shared three years ago.”
“As a responsible country and as scientists, we have always actively shared research results with scientists from around the world,” Shen said at a news conference.
The origins of COVID-19 are still debated and the focus of bitter political dispute.
Many scientists believe it jumped from animals to humans at a market in Wuhan, but the city also is home to laboratories including China’s top facility for collecting viruses. That prompted suggestions COVID-19 might have leaked from one.
The ruling Communist Party has tried to deflect criticism of its handling of the outbreak by spreading uncertainty about its origins.
Officials have repeated anti-U.S. conspiracy theories that the virus was created by Washington and smuggled into China. The government also says the virus might have entered China on mail or food shipments, though scientists abroad see no evidence to support that.
Chinese officials suppressed information about the Wuhan outbreak in 2019 and punished a doctor who warned others about the new disease. The ruling party reversed course in early 2020 and shut down access to major cities and most international travel to contain the disease.
The genetic material cited by the WHO’s Tedros was uploaded recently to a global database but collected in 2020 at a Wuhan market where wildlife was sold.
The samples show DNA from raccoon dogs mingled with the virus, scientists say. They say that adds evidence to the hypothesis COVID-19 came from animals, not a lab, but doesn’t resolve the question of where it started. They say the virus also might have spread to raccoon dogs from humans.
The information was removed by Chinese officials from the database after foreign scientists asked the CDC about it, but it had been copied by a French expert and shared with researchers outside China.
A CDC researcher, Zhou Lei, who worked in Wuhan, said Chinese scientists “shared all the data we had” and “adhered to principles of openness, objectivity and transparency.”
Shen said scientists investigated the possibility of a laboratory leak and “fully shared our research and data without any concealment or reservation.”
Shen said the source of COVID-19 had yet to be found, but he noted it took years to identify the AIDS virus and its origin still is unclear.
“Some forces and figures who instigate and participate in politicizing the traceability issue and attempting to smear China should not assume that the vision of the scientific community around the world will be blinded by their clumsy manipulation,” Shen said."
140,International,https://en.setopati.com/International/160783,"Israel launched rare strikes in southern Lebanon early Friday and pressed on with bombing targets in the Gaza Strip, marking a widening escalation in the region following violence this week at Jerusalem’s most sensitive holy site.
The cross-border fighting erupted during a time of heightened religious fervor — when Jews are celebrating the Passover holiday and Muslims are marking the Ramadan holy month. In 2021, an escalation also triggered by clashes at Jerusalem’s Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, spilled over into an 11-day war between Israel and Gaza’s Hamas rulers.
Friday’s strikes in southern Lebanon came a day after militants fired nearly three dozen rockets from there at Israel, wounding two people and causing some property damage. The Israeli military said it targeted installations of Hamas, the Palestinian militant group, in southern Lebanon.
Associated Press correspondents in the area said several missiles fired by Israeli warplanes struck an open field in the town of Qalili near the Palestinian refugee camp of Rashidiyeh, close to the coastal southern city of Tyre, while others struck a bridge and power transformer in the nearby town of Maaliya and a farm on the outskirts of Rashidiyeh, killing several sheep. No human deaths were reported.
Israeli strikes in Lebanon risk drawing Lebanon’s Hezbollah militia into the fighting, which could lead to war. The Iran-backed group, armed with thousands of rockets and missiles, holds sway over much of southern Lebanon and is viewed by Israel as a bitter foe.
The Israeli military was careful to note in its announcement about Friday’s attack that it was targeting only sites linked to Palestinian militants. In recent years, Hezbollah has stayed out of other flareups related to the Al-Aqsa Mosque, which stands on a hilltop revered by Muslims and Jews.
In Jerusalem before dawn prayers on Friday, violence erupted again at the hilltop compound as Israeli police stationed at one of the gates forcibly dispersed vast crowds of worshippers who chanted praise for Hamas while pushing their way into the limestone courtyard. Videos from the scene showed police beating large groups of Palestinian men with sticks until they stumbled backward, falling and knocking down vendors’ tables.
The head of the U.N. peacekeeping force in Lebanon, Maj. Gen. Aroldo Lázaro, said he was in contact with Israeli and Lebanese authorities early Friday. The force, known as UNIFIL, said that both sides have said they do not want war.
Meanwhile, Israeli air strikes on Gaza resumed early Friday, after militants fired more rockets from the blockaded territory, setting off air raid sirens in the Israeli coastal city of Ashkelon. The military said targets included the entry shaft to an underground network used for weapons manufacturing.
The current round of violence began Wednesday after Israeli police twice raided the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem’s Old City. That led Thursday to rocket fire from Gaza and, in a significant escalation, the rocket barrage from Lebanon.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened his Security Cabinet for a three-hour meeting late Thursday. “Israel’s response, tonight and beyond, will extract a heavy price from our enemies,” he said in a statement after the meeting.
Almost immediately, Palestinian militants in Gaza began firing rockets into southern Israel, setting off air raid sirens across the region. Loud explosions could be heard in Gaza from the Israeli strikes, as outgoing rockets whooshed into the skies toward Israel. For now, Palestinian militants have fired only short-range rockets from Gaza, rather than the long-range projectiles that can reach as far as Tel Aviv and typically invite harsher Israeli retaliation.
The Israeli military said the rocket fire on its northern and southern fronts was carried out by Palestinian militants in connection to this week’s violence at Al-Aqsa where Israeli police stormed into the building with tear gas and stun grenades to confront Palestinians barricaded inside on two straight days. The violent scenes from the mosque ratcheted up tensions across the region.
In a briefing with reporters, Lt. Col. Richard Hecht, an Israeli military spokesman, said the army drew a clear connection between the Lebanese rocket fire and the recent unrest in Jerusalem.
“It’s a Palestinian-oriented event,” he said, adding that either the Hamas or Islamic Jihad militant groups, which are based in Gaza but also operate in Lebanon, could be involved. But he said the army believed that Hezbollah and the Lebanese government were aware of what happened and also held responsibility.
The mosque — the third-holiest site in Islam — stands on a hilltop revered by Jews as the Temple Mount, the holiest site in Judaism. The competing claims to the site have repeatedly spilled over into violence over the years.
No faction in Lebanon claimed responsibility for the salvo of rockets. A Lebanese security official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to media, said the country’s security forces believed the rockets were launched by a Lebanon-based Palestinian militant group, not by Hezbollah.
Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, condemned the firing of rockets from Lebanon, adding that Lebanese troops and U.N. peacekeepers were investigating and trying to find the perpetrators. Mikati said his government “categorically rejects any military escalation” and the use of Lebanese territories to stage acts that threaten stability.
Hezbollah has condemned the Israeli police raids in Jerusalem. Both Israel and Hezbollah have avoided an all-out conflict since a 34-day war in 2006 ended in a draw.
The current escalation comes against the backdrop of Netanyahu’s domestic problems. For the past three months, hundreds of thousands of Israelis have been demonstrating against his plans to overhaul the country’s judicial system, claiming it will lead the country toward authoritarianism.
Key military units, including fighter pilots, have threatened to stop reporting for duty if the overhaul is passed, drawing a warning from Defense Minister Yoav Gallant that Israel’s national security could be harmed by the divisive plan. Netanyahu said he was firing Gallant, but then backtracked as he put the overhaul on hold for several weeks. Critics could also accuse him of trying to use the crisis to divert attention from his domestic woes.
Netanyahu said that the domestic divisions had no impact on national security and that the country would remain united in the face of external threats.
Tensions have simmered along the Lebanese border as Israel appears to have ratcheted up its shadow war against Iranian-linked targets in Syria, another close ally of Iran, Israel’s archenemy in the region.
Suspected Israeli airstrikes in Syria in recent weeks have killed two Iranian military advisers and temporarily put the country’s two largest airports out of service. Hecht, the military spokesman, said Thursday’s rocket fire was not believed to be connected to events in Syria.
In Washington, the principal deputy State Department spokesman, Vedant Patel, said, “Israel has legitimate security concerns and has every right to defend themselves.”
But he also urged calm in Jerusalem, saying that “any unilateral action that jeopardizes the status quo to us is unacceptable,” he said.
In Jerusalem, the situation remained tense at Al-Aqsa. For the previous two nights, Palestinians barricaded themselves in the mosque with stones and firecrackers.
Worshippers have been demanding the right to pray overnight inside the mosque — which authorities typically only permit during the last 10 days of the monthlong Ramadan holiday. They also have stayed in the mosque in protest over threats by religious Jews to carry out a ritual animal slaughter at the sacred site for Passover.
Israel did not try to prevent people from spending the night in the mosque early Friday — apparently because it was the weekend, when Jews do not visit the compound. But tensions could re-ignite Sunday when Jewish visits resume.
Israel bars ritual slaughter on the site, but calls by Jewish extremists to revive the practice, including offers of cash rewards to anyone who even attempts to bring an animal into the compound, have amplified fears among Muslims that Israel is plotting to take over the site
In this week’s violence, Israeli police fired stun grenades and rubber bullets to evict worshippers who had locked the doors of the building. Palestinians hurled stones and fireworks at officers. After a few hours of scuffles that left a trail of damage, police managed to drag everyone out of the compound.
Police fiercely beat Palestinians and arrested over 400 people. Israeli authorities control access to the area but the compound is administered by Islamic and Jordanian officials.
The violence at the site has resonated across the region, with condemnations pouring in from Muslim leaders."
141,International,https://en.setopati.com/International/160782,"Chinese leader Xi Jinping called Thursday for peace talks over Ukraine after French President Emmanuel Macron appealed to him to “bring Russia to its senses,” but Xi gave no indication Beijing would use its leverage as Vladimir Putin’s diplomatic partner to press for a settlement.
Xi gave no sign China, which declared it had a “no limits friendship” with Moscow before last year’s invasion, had changed its stance since calling for peace talks in February.
“Peace talks should resume as soon as possible,” Xi said. He called on other governments to avoid doing anything that might “make the crisis deteriorate or even get out of control.”
Beijing, which sees Moscow as a partner in opposing U.S. domination of global affairs, has tried to appear neutral in the conflict but has given Putin diplomatic support and repeated Russian justifications for the February 2022 attack. Xi received an effusive welcome from Putin when he visited Moscow last month, giving the isolated Russian president a political boost.
The Chinese leader said “legitimate security concerns of all parties” should be considered, a reference to Moscow’s argument that it attacked Ukraine because of the eastward expansion of NATO, the U.S.-European military alliance.
During talks earlier, Macron appealed to Xi to “bring Russia to its senses and bring everyone back to the negotiating table.”
Macron pointed to Chinese support for the United Nations Charter, which calls for respect of a country’s territorial integrity. He said Putin’s announcement of plans to deploy nuclear weapons in Belarus violated international agreements and commitments to Xi’s government.
“We need to find a lasting peace,” the French president said. “I believe that this is also an important issue for China.”
Macron was accompanied to Beijing by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in a show of European unity.
Von der Leyen said she encouraged Xi to call Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and the Chinese leader “reiterated his willingness to speak when conditions and time are right.”
“I think this is a positive element,” von der Leyen said.
Von der Leyen warned China against sending military equipment to Russia, echoing a warning Wednesday by NATO’s 31 member governments of “severe consequences” for shipments of weapons or ammunition.
“Arming the aggressor is a clear violation of international law,” von der Leyen said. “This would indeed significantly harm the relationship between the European Union and China.”
China is the biggest buyer of Russian oil and gas, which helps prop up the Kremlin’s revenue in the face of Western sanctions. That increases Chinese influence, but Xi appears reluctant to jeopardize that partnership by pressuring Putin.
“China has always adhered to an objective and fair position on the issue of the Ukraine crisis,” said a Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Mao Ning. “We have been an advocate of a political solution to the crisis and a promoter of peace talks.”
Also Wednesday, the French and Chinese governments announced agreements including the purchase of 160 Airbus aircraft by a Chinese leasing company and for their companies to collaborate on nuclear, solar, wind power and biofuel development."
142,International,https://en.setopati.com/International/160777,"Iran’s semiofficial news agency ISNA reported Thursday that Saudi Arabia and Iran agreed to reopen diplomatic missions in their respective capitals and in additional cities. There was no immediate official confirmation of the report.
As part of the reported deal, the two sides would also study the prospects of resuming flights between the two nations and facilitating the visa process for the citizens of both countries. Saudi Arabia and Iran are longtime regional rivals, but have moved toward reconciliation as part of a deal brokered by China last month.
If confirmed, the agreement would represent a new step toward reconciliation after seven years of tension. The rapprochement, which was initiated last month, lowers the chance of armed conflict between the Mideast rivals – both directly and in proxy conflicts around the region.
The initial reconciliation agreement was brokered by Beijing in March.
It represents a major diplomatic victory for the Chinese as Gulf Arab states perceive the United States slowly withdrawing from the wider Middle East. It also comes as diplomats have been trying to end a long war in Yemen, a conflict in which both Iran and Saudi Arabia are deeply entrenched.
On Thursday morning, Saudi Arabia’s state-run Al-Ekhbariya TV showed Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud and his Iranian counterpart, Hossein Amirabdollahian, shaking hands and sitting side by side. Iran’s state TV said the two ministers met to discuss the details of reopening embassies.
It was the first formal meeting of senior diplomats from the two nations since 2016, when the kingdom broke ties with Iran after protesters invaded Saudi diplomatic posts there. Saudi Arabia had executed a prominent Shiite cleric with 46 others days earlier, triggering the demonstrations."
143,International,https://en.setopati.com/International/160776,"French President Emmanuel Macron said Wednesday he wants to “engage China toward a shared responsibility for peace” in Ukraine when he meets Chinese leader Xi Jinping this week.
French officials said earlier that Macron planned to urge Xi in talks Thursday to use Beijing’s influence with Russian President Vladimir Putin, but didn’t expect a big shift in the Chinese position.
Macron is to be accompanied by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in a show of European unity in dealings with Beijing.
Xi and Putin declared their governments had a “no limits friendship” before Moscow’s February 2022 attack on Ukraine. Beijing has refused to criticize the Kremlin but has tried to appear neutral and has called for a cease-fire and peace talks.
In a speech to French residents of China, Macron said he would “try to build, and somehow engage China toward a shared responsibility for peace and stability on international issues” including Ukraine, Iran and North Korea.
Macron expressed hope China will “participate in initiatives that are useful to the Ukrainian people.”
“Dialogue with China is indispensable,” Macron said during the event at the French Embassy.
Xi’s government sees Russia as a source of energy and as a partner in opposing what both say is U.S. domination of global affairs.
China is the biggest buyer of Russian oil and gas, which helps to prop up the Kremlin’s revenue in the face of Western sanctions. That increases Chinese influence, but Xi appears reluctant to jeopardize that partnership by pressuring Putin.
Macron noted Putin’s announcement that Moscow plans to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, which China opposes.
“Territorial integrity, the sovereignty of nations is part” of the Charter of the United Nations, which China affirmed, Macron said.
Defending those principles “means moving forward together and trying to find a path for peace,” Macron said. He noted China proposed a peace plan in February and that while France doesn’t fully agree with it, the plan “shows a will to commit toward the resolution of the conflict.”
Meanwhile, NATO’s 31 member countries warned Wednesday of “severe consequences” should China start sending weapons and ammunition to Russia.
“Allies have been clear that any provision of lethal aid by China to Russia would be a historic mistake, with profound implications,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters after chairing a meeting of the organization’s foreign ministers in Brussels.
Stoltenberg declined to say what the implications of such a move might be, but warned only that it would involve “severe consequences.”
“At a time when Beijing and Moscow are pushing back against the rules-based international order, it is even more important that we continue to stand together,” he said.
Last week, von der Leyen warned the European Union must be prepared to develop measures to protect trade and investment that China might exploit for its own security and military purposes.
Thierry Breton, EU commissioner for internal market, said Monday on French news broadcaster FranceInfo the message to Chinese authorities is that they “must stop trying to play one country against another.”
Macron also said “several major deals” were due to be signed between French and Chinese companies during the visit. He was accompanied by more than 50 French CEOs including from Airbus, railway equipment manufacturer Alstom and energy giant EDF.
A French official said last week negotiations were underway on a potential deal with Airbus that would come on top of China’s 2019 order for 300 aircraft.
Macron said he will push for “working in partnership” with China on climate. He said France will organize a global conference on the protection of oceans in 2025 and said China should be part of these efforts."
144,International,https://en.setopati.com/International/160775,"A man with a hatchet burst into a day care center Wednesday in Brazil, killing four children, authorities said, in an attack that shook the country and put pressure on the government to curb a rising tide of violence.
At least four other children were wounded in the attack in Blumenau, a city of 366,000 in southern Brazil, near the Atlantic coast.
The assailant, who got inside by jumping over a wall, turned himself in at a police station, officials said. He did not appear to have any connection with the center, which offers nursery services, preschool education and after-school activities. The dead were between the ages of 5 and 7, authorities said.
Authorities were searching for a motive, the police detective leading the investigation, Ronnie Esteves, told television reporters.
Hours after the attack, the justice and education ministers pledged to invest in new violence-prevention efforts.
Valeria Aparecida Camilo, the mother of 5-year-old girl at the center, said she was working when a colleague saw the news. She called her husband, Gustavo, who rushed to the school and later learned that his daughter had survived.
“The moment I saw her, it was a relief,” Gustavo Camilo told The Associated Press outside the center. “But we feel sorry for everything that has happened, with the other kids who wound up dying.”
“They have no cruelty, they’re kids,” Valeria added. “They’re 5 years old. What did a 5-year-old do to this person?”
Franciele Chequeto said one of the girls killed was friends with her 7-year-old son, Gabriel.
“He wasn’t understanding,” Chequeto said. “I sat down and told him that he no longer will be able to see some of his little friends.”
The state’s civil police chief, Ulisses Gabriel, confirmed that the attacker was a 25-year-old man from neighboring Parana state. He will be charged with murder and attempted murder. Police believe the attack was an isolated act and not related to any other crimes, Gabriel said.
Images broadcast on networks showed weeping parents outside the private day care center called Cantinho do Bom Pastor.
The attack took place on the center’s playground, according to the local affiliate of television network Globo. NSC, the affiliate, showed a photo of the suspect with a closely shaved head. Police have yet to confirm his identity.
Blumenau’s mayor, Mário Hildebrandt, suspended classes and said he will declare a 30-day mourning period. Authorities said any reports of other attacks or threats against schools in the region were false.
School attacks in Brazil have happened with greater frequency in recent years. Last week, a student in Sao Paulo fatally stabbed a teacher and wounded several others in Sao Paulo.
Brazil has seen at least one past attack on a day care center. That attack also occurred in Santa Catarina state, in May 2021, when an assailant used a dagger to kill three children under 2 years old and two adults.
From 2000 to 2022, 16 attacks or violent episodes happened in schools, four of them in the second half of last year, according to a report from researchers led by Daniel Cara, an education professor at the University of Sao Paulo. The 12 researchers — comprised of psychologists, social scientists, public school educators, journalists and activists — prepared the report for the government of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
Brazilian Justice Minister Flávio Dino told reporters in Brasilia that he was directing 150 million reais ($30 million) from the nation’s public security fund to shore up school safety. That money will pay for both heightened policing and an expansion of a Brasilia-based team for the monitoring of deep-web communities, he said. Earlier Wednesday, Dino met with representatives from student associations.
Meanwhile, Education Minister Camilo Santana announced the creation of a group to address school violence. Santana will lead the group, which is scheduled to meet for the first time Thursday.
There is no single factor to explain the rise of such attacks, but a common denominator is what Cara calls “a crisis of perspective” regarding economic problems and the likelihood that each assailant endured situations of frustration and violence, including bullying and harassment.
“Given the lack of perspective and the way they were victimized,” they get recruited by online communities and seek a way to take revenge on society, Cara told the AP by phone.
“They are usually young people who have a masculinist, misogynistic, racist discourse, who worship neo-Nazi and fascist symbols, and who navigate in communities where violence is glorified,” Cara added.
Experts say April is a particularly sensitive month for school attacks as it concentrates the anniversaries of the 1999 Columbine school shooting in the U.S. and a shooting in a school in Rio de Janeiro’s metropolitan area in 2011. These events are glorified in violent communities and can act as triggers for new attacks, Cara said.
“There are no words to console the families. Anyone who has lost a relative knows that there are no words,” a teary-eyed President Lula said Wednesday at the outset of a ministerial meeting. He requested his ministers observe a minute of silence.
In 2019, a bacterial infection claimed the life of Lula’s grandson, who was 7 years old — the same age as one of the victims in Blumenau."
145,International,https://en.setopati.com/International/160764,"Donald Trump conspired to undermine the 2016 election through a series of hush money payments designed to stifle claims that could be harmful to his candidacy, prosecutors said Tuesday in unsealing a historic 34-count felony indictment against the former president.
Trump, stone-faced and silent as he entered and exited the Manhattan courtroom, said “not guilty” in a firm voice while facing a judge who warned him to refrain from rhetoric that could inflame or cause civil unrest.
The broad contours of the case have long been known, but the 16-page indictment contains new details about a scheme that prosecutors say involved multiple payoffs to two women, including a porn star, who said they had extramarital sexual encounters with him years earlier, as well as to a Trump Tower doorman who claimed to have a story about a child he alleged the former president had out of of wedlock.
The arraignment, though largely procedural in nature, amounts to a remarkable reckoning for Trump after years of investigations into his personal, business and political dealings. The case is unfolding against the backdrop not only of his third campaign for the White House but also against other investigations in Washington and Atlanta that might yet produce even more charges.
Trump, his lips pursed in apparent anger, entered the courtroom shortly before 2:30 p.m. He left court about an hour later, also without commenting. All told, the voluble Trump spoke only about 10 words during the entire proceeding.
Before the arraignment, he narrated his feelings in real time, describing the experience as “SURREAL” as he traveled from Trump Tower to lower Manhattan to face a judge.
It represents the new split-screen reality for Trump as he submits to the dour demands of the American criminal justice system while projecting an aura of defiance and victimhood at celebratory campaign events.
Wearing his signature dark suit and red tie, Trump turned and waved to crowds outside the building before heading inside to be fingerprinted and processed. He arrived at court in an eight-car motorcade from Trump Tower, communicating in real time his anger at the process.
“Heading to Lower Manhattan, the Courthouse,” he posted on his Truth Social platform. “Seems so SURREAL — WOW, they are going to ARREST ME. Can’t believe this is happening in America. MAGA!”
Trump, who was impeached twice by the U.S. House but was never convicted in the U.S. Senate, is the first former president to face criminal charges. The nation’s 45th commander in chief was escorted from Trump Tower to the courthouse by the Secret Service.
“He is strong and ready to go,” Trump lawyer Joe Tacopina told The Associated Press. Earlier, Tacopina said in a TV interview that the former president wouldn’t plead guilty to lesser charges, even if it might resolve the case. He also said he didn’t think the case would make it to a jury.
New York police said they were ready for large protests by Trump supporters, who share the Republican former president’s belief that the New York grand jury indictment and three additional pending investigations are politically motivated and intended to weaken his bid to retake the White House in 2024. Journalists often outnumbered protesters, though.
Trump, a former reality TV star, has been hyping that narrative to his political advantage, saying he raised more than $8 million in the days since the indictment on claims of a “witch hunt.” His campaign released a fundraising request titled “My last email before arrest” and he has repeatedly assailed Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, egged on supporters to protest and claimed without evidence that the judge presiding over the case “hates me” — something his own lawyer has said is not true.
Trump was scheduled to return to his Palm Beach, Florida, home, Mar-a-Lago, on Tuesday evening to give remarks. At least 500 prominent supporters have been invited, with some of the most pro-Trump congressional Republicans expected to attend.
A conviction would not prevent Trump from running for or winning the presidency in 2024.
The investigation is scrutinizing six-figure payments made to porn actor Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal. Both say they had sexual encounters with the married Trump years before he got into politics. Trump denies having sexual liaisons with either woman and has denied any wrongdoing involving payments.
The arraignment unfolded against the backdrop of heavy security in New York, coming more than two years after Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol in a failed bid to halt the congressional certification of Democrat Joe Biden’s win.
Trump was defiant ahead of his arraignment. He used his social media network to complain that he was going to court in a heavily Democratic area, declaring, “KANGAROO COURT” and “THIS IS NOT WHAT AMERICA WAS SUPPOSED TO BE!” He and his campaign have repeatedly assailed Bragg and even trained scrutiny on members of Bragg’s family.
Despite that, the scenes around Trump Tower and the courthouse where Trump will stand before a judge did not feature major unrest. Police tried to keep apart protesters supporting the former president and those opposing him by confining them to separate sides of a park near the courthouse using metal barricades.
Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, one of Trump’s staunchest supporters in Congress, staged a brief rally at the park, but the scene was so chaotic that it was hard to hear her over the crush of reporters and protesters.
“We’re the party of peace,” Greene said, thanking those Trump supporters present. “Democrats are communists.”
Embattled Republican New York Rep. George Santos also showed up in solidarity with Trump, saying, “I want to support the president.”
“I think this is unprecedented and it’s a bad day for democracy,” Santos said, suggesting that future prosecutors could target Biden and other presidents with other cases, which “cheapens the judicial system.”
New York’s ability to carry out safe and drama-free courthouse proceedings in a case involving a polarizing ex-president could be an important test case as prosecutors in Atlanta and Washington conduct their own investigations of Trump that could also result in charges. Those investigations concern efforts to undo the 2020 election results as well as the possible mishandling of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago."
