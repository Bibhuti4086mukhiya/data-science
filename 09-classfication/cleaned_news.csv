outlined agreed thereby creating confusion lack ownership implementation polices require engagement several interministerial institutions Policies brought one ministry responsibilities implementation another ministry one main reasons dysfunction Legal provisions Several policy provisions demand legal back successful implementation polices prepared without proper assessment legal situation existing law inhibit implementation new law required implement policy etc Hence policy formulated many existing laws prohibit eg forest law park people law implementation new laws required situation must assessed making policy clear legal provisions required implement specific policy must outlined policy unlike laws provision punishment concerned officials fails implement particular policy resulting impunity lack implementation Coordination Lack interministerial interagency coordination another big barrier implementing policy effectively scope policies eg agriculture policy urban development

claim appetite maximizing happiness impacts ecological collapse puts existence future generations planet greater risk also compromises ability future generations meet needs without strife needless sufferings Besides age hyperconsumerism placed habits happiness shallow myth can’t happy without mindlessly decided overlook bitter truth many happiness choices detrimental ecology sustainability Similarly search happiness unethical stifle undermine happiness others selfish fulfillments see family life parents add needless sorrows lives children keeping choices expectations preferences search happiness reminds road traveling full potholes traveling bumpy road realized happiness always appears life unusual shapes sounds sizes Hence little puddles humor fun playfulness joys everywhere Moreover search happiness unearthed essential ingredients happy life live happy life firstly need respect admire others unique ways world like make noise others crave silence like front others like shout back Hence rather comparing people need admire people like engage people respect increase improve human relationships way relate essential happy life next ingredient happy life need enough courage avoid becoming chasing shadow people’s expectations projections desires Without courage life would nothing tedious circle compulsions compromises also takes enormous courage satisfied right Finally much happiness depends ability let go sense control world imperfections life unfolds people decide act react us beyond absolute control Hence rather holding onto ropes expectations tightly need let go enjoy remains experience life random surprises that’s happiness Sources Happiness important source happiness life us want sooner later rather streams happiness begin sprout life abundantly begin realize human life indeed little can’t go postponing happiness attaching event situation achievement may never encounter short life None us written script life us strive toward dreams possibilities often drama life turns way never suspected find happiness messy confusing moments life need recognize patterns human life unwritten uncalled unpredictable Even utmost preparedness none us systematically dictate course life Therefore order live happy life need replace concept happiness destination concept happiness process much happiness experience life depends react happening around

misconception conservative thinkers monolithic block people think alike situations nuances go forming ideologies intricate thoughtful based deep realism history culture society human psychology Take case Edmund Burke patron saint founder modernday conservatism eighteenth century example Burke adamantly stood kind revolution à la French Revolution taking place England also stood English monarchy came treatment colonized people supported sovereignty colonized based recognition rights led impeachment trial Warren Hastings erstwhile GovernorGeneral Bengal accused corruption maltreatment Indian people Whig regularly voiced opposition King George III’s government advocated England’s policies support revolutionaries America Americans feel indebted day Reflections Revolution France published 1790 year fall Bastille Burke urged caution radical changes declared “society partnership dead living unborn”—a quote invoked ad nauseam many conservative thinkers often without full realization meaning Burke doubted efficacy changes brought “social engineering” argued favor change gradual organic spiral violence lasted generations postrevolutionary France fact vindicated Burke slowly surely put pedestal thinkers conservative persuasion later followed footsteps Burke wasn’t suspicious radical changes also questioned whether reason human rationality alone could solve human afflictions Given Burke’s skepticism efficacy social engineering via radical change pessimism human nature often wondered Burke would think changes Nepal book Conservative Mind American political thinker Russell Kirk writes “Burke expectation men kept social change neither rigidity form desirable Change inevitable designed providentially larger conservation society properly guided change process renewal” words Burke supports social change long properly guided done piecemeal manner change leads renewal societies even greater bonding communities “A state without means change” Burke contends “is without means conservation” respect equality Burke writes Whatever man separately without trespassing upon others right right fair portion society combinations skill force favor partnership men equal rights equal things Burke indeed egalitarian believe social hierarchies however also strongly believe equal justice natural right equal dividend anticipated follies violence communism—which tries level

public rely secondary information sciencejournalists usually various incentives communicate information deem fit – nature job – thoroughly understand science Adding paywall sciencepublishing ecosystems simply restrict public access – even scientifically literate people independent researchers like would benefit immensely literature could eventually lead perception scientific journals purely profitdriven thus counterproductive distribution information transparency – could instead reinforce affirmations conspiracy theorists science deniers 21st century scientific community long recognized problem currently immense effort establish openaccess publications ie free paywall people may argue maintaining scientific journals expensive resourceintensive referees need compensation work logistical expenses However major publishing companies thriving profitdriven model makes argument less compelling Majority research development paid one way taxpayer money yet 1525 scientific
